 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

 

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers including mixeduse assets and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to

 

                    

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition openair shopping centers including mixeduse assets or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

 

we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other investment or development opportunities

 

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants ’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases

 

 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

 

ecommerce and other changes in consumer buying practices present challenges for many of our tenants and may require us to modify our properties diversify our tenant composition and adapt our leasing practices to remain competitive 

 

many of our tenants face increasing competition from ecommerce and other sources that could cause them to reduce their size limit the number of locations andor suffer a general downturn in their businesses and ability to pay rent we may also fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting change in retailing practices and space needs of our tenants which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows we are focused on anchoring and diversifying our properties with tenants that are more resistant to competition from ecommerce eg groceries essential retailers restaurants and service providers but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in modifying our properties diversifying our tenant composition andor adapting our leasing practices

 

our expenses may remain constant or increase even if income from our combined shopping center portfolio decreases which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

costs associated with our business such as common area expenses utilities insurance real estate taxes mortgage payments and corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease in the event that a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease in addition inflation could result in higher operating costs if we are unable to lower our operating costs when revenues decline andor are unable to pass along cost increases to our tenants our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted

 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale in addition the code includes certain restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we may utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

 

 

we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties 

 

we operate are currently developing and may in the future develop properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as “mixeduse” developments this means that in addition to the development of retail space the project may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do with retail real estate as a result if a development project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of nonretail real estate in addition even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves including providing any necessary financing in the case of residential properties these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent in the case of office properties the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology economic conditions and business culture declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants in the case of hotel properties the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism because we have less experience with residential office and hotel properties than with retail properties we expect to retain thirdparties to manage our residential and other nonretail components as deemed warranted if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a thirdparty manager we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us 

 

construction projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

 

in the event that we decide to redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials and labor which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

supply chain disruptions and unexpected construction expenses and delays could impact our ability to timely deliver spaces to tenants andor our ability to achieve the expected value of a construction project or lease thereby adversely affecting our profitability 

 

the construction and building industry similar to many other industries are experiencing worldwide supply chain disruptions due to a multitude of factors that are beyond our control materials parts and labor have also increased in cost over the past year or more sometimes significantly and over a short period of time we may incur costs for a property renovation or tenant buildout that exceeds our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that are unexpected we also may be unable to complete renovation of a property or tenant space on schedule due to supply chain disruptions or labor shortages which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally some tenants may have the right to terminate their leases if a renovation project is not completed on time the time frame required to recoup our renovation and construction costs and to realize a return on such costs can often be significant and materially adversely affect our profitability

 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of the ada or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties

 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or a partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as

 

       

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

 

 

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

 

      

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments

 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and footnote 9 to the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion regarding the shares held by the company of albertsons companies inc “aci”

 

our investments in mortgage receivables are subject to specific risks relating to the borrower and the underlying property in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property collateralizing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the properties collateralizing our loans

 

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

 

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including

 

     

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset’s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value

 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

 

we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired a property’s value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property in our estimate of cash flows we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans intended holding periods and available market information we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken

 

 

we intend to continue to sell our lesser quality assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our lesser quality properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we have completed our efforts to exit mexico chile brazil peru and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

 

our international operations have included properties in mexico chile brazil peru and canada and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past practices will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks and security incidents which could cause loss of confidential information disrupt operations and materially affect our business and financial results 

 

we like all businesses are subject to cyberattacks and security incidents which threaten the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and information resources those attacks and incidents may be due to intentional or unintentional acts by employees contractors or thirdparties who seek to gain unauthorized access to our or our service providers’ systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information through malware computer viruses ransomware social engineering eg phishing attachments to emails or other vectors a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources 

 

the risk of a cybersecurity breach or operational disruption particularly through a cyber incident including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our information technology “it” networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging

 

employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business the number of points of potential cyberattack such as laptops and mobile devices have increased and any failure to effectively manage these risks including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure may adversely affect our business cyber criminals are targeting their attacks on individual employees utilizing interest in pandemic related information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds or steal credentials that compromise information systems which extend to multiple platforms throughout the company

 

while we maintain some of our own critical it networks and related systems we also depend on thirdparties to provide important software technologies tools and a broad array of services and functions such as payroll human resources electronic communications and certain finance functions among others in addition in the ordinary course of our business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information

 

our measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats such as password protection firewalls backup servers threat monitoring log aggregation vulnerability scanning data encryption periodic penetration testing and multifactor authentication may not be successful in preventing a security incident or data breach or limiting the effects of such a breach furthermore the security measures employed by thirdparty service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems this is particularly so because attack methodologies change frequently or are not recognized until launched and we also may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls to avoid detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence

 

 

the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyberattack or security incident include operational interruption damage to our relationship with our tenants and private data exposure we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address an attack or incident which may not be covered or fully covered by our insurance and which may involve payments for investigations forensic analyses legal advice public relations advice system repair or replacement or other services in addition to any remedies or relief that may result from legal proceedings our financial results may be negatively impacted by such attacks and incidents or any resulting negative media attention

 

a cyber incident could

 

          

the company has cybersecurity coverage incorporated in its insurance policies however these policies may not be sufficient to cover any or all expenses associated with the aforementioned risks moreover cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business

 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the company has environmental insurance coverage on certain of its properties however this coverage may not be sufficient to cover any or all expenses associated with the aforementioned risks 

 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes snowstorms floods and fires and the frequency of these natural disasters and severe weather conditions may increase due to climate change the occurrence of natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change including extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases can delay new development or redevelopment projects decreases the attractiveness of locations increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties or make repair or replacement impossible increase operation costs including the cost of energy at our properties increase costs for future property insurance negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage the incurrence of any of these losses costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact the decisions and analysis we make with respect to our properties since climate change considerations can impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring real estate properties in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

pandemics or other health crises may adversely affect our tenants ’ financial condition and the profitability of our properties 

 

our business and the businesses of our tenants could be materially and adversely affected by the risks or the public perception of the risks related to a pandemic or other health crisis such as the outbreak of novel coronavirus covid19

 

 

such events could result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants’ manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in our tenants’ supply chains from local and international suppliers and or delays in the delivery of our tenants’ inventory

 

the profitability of our properties depends in part on the willingness of customers to visit our tenants’ businesses the risk or public perception of the risk of a pandemic or media coverage of infectious diseases could cause employees or customers to avoid our properties which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants’ businesses and our tenants’ ability to adequately staff their businesses such events could adversely impact tenants’ sales andor cause the temporary closure of our tenants’ businesses which could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the company ’ s business financial condition results of operations or stock price has and may continue to be adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and such impact could be material 

 

in march 2020 the outbreak of covid19 was recognized as a pandemic by the who the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses economies and financial markets worldwide the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the retail sector in which the company operates the majority of the company’s tenants and their operations have been and may continue to be impacted through the duration of the pandemic a substantial number of tenants had to temporarily or permanently close their business shortened their operating hours or offer reduced services for some period of time impacts of new variants of covid19 could result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants’ manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in our tenants’ supply chains from local and international suppliers andor delays in the delivery of our tenants’ inventory

 

new variants of covid19 could adversely affect our tenants’ businesses and our tenants’ ability to adequately staff their businesses such events could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a downturn in our tenants’ businesses that significantly weakens their financial condition could cause them to delay lease commencements or decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration and could lead to additional failures to make rental payments when due store closures or bankruptcies and we may be unable to collect past due balances under relevant leases

 

the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to among other factors

         

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations financial condition and stock price will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain and which we may not be able to predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response the impact on our employees and other operational disruptions or difficulties we may face the effect on our tenants and their businesses the ability of tenants to pay their contracted rents and any additional closures of our tenants’ businesses these effects individually or in the aggregate could adversely impact our tenant’s ability to pay their contracted rent any of these events could materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or stock price

 

 

financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could materially and adversely affect the company ’ s business 

 

worldwide financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility resulting in heightened credit risk reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity moreover many companies have experienced reduced liquidity and uncertainty as to their ability to raise capital during such periods of market disruption and volatility in the event that these conditions recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn our results of operations financial position or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected these market conditions may affect the companys ability to access debt and equity capital markets in addition as a result of recent financial events we may face increased regulation

 

corporate responsibility specifically related to esg factors and commitments imposes additional costs and expose us to new risks 

 

the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon esg or “sustainability” metrics many investment funds focus on positive esg business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision in addition investors particularly institutional investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging these investors may engage with companies to require improved esg disclosure or performance we may face reputational damage or additional costs in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than previous years a low sustainability score could result in a negative perception of the company or exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead in addition as part of our corporate responsibility we have adopted certain esg goals including greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and other sustainability initiatives if we cannot not meet these goals fully or on time we may face reputational damage

 

our success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of key personnel including our executive officers to manage our daytoday operations and strategic business direction our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel may significantly impact our future performance and if any of our executive officers or other key personnel depart the company for any reason we may not be able to easily replace such individual the loss of the services of our executive officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

risks related to our debt and equity securities 

 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our financial condition and our results of operations 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as

 

      

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

 

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

 

our credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future 

 

we have substantial indebtedness including indebtedness assumed in the merger with weingarten the level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences on our business such as

 

           

the impact of any of these potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 

impacts from transition away from london interbank offered rate  “ libor ”  

 

a portion of our longterm indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of us dollars libor and certain other interest “benchmarks” may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in march 2021 the ice benchmark administration limited the administrator of libor extended the transition dates of certain libor tenors to june 30 2023 after which libor reference rates will cease to be provided despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 it is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis after such dates if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected

 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

 

        

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 

our charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent a change of control transaction even if such a change in control may be in our best interest and as a result may depress the market price of our securities 

 

our charter contains certain ownership limits our charter contains various provisions that are intended to preserve our qualification as a reit and subject to certain exceptions authorize our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit  for example our charter prohibits the actual beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 98 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock our board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion may exempt a person prospectively or retroactively from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may

 

   

risks related to our status as a reit and related us federal income tax matters 

 

loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in us federal income tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes

 

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the us internal revenue service the “irs” and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments

 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock the composition of our assets and the sources of our gross income also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

 

if we were to lose our reit status we would face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available to pay distributions to stockholders for each of the years involved because

 

     

our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in us federal income tax laws including with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities

 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular us federal corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock

 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “ prohibited transactions ” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

 

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors or is held through a taxable reit subsidiary such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

 

 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

 

the maximum tax rate applicable to “qualified dividend income” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates is 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for these reduced rates us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys openair shopping centers are usually anchored by a grocery store home improvement centers offprice retailer discounter or serviceoriented tenant as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and the nations largest owner and operator of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot albertsons companies ross stores amazonwhole foods market petsmart ahold delhaize kroger burlington stores and walmart

 

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2021 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 14 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 14 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2021 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot albertsons companies ross stores and amazonwhole foods market which represented 37 22 20 19 and 19 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

 

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers certain of the leases provide for the payment of a fixedrate reimbursement of these such expenses although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for reimbursements by the tenant as part of common area maintenance additionally many of the leases provide for reimbursements by the tenant of capital expenditures

covid19 pandemic 

 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected businesses economies and financial markets worldwide the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the retail sector in which the company operates the majority of the company’s tenants and their operations have been and may continue to be impacted through the duration of the pandemic a substantial number of tenants had to temporarily or permanently close their business shortened their operating hours or offer reduced services for some period of time

 

 

the development and distribution of covid19 vaccines has assisted in allowing many restrictions to be lifted providing a path to recovery the us economy continues to build upon the reopening trend as businesses reopen to full capacity and stimulus is flowing through to the consumer the overall economy continues to recover but several issues including lack of qualified employees inflation risk supply chain bottlenecks and covid19 variants have impacted the pace of the recovery 

 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the near term will continue to depend on future developments which continue to be uncertain including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 variants the distribution and effectiveness as well as the willingness to take the vaccines the impact of covid19 on economic activity the effect of covid19 on the company’s tenants and their businesses the ability of tenants to make their rental payments and any additional closures of tenants’ businesses 

 

the company continues to monitor the impact of covid19 on the company’s business tenants and industry as a whole the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the company’s operations and liquidity remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to evolve globally and within the united states the company will continue to monitor the economic financial and social conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators in addition the company will continue to monitor for any material or adverse effects resulting from the covid19 pandemic if the company determines that any of its assets are impaired the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material

 

although the company continues to see an increase in collections of rental payments the effects covid19 have had on its tenants are still heavily considered when evaluating the adequacy of the collectability of the tenant’s total accounts receivable balance including the corresponding straightline rent receivable as of december 31 2021 the company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance was 35 potentially uncollectible including receivables from tenants that are being accounted for on a cash basis and 11 of the company’s straightline rent receivables were potentially uncollectible also inclusive of tenants that are being accounted for on a cash basis these reserves are primarily attributable to the impact from the covid19 pandemic management’s estimate of the collectability of accrued rents and accounts receivable is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation the company will continue to monitor the economic financial and social conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic and will continue to assess the collectability of its tenant accounts receivables as such the company may determine that further adjustments to its accounts receivable may be required in the future and such amounts may be material

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations the convenience and availability of ecommerce has continued to impact the retail sector which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases andor lease available space to mitigate the effect of ecommerce on its business the company’s strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers including grocery stores offprice retailers discounters or serviceoriented tenants which offer buy online and pick up in store offprice merchandise and daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items

 

the company’s portfolio is focused on major metropolitanarea us markets predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sun belt region which are supported by strong demographics significant projected population growth and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry the company owns a predominantly groceryanchored portfolio clustered in the nation’s top markets which positioned the company to overcome many of the challenges brought upon by covid19 the company believes it can continue to increase its occupancy levels rental rates and overall rental growth in addition the company on a selective basis has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixeduse components

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company may continue to dispose of certain properties if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results performance or transactions see item 1a “risk factors”

funds from operations 

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies nareit defines ffo as net incomeloss available to the company’s common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding i depreciation and amortization related to real estate ii gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets iii gains and losses from change in control iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis the company also made an election per the nareit funds from operations white paper2018 restatement to exclude from its calculation of ffo i gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and ii marktomarket changes in the value of its equity securities as such the company does not include gainsimpairments on land parcels gainslosses realized or unrealized from marketable securities allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables or gainsimpairments on preferred equity participations in nareit defined ffo

 

the company presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo available to the company’s common shareholders when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity

 

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to ffo available to the company’s common shareholders is reflected in the table below in thousands except per share data

 

  

  

same property net operating income 

 

same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods it excludes properties under redevelopment development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties

 

 

for the three months ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the company included same property noi from the weingarten properties acquired through the merger as the company owned these properties for the full three months ended december 31 2021 the amount of the adjustment relating to weingarten same property noi for the three months ended december 31 2020 included in the table below represents the same property noi from weingarten properties prior to the merger which is not included in the companys net income available to the company’s common shareholders same property noi from properties acquired through the merger was excluded for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 as the company did not own these properties for the full year ended december 31 2021

 

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees tifs and amortization of abovebelowmarket rents less charges for bad debt operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating same property noi available to the company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to same property noi in thousands

 

  

   

same property noi increased by 357 million or 129 for the three months ended december 31 2021 as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 this increase is primarily the result of i a decrease in credit losses of 157 million due to increased collections ii an increase in revenues from rental properties of 114 million primarily related to a decrease in tenant rent abatements and vacancies as a result of the covid19 pandemic during 2020 as compared to 2021 and iii an increase of 86 million from properties acquired through the merger

 

same property noi increased by 696 million or 88 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 this increase is primarily the result of i a decrease in credit losses of 923 million due to increased collections partially offset by ii a decrease in revenues from rental properties of 188 million primarily related to a decrease in tenant rent abatements and vacancies as a result of the covid19 pandemic and iii an increase in nonrecoverable operating expenses of 39 million

 

effects of inflation 

 

many of the companys longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor as a result of escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

 

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to

 

                     

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

 

we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases

 

 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

 

our expenses may remain constant or increase even if income from our combined shopping center portfolio decreases which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

costs associated with our business such as common area expenses utilities insurance real estate taxes mortgage payments and corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease in the event that a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease in addition inflation could result in higher operating costs if we are unable to lower our operating costs when revenues decline andor are unable to pass along cost increases to our tenants our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted

 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale in addition the code includes certain restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we may utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

 

 

we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties 

 

we operate are currently developing and may in the future develop properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as “mixeduse” developments this means that in addition to the development of retail space the project may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do with retail real estate as a result if a development project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of nonretail real estate in addition even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves including providing any necessary financing in the case of residential properties these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent in the case of office properties the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology economic conditions and business culture declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants in the case of hotel properties the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism because we have less experience with residential office and hotel properties than with retail properties we expect to retain thirdparties to manage our residential and other nonretail components as deemed warranted if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a thirdparty manager we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us 

 

construction projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

  

in the event that we decide to redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials and labor which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

  

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the “ada” investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of the ada or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties

 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or a partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as

 

       

 

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us  

 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and footnote 9 to the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion regarding the shares held by the company of albertsons companies inc “aci”

 

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

 

      

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments

 

our investments in mortgage receivables are subject to specific risks relating to the borrower and the underlying property in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

 

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

 

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including

 

     

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset’s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value

 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

  

we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired a property’s value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property in our estimate of cash flows we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans intended holding periods and available market information we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken

 

 

we intend to continue to sell our lesser quality assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our lesser quality properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico and have completely exited chile brazil peru and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

 

our international operations have included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect our business cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations 

 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware computer viruses ransomware attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption particularly through a cyber incident including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging

 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business the number of points of potential cyberattack such as laptops and mobile devices have increased and any failure to effectively manage these risks including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure may adversely affect our business cyber criminals are targeting their attacks on individual employees utilizing interest in pandemic related information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds or steal credentials that compromise information systems which extend to multiple platforms throughout the company 

 

while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems we also depend on thirdparties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions such as payroll human resources electronic communications and certain finance functions our measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection firewalls backup servers threat monitoring log aggregation vulnerability scanning data encryption periodic penetration testing and multifactor authentication may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach furthermore the security measures employed by thirdparty service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems

 

the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationship with our tenants and private data exposure we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any data security incident or breach which may not be covered or fully covered by our insurance and which may involve payments for investigations forensic analyses legal advice public relations advice system repair or replacement or other services our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or any resulting negative media attention

 

a cyber incident could

 

         

 

moreover cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business

 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes snowstorms floods and fires and the frequency of these natural disasters and severe weather conditions may increase due to climate change the occurrence of natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change can delay new development or redevelopment projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs including the cost of energy at our properties increase costs for future property insurance negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage the incurrence of any of these losses costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

pandemics or other health crises may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition and the profitability of our properties 

  

our business and the businesses of our tenants could be materially and adversely affected by the risks or the public perception of the risks related to a pandemic or other health crisis such as the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus covid19

 

such events could result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants’ manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in our tenants’ supply chains from local and international suppliers and or delays in the delivery of our tenants’ inventory 

 

the profitability of our properties depends in part on the willingness of customers to visit our tenants’ businesses the risk or public perception of the risk of a pandemic or media coverage of infectious diseases could cause employees or customers to avoid our properties which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants’ businesses and our tenants’ ability to adequately staff their businesses such events could adversely impact tenants’ sales andor cause the temporary closure of our tenants’ businesses which could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the company’s business financial condition results of operations or stock price has and may continue to be adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and such impact could be material 

 

in march 2020 the outbreak of covid19 was recognized as a pandemic by the who the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has had a significant adverse effect on businesses economies and financial markets worldwide and has caused significant volatility in us and international debt and equity markets there is significant uncertainty around the extent and duration of business disruptions related to covid19 as well as its longterm impact on the us economy

 

our business and the businesses of our tenants have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and actions taken to contain or prevent its spread a substantial number of tenants have temporarily or permanently closed their businesses have shortened their operating hours or offered reduced services as a result the company has also had a substantial number of tenants that have made late or partial rent payments requested a deferral of rent payments forgiveness of rent payments or defaulted on rent payments and it is likely that more of our tenants will be similarly impacted in the future impacts of covid19 could also result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants’ manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in our tenants’ supply chains from local and international suppliers andor delays in the delivery of our tenants’ inventory

 

 

even after governmental restrictions are lifted our tenants may continue to be impacted by economic conditions resulting from covid19 or public perception of the risk of covid19 which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants’ businesses and our tenants’ ability to adequately staff their businesses such events could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a downturn in our tenants’ businesses that significantly weakens their financial condition could cause them to delay lease commencements or decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration and could lead to additional failures to make rental payments when due store closures or bankruptcies and we may be unable to collect past due balances under relevant leases we have received requests for rent relief from some of our tenants we are assessing these requests on a casebycase basis and have agreed and may continue to agree to certain relief it is likely there will be additional requests for relief in the future

 

in addition like many other companies due to government mandates we have instructed our employees to work from home which especially if this persists for a prolonged period of time may have an adverse impact on our employees operations and systems extended periods of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business while most of our operations can be performed remotely there is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed many employees may have additional personal needs to attend to and employees may become sick themselves and be unable to work decreased effectiveness of our team could adversely affect our results due to our inability to meet in person with potential tenants longer time periods to review and approve leases longer time to respond to tenant and property issues or other decreases in productivity that could seriously harm our business

 

the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate and on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to among other factors

         

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations financial condition and stock price will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain and which we may not be able to predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response the impact on our employees and other operational disruptions or difficulties we may face the effect on our tenants and their businesses the ability of tenants to pay their contracted rents and any additional closures of our tenants’ businesses these effects individually or in the aggregate will adversely impact our tenant’s ability to pay their contracted rent any of these events could materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or stock price

 

financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could materially and adversely affect the company’s business 

 

worldwide financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility which has been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic resulting in heightened credit risk reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity moreover many companies have experienced reduced liquidity and uncertainty as to their ability to raise capital during such periods of market disruption and volatility in the event that these conditions recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn our results of operations financial position or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected these market conditions may affect the companys ability to access debt and equity capital markets in addition as a result of recent financial events we may face increased regulation

 

 

corporate responsibility specifically related to esg factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

 

the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon esg or “sustainability” metrics many investment funds focus on positive esg business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision in addition investors particularly institutional investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging these investors may engage with companies to require improved esg disclosure or performance we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than previous years a low sustainability score could result in a negative perception of the company or exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead

 

our success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of key personnel including our executive officers to manage our daytoday operations and strategic business direction our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel may significantly impact our future performance and if any of our executive officers or other key personnel depart the company for any reason we may not be able to easily replace such individual the loss of the services of our executive officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

risks related to our debt and equity securities 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our financial condition and our results of operations 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as

 

      

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

 

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

 

our credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

 

impacts from transition away from london interbank offered rate “libor” 

 

a portion of our longterm indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of us dollars libor and certain other interest “benchmarks” may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve in november 2020 ice benchmark association the administrator of libor published a consultation regarding its intention to cease publication of us dollar libor after june 2023 if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected

 

 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

 

        

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 

our charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent a change of control transaction even if such a change in control may be in our best interest and as a result may depress the market price of our securities 

 

our charter contains certain ownership limits our charter contains various provisions that are intended to preserve our qualification as a reit and subject to certain exceptions authorize our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit  for example our charter prohibits the actual beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 98 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock our board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion may exempt a person prospectively or retroactively from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may

 

  

risks related to our status as a reit and related us federal income tax matters 

 

loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in us federal income tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the us internal revenue service the irs and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments

 

 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock the composition of our assets and the sources of our gross income also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

 

if we were to lose our reit status we would face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because

 

     

our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in us federal income tax laws including with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities

 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular us federal corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock

 

 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

 

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

 

the maximum tax rate applicable to “qualified dividend income” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates is 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for these reduced rates us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

  

 

valuation of joint venture investments and other investments 

 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period

 

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt which may be guaranteed by the joint venture the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates

 

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

 

the company is subject to us federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trss and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted

 

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance which requires significant judgement from management should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance

 

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

covid19 pandemic 

 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses economies and financial markets worldwide and has caused significant volatility in us and international debt and equity markets the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the retail sector in which the company operates and if the effects of the pandemic are prolonged it could continue to have a significant adverse impact on the underlying industries of many of the company’s tenants the majority of the company’s tenants and their operations have been impacted and may continue to be impacted affecting their ability to pay rent through the duration of the pandemic a substantial number of tenants have had to temporarily or permanently close their business shortened their operating hours or offer reduced services for some period of time

 

as a result of the current economic uncertainty and the impact to many of the company’s tenants the company has taken important steps to offer its support including

      

as of december 31 2020 mandated or voluntary tenant closures represented 27 of annual base rent for all of the companys wholly owned locations and the companys share of ownership in joint ventures collectively the prorata annual base rent as a result the company has also had a substantial number of tenants that have made late or partial rent payments requested a deferral of rent payments forgiveness of rent payments or defaulted on rent payments and it is likely that more of the company’s tenants will be similarly impacted in the future from the onset of the covid19 pandemic the company granted selective deferrals for approximately 9 of its prorata annual base rent forgave rental payments aggregating 137 million of prorata rents collection rates have steadily increased from 74 of its prorata annual base rent for second quarter ended june 30 2020 to 92 for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2020 with rates increasing each quarter the company continues to negotiate for the payment of the remaining rents not yet collected as well as work with tenants to grant rent waivers on a lease by lease basis the deferrals generally have a repayment period of six to 18 months the company has also collected 91 of the prorata annual base rent for the month of january 2021

 

the company considered the impacts covid19 has had on its tenants when evaluating the adequacy of the collectability of the lessee’s total accounts receivable balance including the corresponding straightline rent receivable during the year ended december 31 2020 the company’s revenue was reduced by 810 million associated with potentially uncollectible revenues including revenues from tenants that are being accounted for on a cash basis which includes 152 million for straightline rent receivables primarily attributable to the covid19 pandemic since the covid19 pandemic began the company has seen an increase in the number of tenants filing for bankruptcy some of which emerged from bankruptcy prior to december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 there were 38 leases or 07 of prorata annual base rent within the company’s portfolio associated with tenants in bankruptcy the company continues to evaluate the impact these bankruptcy filings have or will have on collections vacancies and future rental income management’s estimate of the collectability of accrued rents and accounts receivable is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation the company will continue to monitor the economic financial and social conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic and will continue to assess the collectability of its tenant accounts receivables as such the company may determine that further adjustments to its accounts receivable may be required in the future and such amounts may be material

 

the impact of covid19 on the company’s future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 the success of governmental business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to covid19 the impact of covid19 on economic activity the effect of covid19 on the company’s tenants and their businesses the ability of tenants to make their rental payments and any additional closures of tenants’ businesses 

 

the company continues to monitor the impact of covid19 on the company’s business tenants and industry as a whole the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the company’s operations and liquidity remains uncertain as this pandemic continues to evolve globally and within the united states management cannot at this point estimate ultimate losses related to the covid19 pandemic the company will continue to monitor the economic financial and social conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators if the company determines that any of its assets are impaired the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material see footnote 6 to the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding impairment charges

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations the convenience and availability of ecommerce has continued to impact the retail sector which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases andor lease available space to mitigate the effect of ecommerce on its business the company’s strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers including grocery stores offprice retailers discounters or serviceoriented tenants which offer buy online and pick up in store offprice merchandise and daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items

 

over the past several years the company has transformed its portfolio focusing on major metropolitanarea us markets predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sunbelt region which are supported by strong demographics significant projected population growth and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry given this significant transformation successfully executed over the last several years the company now owns a predominantly groceryanchored portfolio clustered in the nation’s top markets which positioned the company to overcome many of the challenges brought upon by covid19 the company believes that this transformed portfolio will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels rental rates and rental growth in addition the company on a selective basis has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixeduse components

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company may continue to dispose of certain properties if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results performance or transactions see item 1a “risk factors”

funds f rom operations 

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies nareit defines ffo as net incomeloss available to the company’s common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding i depreciation and amortization related to real estate ii gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets iii gains and losses from change in control iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis the company also made an election per the nareit funds from operations white paper2018 restatement to exclude from its calculation of ffo i gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and ii marktomarket changes in the value of its equity securities as such the company does not include gainsimpairments on land parcels gainslosses realized or unrealized from marketable securities allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables or gainsimpairments on preferred equity participations in nareit defined ffo as a result of this election the company will no longer disclose ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted “ffo as adjusted” as an additional supplemental measure the incidental adjustments noted above which were previously excluded from nareit ffo and used to determine ffo as adjusted are now included in nareit ffo and therefore the company believes ffo as adjusted is no longer necessary

 

the company presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo available to the company’s common shareholders when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo available to the company’s common shareholders may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

 

 

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to ffo available to the company’s common shareholders is reflected in the table below in thousands except per share data

 

  

   

same property net operating income 

 

same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods it excludes properties under redevelopment development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties

 

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees tifs and amortization of abovebelow market rents less charges for bad debt operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating same property noi available to the company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

 

 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to same property noi in thousands

 

  

same property noi decreased by 226 million or 105 for the three months ended december 31 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 which is primarily the result of a reduction of revenue associated with potentially uncollectible revenues

 

same property noi decreased by 680 million or 80 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 which is primarily the result of a reduction of revenue associated with potentially uncollectible revenues

 

effects of inflation 

 

many of the companys longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor as a result of escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

business objective and strateg ies 

 

strategy overview 

 

the company’s strategy is to continue to focus on its three core principles

    

over the past several years the company has transformed its portfolio focusing on major metropolitanarea us markets predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sunbelt region which are supported by strong demographics significant projected population growth and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry as of december 31 2019 the company derived 844 of its annualized base rent from its top major metro markets

 

the company’s focus on highquality locations has led to significant opportunities for value creation through the reinvestment in its assets to add density replace outdated shopping center concepts and better meet changing consumer demands the company continues to place strategic emphasis on liveworkplay environments and in reinvesting in its existing assets while building shareholder value this philosophy is further exemplified by the company’s signature series tm properties dania pointe grand parkway marketplace kentlands market square lincoln square mill station pentagon centre suburban square and the boulevard

 

the strength and security of the company’s balance sheet remains central to its strategy the company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position are evidenced by its investment grade unsecured debt ratings baa1bbbbbb by all three major ratings agencies the company maintains one of the longest average debt maturity profiles in the reit industry now at 106 years the company has taken meaningful steps to reduce leverage unencumber assets and further improve its debt coverage metrics as redevelopment and development projects continue to come online and contribute additional cash flow growth

 

 

business objective 

 

the company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of openair shopping centers in the us the company believes it can achieve this objective by

     

operating strateg ies 

 

the company’s operating strategies are to i own and operate its shopping center properties at their highest potential through maximizing and maintaining rental income and occupancy levels ii attract local area customers to its shopping centers which offer buy online and pick up in store offprice merchandise and daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items and iii maintain a strong balance sheet

 

to effectively execute these strategies the company seeks to

         

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2019 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 19 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 19 of the company’s total shopping center gla furthermore at december 31 2019 the company’s single largest tenant represented only 39 and the company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 124 of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

 

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of openair shopping centers the company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties

 

investment strategies 

  

the company’s investment strategy is to invest capital into its highquality assets which are tightly clustered in major metro markets that provide opportunity for growth while disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations through this strategy the company has transformed its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio property acquisitions are focused in major metro areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume accompanied with a potential for a mixed use component the company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels rental rates and rental growth

 

the company’s investment strategy also includes the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and acquired centers while also pursuing redevelopment opportunities to increase overall value within its portfolio the company may selectively acquire established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in geographic regions in which the company presently operates additionally the company may selectively acquire land parcels in its key markets for real estate development projects for longterm investment the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise the company also continues to simplify its business by reducing the number of joint venture investments

 

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has a capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain lesser quality assets if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material

 

the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property

information about our executive officers 

  

the following table sets forth information with respect to the executive officers of the company as of december 31 2019

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

 

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

 

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to

 

                   

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

 

we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases

 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

 

our expenses may remain constant or increase even if income from our combined shopping center portfolio decreases which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

costs associated with our business such as common area expenses utilities insurance real estate taxes mortgage payments and corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease in the event that a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease in addition inflation could result in higher operating costs if we are unable to lower our operating costs when revenues decline andor are unable to pass along cost increases to our tenants our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted

 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale in addition the code includes certain restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we may utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

 

unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth results of operations and cash flows 

  

real estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for longterm investment and construction of retail residential andor mixeduse properties as opportunities arise we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks

  

   

 

      

additionally new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management and the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return the foregoing risks could hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties 

 

we operate are currently developing and may in the future develop properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as “mixeduse” developments this means that in addition to the development of retail space the project may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do with retail real estate as a result if a development project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of nonretail real estate in addition even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves including providing any necessary financing in the case of residential properties these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent in the case of office properties the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology economic conditions and business culture declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants in the case of hotel properties the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism because we have less experience with residential office and hotel properties than with retail properties we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential and other nonretail components as deemed warranted if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a thirdparty manager we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us 

 

construction projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

  

in the event that we decide to redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials and labor which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

  

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the ada investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of the ada or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties

 

 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as

 

       

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in cost method investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

the economic performance and value of our cost method investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including

 

     

a decline in the value of our cost method investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset’s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value

 

our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 

  

we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired a property’s value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property in our estimate of cash flows we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans intended holding periods and available market information we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken

 

 

we intend to continue to sell our lesser quality assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our lesser quality properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico and have completely exited chile brazil peru and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

 

our international operations have included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect our business cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations 

 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption particularly through a cyber incident including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging

 

while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions such as payroll human resources electronic communications and certain finance functions our measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection firewalls backup servers threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach furthermore the security measures employed by thirdparty service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems

 

the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationship with our tenants and private data exposure our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention

 

a cyber incident could

 

         

moreover cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business

 

 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

 

  natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes snowstorms floods and fires and the frequency of these natural disasters and severe weather conditions may increase due to climate change the occurrence of natural disasters severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change can delay new development or redevelopment projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs including the cost of energy at our properties increase costs for future property insurance negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage the incurrence of any of these losses costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

  in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

pandemics or other health crises may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition and the profitability of our properties 

  

our business and the businesses of our tenants could be materially and adversely affected by the risks or the public perception of the risks related to a pandemic or other health crisis such as the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus covid19

 

such events could result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants’ manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in our tenants’ supply chains from local and international suppliers and or delays in the delivery of our tenants’ inventory 

 

the profitability of our properties depends in part on the willingness of customers to visit our tenants’ businesses the risk or public perception of the risk of a pandemic or media coverage of infectious diseases could cause employees or customers to avoid our properties which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants’ businesses and our tenants’ ability to adequately staff their businesses such events could adversely impact tenants’ sales andor cause the temporary closure of our tenants’ businesses which could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors “esg” may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

 

the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon environmental social and governance “esg” or “sustainability” metrics many investment funds focus on positive esg business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision in addition investors particularly institutional investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging these investors may engage with companies to require improved esg disclosure or performance we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause us to receive lower scores than previous years a low sustainability score could result in a negative perception of the company or exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead

 

  our success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

 

  we depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of key personnel including our executive officers to manage our daytoday operations and strategic business direction our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel may significantly impact our future performance and if any of our executive officers or other key personnel depart the company for any reason we may not be able to easily replace such individual the loss of the services of our executive officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

risks related to our debt and equity securities 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our financial condition and our results of operations  

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as

 

      

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

 

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

 

 

impacts from transition away from london interbank offered rate “libor” 

 

a portion of our longterm indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of us dollars libor and certain other interest “benchmarks” may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected

 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

 

        

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 

  our charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent a change of control transaction even if such a change in control may be in our best interest and as a result may depress the market price of our securities 

 

  our charter contains certain ownership limits our charter contains various provisions that are intended to preserve our qualification as a reit and subject to certain exceptions authorize our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit  for example our charter prohibits the actual beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 98 in value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 98 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock our board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion may exempt a person prospectively or retroactively from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may

 

• discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests or

 

• result in the transfer of shares acquired in excess of the restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and as a result the forfeiture by the acquirer of the benefits of owning the additional shares

 

risks related to our status as a reit and related us federal income tax matters 

 

loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in us federal income tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments

 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock the composition of our assets and the sources of our gross income also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

 

 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because

 

     

moreover the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax legislation significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders

 

the 2017 tax legislation remains unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it remains unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses us federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities

  

while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax legislation as a whole will have on us we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock

 

our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in us federal income tax laws including interpretations and regulations with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act and with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities

 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock

 

 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

 

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

 

  dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

 

  the maximum tax rate applicable to “qualified dividend income” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates is 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for these reduced rates under the 2017 tax legislation us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends ie dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits generally to 296 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income accordingly investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

 

real estate portfolio  as of december 31 2019 the company had interests in 409 shopping center properties aggregating 724 million square feet of gla located in 27 states and puerto rico in addition the company had 243 other property interests primarily through the company’s preferred equity investments and other real estate investments totaling 39 million square feet of gla openair shopping centers comprise the primary focus of the companys current portfolio as of december 31 2019 the company’s combined shopping center portfolio including noncontrolling interests was 964 leased

 

the companys openair shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of 176955 square feet as of december 31 2019 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with redevelopment major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2019 the company expended 1840 million in connection with property redevelopments and 1408 million related to improvements while expensing 283 million to operations

 

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys openair shopping centers are usually anchored by a grocery store offprice retailer discounter or serviceoriented tenant as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot ahold delhaize albertsons petsmart ross stores whole foods market bed bath  beyond walmart and burlington stores inc

 

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2019 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 19 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 19 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2019 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot ahold delhaize albertsons and petsmart which represented 39 25 21 20 and 18 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

valuation of real estate  including real estate under development and intangible assets and liabilities

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

  

valuation of joint venture investments and other investments 

 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period

 

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt which may be guaranteed by the joint venture the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments

 

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

 

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance which requires significant judgement from management should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance

 

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations the convenience and availability of ecommerce has continued to impact the retail sector which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases andor lease available space to mitigate the effect of ecommerce on its business the company’s strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers including grocery stores offprice retailers discounters or serviceoriented tenants which offer buy online and pick up in store offprice merchandise and daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items 

 

 

the company’s investment strategy is to invest capital into high quality assets focusing on major metropolitanarea us markets predominantly on the east and west coasts and in the sunbelt region which are supported by strong demographics significant projected population growth and where the company perceives significant barriers to entry while disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations through this strategy the company has transformed its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio the properties acquired are primarily located in major metropolitan areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume the company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels rental rates and rental growth in addition the company on a selective basis has developed or redeveloped projects which include residential and mixeduse components

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain properties if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results performance or transactions see item 1a “risk factors”

funds f rom operations 

 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies in december 2018 the nareit issued “nareit funds from operations white paper – 2018 restatement” the ffo 2018 restatement which clarifies where necessary existing guidance and consolidates alerts and policy bulletins into a single document for ease of use nareit defines ffo as net incomeloss available to the company’s common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding i depreciation and amortization related to real estate ii gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets iii gains and losses from change in control iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis included in the ffo 2018 restatement is an option for the company to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business in the calculation of ffo the main business of a reit is acquiring owning operating developing and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with its rental of real estate incidental assets may include but are not limited to land peripheral to operating properties property developed for sale and securities the ffo 2018 restatement is effective for annual periods beginning after december 31 2018 and interim periods reported within those periods

 

as a result of adopting the ffo 2018 restatement the company has elected to exclude gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and to exclude marktomarket changes in value of its equity securities in calculating ffo as such the company will no longer include gainsimpairments on land parcels gainslosses realized or unrealized from marketable securities or gainsimpairments on preferred equity participations in nareit defined ffo

 

the company presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo available to the company’s common shareholders when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits

 

the company also presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo available to the company’s common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo available to the company’s common shareholders and ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

 

 

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to ffo available to the company’s common shareholders and ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted is reflected in the table below in thousands except per share data in conjunction with the adoption of the ffo 2018 restatement the company has reclassified 34 million from transactional expense and 109 million from transactional income into ffo available to the company’s common shareholders for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 respectively relating to incidental gains and losses on the sale of assets and marktomarket changes in equity securities this reclassification had no impact on ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted for the three months and year ended december 31 2018

 

  

   

same property net operating income “ s ame property noi” 

 

same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods it excludes properties under redevelopment development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties

 

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees tifs and amortization of abovebelow market rents less charges for bad debt operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating same property noi available to the company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

 

 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to same property noi in thousands

 

  

same property noi increased by 56 million or 27 for the three months ended december 31 2019 as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 64 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio partially offset by ii a decrease in other property income of 08 million

 

same property noi increased by 244 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 251 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio partially offset by ii a decrease in other property income of 07 million

 

 

effects of inflation 

 

many of the companys longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor as a result of escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

business objective 

 

the company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of openair shopping centers in the us the company believes it can achieve this objective by

     

 

 

operating strateg ies 

 

the company’s operating strategies are to i own and operate its shopping center properties at their highest potential through maximizing and maintaining rental income and occupancy levels ii attract local area customers to its shopping centers which offer offprice merchandise and daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items and iii maintain a strong balance sheet

 

to effectively execute these strategies the company seeks to

         

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2018 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 18 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 17 of the company’s total shopping center gla furthermore at december 31 2018 the company’s single largest tenant represented only 37 and the company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 122 of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

 

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of openair shopping centers the company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties

 

investment strategies 

  

the company’s investment strategy is to invest capital into high quality assets which are concentrated in major metro markets that provide opportunity for growth while disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations through this strategy the company has steadily progressed in its transformation of its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio the properties acquired are primarily located in major metro areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume the company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels rental rates and rental growth

 

the company’s investment strategy also includes the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and acquired centers while also pursuing redevelopment opportunities to increase overall value within its portfolio the company may selectively acquire established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in geographic regions in which the company presently operates additionally the company may selectively acquire land parcels in its key markets for real estate development projects for longterm investment the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise the company also continues to simplify its business by reducing the number of joint venture investments

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain properties if the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material

 

the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property

 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

 

the company is focused on building a thriving and sustainable business one that succeeds by delivering longterm value for its stakeholders the company takes pride in how it conducts business including the positive contribution it makes to communities and its initiatives to safeguard the environment

 

by investing in technologies and improved processes the company has delivered significant yearoveryear reductions in energy consumption across its portfolio of properties including rethinking how it controls and lights its parking areas which reduces negative environmental impacts associated with fossilfuel based energy sources

 

the company’s responsibility efforts are not limited to promoting operational efficiency the company believes that sustainability leadership also requires an understanding of how environmental social and governance issues impact both its customers and the organization’s future growth prospects as a result it is taking steps to engage with its tenants on these issues and to better understand how the shopping centers it chooses to own and manage can grow in value by viewing them through this unique lens

 

 

to focus the company’s corporate responsibility efforts it has established a set of five strategic program priorities

      

for the fourth consecutive year the company was named to the dow jones sustainability north america index remaining the sole us retail owner among eligible companies the company also earned the green star designation by the global real estate sustainability benchmark “gresb” for the fifth year in a row and remains the topranked north american company among a peer group of openair retail property owners also for the first time the company achieved perfect scores in the categories of “management” and “policy and disclosure”

 

executive officers 

  

the following table sets forth information with respect to the executive officers of the company as of december 31 2018

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

 

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to

 

                   

 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

 

we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases

 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale in addition the code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

certain properties we own have a low tax basis which may result in a taxable gain on sale we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income however there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

 

 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

 

unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth results of operations and cash flows 

  

real estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for longterm investment and construction of retail residential andor mixeduse properties as opportunities arise we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks

  

        

additionally new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management and the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return the foregoing risks could hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties 

 

we operate are currently developing and may in the future develop properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as “mixeduse” developments this means that in addition to the development of retail space the project may also include space for residential office hotel or other commercial purposes we have less experience in developing and managing nonretail real estate than we do with retail real estate as a result if a development project includes a nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of nonretail real estate in addition even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves including providing any necessary financing in the case of residential properties these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent in the case of office properties the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology economic conditions and business culture declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants in the case of hotel properties the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism because we have less experience with residential office and hotel properties than with retail properties we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a thirdparty manager we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us 

 

construction and development projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

  

in the event that we decide to develop and construct new properties or redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as

 

       

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

 

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

 

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including

 

     

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset’s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value

 

 

we intend to continue to sell our nonstrategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

 

our international operations have included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect our business cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations 

 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption particularly through a cyber incident including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging

 

while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions such as payroll human resources electronic communications and certain finance functions our measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection firewalls backup servers threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach furthermore the security measures employed by thirdparty service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems

 

the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationship with our tenants and private data exposure our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention

 

a cyber incident could

 

         

moreover cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business

 

 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase costs for future property insurance negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

 

risks related to our debt and equity securities 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition  

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as

 

      

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

 

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

 

impacts from transition away from london interbank offered rate “libor” 

 

a portion of our longterm indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of us dollars libor and certain other interest “benchmarks” may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected

 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

 

        

 

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 

risks related to our status as a reit and related us federal income tax matters 

 

loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in us federal income tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments

 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because

 

     

moreover the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include

 

    

 

     

many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses us federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities

  

while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock

 

our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in us federal income tax laws including interpretations and regulations with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act and with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities

 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock

 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

 

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

valuation of real estate  including real estate under development and intangible assets and liabilities 

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance changes in anticipated holding period general market conditions and delays of development that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows net of anticipated construction and leasing costs undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future costs of materials and labor operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates

 

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

  

valuation of j oint v enture i nvestments and o ther i nvestments 

 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period

 

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt which may be guaranteed by the joint venture the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments

 

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment

 

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance which requires significant judgement from management should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance

 

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

the company presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo available to the company’s common shareholders when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits

 

the company also presents ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo available to the company’s common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees and amortization of abovebelow market rents less charges for bad debt operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating same property noi available to the company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

same property noi increased by 53 million or 26 for the three months ended december 31 2018 as compared to the corresponding period in 2017 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 56 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio partially offset by ii an increase of 02 million of credit losses and iii a decrease in other property income of 01 million

 

same property noi increased by 237 million or 29 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the corresponding period in 2017 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 246 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio partially offset by ii a decrease in other property income of 05 million and iii an increase of 04 million of credit losses

 

effects of inflation 

 

many of the companys longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

the company ’s initial growth resulted primarily from real estate under development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation and internationally within canada mexico and south america chile brazil and peru   the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics 

 

during 2013 the company began its efforts to exit its foreign investments due to perceived changes in market conditions as of december 31 2017 the company has substantially liquidated its investments in mexico and canada and has completely exited south america 

 

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the company ’s consolidated revenues were 12 billion 12 billion and 11 billion respectively which includes 03 million 06 million and 86 million respectively from the company’s consolidated foreign investments for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the company’s equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and preferred equity investments were 608 million 2187 million and 4804 million respectively which includes equity loss of 16 million equity income of 1490 million and equity income of 4084 million respectively from the company’s unconsolidated foreign investments see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further details regarding the company’s foreign investments 

 

business objective and strateg ies 

 

business objective 

 

the company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of openair shopping centers in the us the company believes it can achieve this objective by 

     

operating strateg ies 

 

the company’s operating strategies are to i own and operate its shopping center properties at their highest potential through maximizing and maintaining rental income and occupancy levels ii attract local area customers to its shopping centers which offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items and iii maintain a strong balance sheet 

 

to effectively execute these strategies the company seeks to 

         

 

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2017 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 18 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 16 of the company’s total shopping center gla furthermore at december 31 2017 the company’s single largest tenant represented only 36 and the company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 120 of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

 

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of openair shopping centers the company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company ’s properties 

 

investment strategies 

  

the company ’s investment strategy is to invest capital into high quality assets which are concentrated in major metro markets that provide opportunity for growth while disposing of lesser quality assets in more undesirable locations through this strategy the company has steadily progressed in its transformation of its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio the properties acquired are primarily located in major metro areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume the company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels rental rates and rental growth 

 

the company’s investment strategy also includes the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and acquired centers the company may selectively acquire established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in geographic regions in which the company presently operates additionally the company may selectively acquire land parcels in its key markets for real estate development projects for longterm investment the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise the company also continues to simplify its business by reducing the number of joint venture investments and pursuing redevelopment opportunities to increase overall value within its portfolio 

 

as part of the company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain properties if the company accepts sales prices for any of these assets that are less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material 

 

in order to execute the company ’s strategy the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on us openair shopping centers 

 

the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company ’s equity interest in such property 

 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

 

the company is focused on building a thriving and sustainable business one that succeeds by delivering longterm value for its stakeholders the company takes pride in how it conducts business including the positive contribution it makes to communities and its initiatives to safeguard the environment 

 

by investing in technologies and improved processes the company has delivered significant yearoveryear reductions in energy consumption across its portfolio o f properties rethinking how it controls and lights its parking areas significantly reduces operating costs and meaningfully curbs negative environmental impacts associated with fossilfuel based energy sources 

 

the company ’s responsibility efforts are not limited to promoting operational efficiency the company believes that sustainability leadership also requires an understanding of how environmental social and governance issues impact both its customers and the organization’s future growth prospects as a result it is taking steps to engage with its tenants on these issues and to better understand how the shopping centers it chooses to own and manage can grow in value by viewing them through this unique lens 

 

 

to focus the company ’s corporate responsibility efforts it has established a set of five strategic program priorities 

      

for the third consecutive year the company was named to the dow jones sustainability north america index remaining the sole us retail owner among eligible companies the company also earned the green star designation by the global real estate sustainability benchmark “gresb” for the fourth year in a row and remains the topranked north american company among a peer group of openair retail property owners

 

executive officers 

  

the following table sets forth information with respect to the executive officers of the company as of december 31 2017 

  

  

   




 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

 

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to 

 

               

 

     

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

 

n umerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

 

we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities 

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants  including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by  or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management ’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

 

 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

 

unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth results of operations and cash flows 

  

r eal estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for longterm investment and construction of retail andor mixeduse properties as opportunities arise we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks 

  

        

additionally new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management and the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return the foregoing risks could hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

construction and development projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

  

in the event that we decide to develop and construct new properties or redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us 

 

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as 

 

       

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

 

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected 

 

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including 

 

     

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset’s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

 

we intend to continue to sell our nonstrategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

 

there can be n o assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

 

our international operations have included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations 

 

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect our business cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations 

 

a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information resources more specifically a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations corrupt data or steal confidential information we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption particularly through a cyber incident including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

 

while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions such as payroll human resources electronic communications and certain finance functions our measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection firewalls backup servers threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach furthermore the security measures employed by thirdparty service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems 

 

the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption damage to our relationship with our tenants and private data exposure our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention 

 

a cyber incident could

 

         

moreover cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants including unauthorized access to customers ’ credit card data and other confidential information could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business 

 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relat ing to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 

 

 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

real estate properties are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage and could also cause delays in development projects negatively impact tenant demand for our properties and result in increased costs for future property insurance 

 

risks related to our debt and equity securities 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition   

 

w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

 

      

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

we are subject to f inancial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

 

our revolving credit facilit y and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

 

t he market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

 

        

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operatin g cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

 

 

risks related to our status as a reit and related us federal income tax matters 

 

loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in us federal income tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions  for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the us federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because 

 

     

moreover the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include 

 

        

many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses us federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities 

  

 

while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock 

 

o ur failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in us federal income tax laws including interpretations and regulations with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act and with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities 

 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions  and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock 

 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 

 

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys openair shopping centers are usually anchored by a grocery store national or regional discount department store or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot ahold delhaize bed bath  beyond albertsons ross stores petsmart kohl’s walmart and whole foods 

 

the company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2017 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 18 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 16 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2017 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot ahold delhaize bed bath  beyond and albertsons which represented 36 25 22 18 and 18 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

 

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for reimbursements by the tenant as part of common area maintenance 

 

minimum base rental revenue s and operating expense reimbursements accounted for 97 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for 3 of the companys total revenues from rental properties for the year ended december 31 2017 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 

 

as of december 31 2017 the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 594 million square feet of gla was 959 leased the consolidated operating portfolio consists entirely of properties located in the us inclusive of puerto rico for the period january 1 2017 to december 31 2017 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot which includes the impact of tenant concessions in its consolidated portfolio of openair shopping centers from 1499 to 1543 an increase of 044 this increase primarily consists of i a 030 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio ii a 013 increase relating to dispositions and iii a 001 increase relating to acquisitions 

 

the company has a total of 6089 leases in the us consolidated operating portfolio the following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years assuming no renewal options are exercised for purposes of the table the total annual base rent expiring represents annualized rental revenue excluding the impact of straightline rent for each lease that expires during the respective year amounts in thousands except for number of lease data 

 

  

  

during 2017 the company executed 1196 leases totaling over 89 million square feet in the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 451 new leases and 745 renewals and options the leasing costs associated with these leases are estimated to aggregate 757 million or 2858 per square foot these costs include 593 million of tenant improvements and 164 million of leasing commissions the average rent per square foot on new leases was 1883 and on renewals and options was 1586 the company will seek to obtain rents that are higher than amounts within its expiring leases however there are many variables and uncertainties which can significantly affect the leasing market at any time as such the company cannot guarantee that future leases will continue to be signed for rents that are equal to or higher than current amounts

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form 10k historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements including trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company its whollyowned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities these estimates are based on but not limited to historical results industry standards and current economic conditions giving due consideration to materiality the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable depreciable lives valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities valuation of joint venture investments and other investments realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could materially differ from these estimates 

 

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties investments in joint ventures marketable securities and other investments the company ’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments 

 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

 

base rental revenues from rental propert ies are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements in addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses 

 

the c ompany makes estimates of the collectabilityrecoverability of its accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rent expense reimbursements and other revenues the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 

 

real estate 

 

the company ’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized 

 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships where applicable assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date fair value is determined based on a market approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company elected to early adopt asu 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business at the beginning of its fiscal year ended december 31 2017 including its interim periods within the year and appropriately applied the guidance to its asset acquisitions of operating properties which included the capitalization of acquisition costs 

 

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows

 

  

 

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company ’s net earnings 

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance  changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

 

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management ’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment ’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

 

the company ’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt which may be guaranteed by the joint venture the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 

 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company ’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

 

the company ’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

 

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

 

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted

 

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance  which requires significant judgement from management should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance 

 

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company ’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

the company faces external factors which may influence its future results from operations the convenience and availability of ecommerce has continued to have an impact on the retail sector which could affect our ability to increase or maintain rental rates and our ability to renew expiring leases andor lease available space to mitigate the effect of ecommerce on its business the company’s strategy has been to attract local area customers to its properties by providing a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers including grocery stores national or regional discount department stores or drugstores which offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items in addition the company’s strategy includes investing capital into high quality assets which are concentrated in major metro markets allowing our tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume while also disposing of lesser quality assets in more undesirable locations for a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results performance or transactions see item 1a “risk factors” 

 

 

as the company moves forward it intends to take steps to strengthen its portfolio in the rapidly changing retail environment the company intends to continue to dispose of assets outside its core markets which will allow it to concentrate its presence in target coastal markets by completing development projects underway and continuing to invest in redevelopment ultimately producing a stronger portfolio for sustained longterm growth

funds f rom operations 

 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss available to the company ’s common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests plus ii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iii impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and iv after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 

 

the company presents ffo available to the company ’s common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo available to the company’s common shareholders when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo available to the company’s common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

 

the company also presents ffo available to the company ’s common shareholders as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo available to the company’s common shareholders excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

 

 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies ’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo available to the company’s common shareholders and ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

 

the company ’s reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to ffo available to the company’s common shareholders and ffo available to the company’s common shareholders as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 is as follows in thousands except per share data 

 

  

    

same property net operating income “ s ame property noi” 

 

same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies ’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity the company considers same property noi as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods it excludes properties under redevelopment development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

 

 

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees and amortization of abovebelow market rents less charges for bad debt operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company ’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating same property noi available to the company’s common shareholders may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

 

the following is a reconciliation of net income available to the company ’s common shareholders to same property noi in thousands 

 

  

same property noi increased by 27 million or 12 for the three months ended december 31 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 30 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and ii an increase in other property income of 09 million partially offset by iii an increase of 12 million of credit losses the percentage increase in same property noi for the three months ended december 31 2017 was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the impact of hurricane maria on the company ’s puerto rico properties 

 

same property noi increased by 149 million or 17 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in 2016 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 117 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio ii an increase in other property income of 18 million and iii a decrease of 14 million of credit losses the percentage increase in same property noi for the year ended december 31 2017 was negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to the impact of hurricane maria on the company ’s puerto rico properties 

 

effects of inflation 

 

many of the companys longterm leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases include escalation clauses or require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

operati n g and investment strategy 

 

the company’s strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of openair shopping centers through investments primarily in the us to achieve this strategy the company is i continuing to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger higher quality properties in key markets identified by the company for which substantial progress has been achieved as of the end of 2016 ii simplifying its business by a reducing the number of joint venture investments and b exiting mexico south america and canada for which the exit of south america has been completed mexico has been substantially completed and the company essentially sold all operating properties in canada iii pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value and iv selectively acquiring land parcels in our key markets for real estate development projects for longterm investment as part of the company’s strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use which may include residential and mixeduse components in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain us properties if the company accepts sales prices for any of these assets that are less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material in order to execute the company’s strategy the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on us openair shopping centers  

  

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in openair shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and us department of the treasury we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because 

  

      

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation changes in federal tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

  

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock    

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year including capital gains in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments these sources however may not be available on favorable terms or at all our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including the markets perception of our growth potential our current debt levels the market price of our common stock and our current and potential future earnings we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times or at all which may cause us to curtail our investment activities andor to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock 

    

 

 

  

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes 

  

a reits net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors 

  

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

  

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including but not limited to 

  

                 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

  

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by 

  

       

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

  

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

  

 

 

  

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

  

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

  

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

  

unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth results of operations and cash flows 

  

real estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for longterm investment and construction of retail andor mixed use properties as opportunities arise we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks 

  

        

 

 

  

additionally new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management and the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return the foregoing risks could cause the development of properties to hinder the company’s growth and have an adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flows 

  

construction and development projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion 

  

in the event that we decide to develop and construct new properties or redevelop existing properties we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development these risks include but are not limited to risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization risks related to construction labor disruptions adverse weather acts of god or shortages of materials which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our results of operations or financial condition 

  

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

  

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitment conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage andor resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us  

 

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as 

  

        

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above 

  

we intend to continue to sell our nonstrategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

 

 

 

we have completed or have nearly completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada however we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

our international operations have included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and foreign tax laws and regulations although we have completely or have nearly completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico south america and canada we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted or when or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations 

  

we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec’s investigation in the matter of walmart stores inc fw3678 that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa we have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the sec and the us department of justice “doj” which is conducting a parallel investigation at this point we are unable to predict the duration scope or result of the sec or doj investigations see “item 3 legal proceedings” below the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs any of these remedial measures if applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

  

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats there is no guarantee that the measures we employ to prevent detect and mitigate these threats will be successful in preventing a cyberattack cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition   

  

w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

  

       

 

 

  

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

  

our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

  

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

  

         

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

  

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans 

  

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected 

  

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including 

  

      

 

 

  

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the assets amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

  

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

the companys openair shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of 162618 square feet as of december 31 2016 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2016 the company expended 1435 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations 343 million 

  

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys openair shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store grocery store or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot ahold delhaize bed bath  beyond albertsons ross stores petsmart kohl’s walmart and whole foods 

  

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance 

  

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for 98 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for 2 of the companys total revenues from rental properties for the year ended december 31 2016 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth 

  

approximately 298 of the companys leases of consolidated properties also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental properties for the year ended december 31 2016 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 

 

as of december 31 2016 the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 592 million square feet of gla was 952 leased the consolidated operating portfolio consists entirely of properties located in the us inclusive of puerto rico for the period january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot which includes the impact of tenant concessions in its us consolidated portfolio of openair shopping centers from 1436 to 1499 an increase of 063 this increase primarily consists of i a 010 increase relating to acquisitions ii a 019 increase relating to dispositions and iii a 034 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio 

  

 

 

  

the company has a total of 6120 leases in the us consolidated operating portfolio the following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years assuming no renewal options are exercised for purposes of the table the total annual base rent expiring represents annualized rental revenue excluding the impact of straightline rent for each lease that expires during the respective year amounts in thousands except for number of lease data 

  

   

   

during 2016 the company executed 935 leases totaling over 68 million square feet in the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 344 new leases and 591 renewals and options the leasing costs associated with these leases are estimated to aggregate 584 million or 2981 per square foot these costs include 464 million of tenant improvements and 120 million of leasing commissions the average rent per square foot on new leases was 1885 and on renewals and options was 1497 the company will seek to obtain rents that are higher than amounts within its expiring leases however there are many variables and uncertainties which can significantly affect the leasing market at any time as such the company cannot guarantee that future leases will continue to be signed for rents that are equal to or higher than current amounts 

  

groundleased properties  the company has interests in 44 consolidated shopping center properties that are subject to longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company to construct andor operate a shopping center the company pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at the end of these longterm leases unless extended the land together with all improvements reverts to the landowner

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings 

  

 

 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

  

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

  

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk from time to time the joint ventures will obtain unsecured debt which may be guaranteed by the joint venture the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

  

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

  

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

  

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance 

  

 

 

  

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

funds f rom operations 

  

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests plus ii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iii impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and iv after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 

  

the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

 

 

  

the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company’s core operating performance the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

  

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to ffo and ffo as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 is as follows in thousands except per share data 

  

   

      

 

 

  

us same property net operating income “us same property noi” 

  

us same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity us same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company’s operations and management believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a measure of the company’s operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of us properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate us same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

  

us same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rent adjustments lease termination fees amortization of abovebelow market rents and includes charges for bad debt less operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of us same property noi from us unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the company’s method of calculating us same property noi may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the following is a reconciliation of the company’s income from continuing operations to us same property noi in thousands 

  

   

us same property noi increased by 61 million or 27 for the three months ended december 31 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 this increase is primarily the result of an increase of 45 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and an increase of 16 million in other property income net of property expenses 

  

us same property noi increased by 247 million or 28 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 this increase is primarily the result of an increase of 131 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and an increase of 116 million in other property income net of property expenses 

  

effects of inflation 

  

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

under gaap the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity the company may in the near term substantially liquidate its remaining investment in canada which will require the then unrealized gain on foreign currency translation to be recognized as earnings

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class i depositary shares class j depositary shares and class k depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimpri” “kimprj” and “kimprk” respectively 

  

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada puerto rico mexico chile brazil and peru however during 2013 based upon a perceived change in market conditions the company began its efforts to exit its investments in mexico and south america during 2015 the company began its efforts to exit its investments in canada by the fourth quarter of 2015 the company had substantially liquidated its investments in mexico and had completely exited south america by liquidating its investments in chile brazil and peru the company’s revenues and equity in income including gains on sales and impairment losses from its foreign investments in us dollar equivalents and their respective local currencies are as follows in millions 

  

   

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has previously engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including igroundup development of openair shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii the company’s investment in ab acquisition llc which consists of grocers safeway albertsons vons and other banners collectively “albertsons” the company may consider other investments through its trs should suitable opportunities arise 

  

 

 

 

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

  

operati n g and investment strategy 

  

the company’s strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of openair shopping centers through investments primarily in the us to achieve this strategy the company is i continuing to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger higher quality properties in key markets identified by the company ii simplifying its business by a reducing the number of joint venture investments and b exiting mexico south america and canada for which the exit of south america has been completed and mexico has been substantially completed iii pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value and iv selectively acquiring land parcels for groundup development projects consisting of retail andor mixed use centers for longterm investment in addition the company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support the company has an active capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain us properties if the company accepts sales prices for any of these assets that are less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material in order to execute the company’s strategy the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on us openair shopping centers 

  

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in openair shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise 

  

the companys openair shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and are typically anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate 

  

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2015 no single openair shopping center accounted for more than 18 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 15 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2015 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot bed bath  beyond royal ahold and albertsons which represented 32 24 21 19 and 19 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

  

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of openair shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following 

  

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust or changes in federal tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to real estate investment trusts could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

  

 

 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because 

  

      

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit or changes in federal tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

  

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

  

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 

  

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

  

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

  

         

 

 

 

         

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

  

our properties consist primarily of openair shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by 

  

       

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants including anchor tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

  

at any time our tenants particularly small local stores may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

  

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants including anchor tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

  

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need 

  

 

 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

  

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

 

unsuccessful groundup development activities or a slowdown in groundup development activities could have a direct impact on our growth results of operations and cash flows 

  

property groundup development is a component of our operating and investment strategy we intend to continue pursuing select groundup development opportunities for longterm investment and construction of retail andor mixed use properties as opportunities arise we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached our groundup development and construction activities include the following risks 

  

        

additionally new groundup development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management and the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return the foregoing risks could cause the development of properties to hinder the company’s growth and have an adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flows 

  

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

  

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

  

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us 

  

in addition joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks such as 

  

        

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above 

  

 

 

 

we intend to continue to sell our nonstrategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

we have certain international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

  

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to 

  

            

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

in order to operate internationally we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote an appropriate level of resources to managing our international operations 

  

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

our international operations included properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies anticorruption laws or other legal requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec’s investigation in the matter of walmart stores inc fw3678 that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa we are cooperating with the sec investigation and a parallel investigation by the us department of justice “doj” see “item 3 legal proceedings” below the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs any of these remedial measures if applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

 

 

 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

  

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats there is no guarantee that the measures we employ to prevent detect and mitigate these threats will be successful in preventing a cyberattack cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition   

  

w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit andor equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

  

       

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

  

our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

  

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

  

         

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

  

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

 

 

 

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of 

  

       

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

  

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans 

  

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely where that occurs the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected 

  

the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses including 

  

      

a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment “otti” against such assets when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date we assess whether the decline is temporary or otherthantemporary if we intend to sell an impaired asset or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the assets amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date when an otti is recognized through earnings a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

  

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

the companys openair shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of 158686 square feet as of december 31 2015 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2015 the company capitalized 1560 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations 385 million 

  

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys openair shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot bed bath  beyond royal ahold albertsons walmart kohl’s petsmart and ross stores 

  

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance 

  

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for 98 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for 2 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2015 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth 

  

approximately 311 of the companys leases of consolidated properties also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2015 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 

  

as of december 31 2015 the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 605 million square feet of gla was 957 leased the consolidated operating portfolio consists entirely of properties located in the us inclusive of puerto rico for the period january 1 2015 to december 31 2015 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot which includes the impact of tenant concessions in its us consolidated portfolio of openair shopping centers from 1350 to 1436 an increase of 086 this increase primarily consists of i a 024 increase relating to acquisitions ii a 040 increase relating to dispositions and iii a 022 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio 

  

the company has a total of 6164 leases in the us consolidated operating portfolio the following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years assuming no renewal options are exercised for purposes of the table the total annual base rent expiring represents annualized rental revenue excluding the impact of straightline rent for each lease that expires during the respective year amounts in thousands except for number of lease data 

 

   

1 leases currently under month to month lease or in process of renewal 

  

 

 

 

during 2015 the company executed 1016 leases totaling over 65 million square feet in the company’s consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 388 new leases and 628 renewals and options the leasing costs associated with these leases are estimated to aggregate 542 million or 2538 per square foot these costs include 428 million of tenant improvements and 114 million of leasing commissions the average rent per square foot on new leases was 1763 and on renewals and options was 1576 the company will seek to obtain rents that are higher than amounts within its expiring leases however there are many variables and uncertainties which can significantly affect the leasing market at any time as such the company cannot guarantee that future leases will continue to be signed for rents that are equal to or higher than current amounts 

  

groundleased properties  the company has interests in 46 consolidated shopping center properties and interests in 20 shopping center properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that are subject to longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company or an affiliated joint venture to construct andor operate a shopping center the company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at the end of these longterm leases unless extended the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties investments in joint ventures marketable securities and other investments the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments andor valuation allowances

real estate 

  

the company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized 

  

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships where applicable assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments if material are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

  

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 

  

   

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

  

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

  

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in openair shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

 

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

  

 

 

 

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

  

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 

  

the company believes when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit’s qualification under the code by permitting within certain limits the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate as such the reit controls which and when investments are held in or distributed or sold from its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single consolidated corporate taxpayer 

  

the company primarily utilizes a projection of pretax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome any negative evidence although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection based upon the company’s analysis of positive and negative evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if future income projections do not occur as forecasted the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance in addition the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs and sale of certain builtin gain assets 

  

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

funds f rom operations 

  

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests plus ii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iii impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and iv after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 

  

the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

 

 

 

the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company’s core operating performance the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

  

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to ffo and ffo as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 is as follows in thousands except per share data 

  

   

     

 

 

 

combined s ame property net operating income “combined same property noi” 

  

combined same property noi is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity combined same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company’s operations and management believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a measure of the company’s operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate combined same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

  

combined same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rents lease termination fees abovebelow market rents and includes charges for bad debt less operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements plus the company’s proportionate share of combined same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements is determined by using the current period exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods 

  

additionally the company presents us same property noi which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s canadian operations from combined same property noi the company provides us same property noi because it believes such measure is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a valuable measure of periodtoperiod us operating performance 

  

the company’s method of calculating combined same property noi and us same property noi may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the following is a reconciliation of the company’s income from continuing operations to combined same property noi and us same property noi in thousands 

  

   

us same property noi and combined same property noi increased by 62 million or 28 and 57 million or 25 respectively for the three months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 these increases are primarily the result of an increase of 49 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and an increase of 08 million in other property income 

  

us same property noi and combined same property noi increased by 267 million or 31 and 259 million or 29 respectively for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 these increases are primarily the result of an increase of 246 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and an increase of 13 million in other property income 

  

effects of inflation 

  

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class h depositary shares class i depositary shares class j depositary shares and class k depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimprh” “kimpri” “kimprj” and “kimprk” respectively 

  

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico chile brazil and peru however during 2013 based upon a perceived change in market conditions the company began its efforts to exit its investments in mexico and south america by the fourth quarter of 2014 the company had substantially liquidated its investments in mexico brazil and peru the company’s revenues and equity in income including gains on sales and impairment losses from its foreign investments in us dollar equivalents and their respective local currencies are as follows in millions 

  

   

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has previously engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion and ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers the company may consider other investments through its trs should suitable opportunities arise 

  

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

  

 

 

  

operati n g and investment strategy 

  

the company’s strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments primarily in the us to achieve this strategy the company is i striving to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger higher quality properties in key markets identified by the company ii simplifying its business by exiting mexico and south america and reducing the number of joint venture investments and iii pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value and certain development opportunities for longterm investment the company has an active capital recycling program and during the second quarter of 2014 the company implemented a plan to accelerate the disposition of certain us properties this plan effectively shortened the company’s anticipated hold period for these properties and as such caused the company to recognize impairment charges on certain consolidated operating properties to reflect their estimated fair values if the company accepts sales prices for these assets that are less than their net carrying values the company would be required to take additional impairment charges in order to execute the company’s strategy the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers the company also has an institutional management business with domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers in an effort to further its simplification strategy the company is actively pursuing opportunities to reduce its institutional management business through partner buyouts property acquisitions from institutional joint ventures andor third party property sales 

  

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise 

  

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and are typically anchored by a supermarket a discount department store a home improvement center or a drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate 

  

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2014 no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 18 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 14 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2014 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot walmart kohl’s and bed bath  beyond which represented 33 24 18 18 and 18 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

  

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties   

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following 

  

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust or changes in federal tax laws regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to real estate investment trusts could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

  

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

 

 

 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because 

  

      

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit or changes in federal tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

  

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

  

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 

  

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

  

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

  

                 

 

 

  

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

  

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by 

  

       

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

  

at any time our tenants particularly small local stores may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

  

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

  

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need   

 

 

 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or groundup development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

  

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

  

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

  

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

  

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us 

  

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures implicate additional risks such as 

  

        

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above   

 

 

 

  

we intend to continue to sell our nonstrategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

  

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to 

  

            

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

currency fluctuations between local currency and the us dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cumulative translation adjustment “cta” which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company’s cta balance the company’s aggregate cta net gain balance at december 31 2014 is 03 million this amount consists of unrealized gains in canada aggregating 152 million offset by unrealized losses in chile aggregating 149 million 

  

under us gaap the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity during 2013 the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and during the fourth quarter 2014 the company substantially liquidated its investment in mexico and peru and recognized a loss from foreign currency translation in the amount of 1401 million before noncontrolling interest of 58 million the company may in the near term substantially liquidate its investment in chile which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings 

  

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote an appropriate level of resources to managing our international operations 

  

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

our international operations include properties in canada mexico and chile and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions   

 

 

 

  

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies anticorruption laws or other legal requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec’s investigation in the matter of walmart stores inc fw3678 that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa we are cooperating with the sec investigation and a parallel investigation by the us department of justice “doj” see “item 3 legal proceedings” below the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs any of these remedial measures if applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

  

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection backup servers and annual penetration testing there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition   

  

w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

  

       

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

  

our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility term loan and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

  

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

  

           

 

 

  

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

  

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities mortgage receivables or other investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of 

  

       

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

  

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include tjx companies the home depot walmart kohl’s bed bath  beyond royal ahold petsmart ross stores best buy and safeway 

  

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance 

  

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for 98 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for 2 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2014 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth 

  

approximately 312 of the companys leases of consolidated properties also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2014 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices

groundleased properties  the company has interests in 49 consolidated shopping center properties and interests in 24 shopping center properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that are subject to longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company or an affiliated joint venture to construct andor operate a shopping center the company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at the end of these longterm leases unless extended the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties investments in joint ventures marketable securities and other investments the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments andor valuation allowances 

  

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

  

base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements in addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses 

  

the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rent expense reimbursements and other revenues the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 

  

real estate 

  

the company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized 

  

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships where applicable assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments if material are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

  

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 

  

   

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

  

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

  

 

 

  

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a limited selective basis obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

  

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

  

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

  

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 

  

the company believes when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit’s qualification under the code by permitting within certain limits the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate as such the reit controls which and when investments are held in or distributed or sold from its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single consolidated corporate taxpayer 

  

the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pretax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome any negative evidence although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection based upon the company’s analysis of positive and negative evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if future income projections do not occur as forecasted the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance in addition the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs sale of certain builtin gain assets and reducing intercompany debt 

  

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

funds from operations 

  

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and ii extraordinary items plus iii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iv impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 

  

the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company’s core operating performance the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

  

 

 

  

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to ffo and ffo as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 is as follows in thousands except per share data 

  

   

   

combined same property net operating income 

  

combined same property net operating income “combined same property noi” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity combined same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company’s operations and management believes that it is helpful to investors as a measure of the company’s operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate as such combined same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

  

 

 

  

combined same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rents lease termination fees abovebelow market rents and includes charges for bad debt less operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of combined same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis our method of calculating combined same property noi may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

the following is a reconciliation of the company’s income from continuing operations to combined same property noi and us same property net operating income “us same property noi” in thousands 

  

   

combined same property noi before foreign currency impact increased by 89 million or 40 for the three months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 combined same property noi increased by 70 million or 31 for the three months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 66 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and ii an increase of 23 million in other property income partially offset by iii the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 19 million 

  

combined same property noi before foreign currency impact increased by 294 million or 33 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 combined same property noi increased by 227 million or 25 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 258 million related to leaseup and rent commencements in the portfolio and ii an increase of 36 million in other property income partially offset by iii the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 67 million 

  

effects of inflation 

  

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

the company’s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk the following table presents the company’s aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31 2014 with corresponding weightedaverage interest rates sorted by maturity date the table does not include extension options where available amounts include fair value purchase price allocation adjustments for assumed debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents which is the company’s reporting currency the instruments’ actual cash flows are denominated in us dollars canadian dollars cad and chilean pesos clp as indicated by geographic description usd equivalent in millions 

  

   

based on the company’s variablerate debt balances interest expense would have increased by 58 million in 2014 if shortterm interest rates were 10 higher 

  

the following table presents the company’s foreign investments and respective cumulative translation adjustment “cta” as of december 31 2014 investment amounts are shown in their respective local currencies and the us dollar equivalents and cta balances are shown in us dollars 

  

   

the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated but not eliminated through the use of local currency denominated debt the company has not and does not plan to enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

currency fluctuations between local currency and the us dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cta which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company’s cta balance the company’s aggregate cta net gain balance at december 31 2014 is 03 million 

  

 

 

  

under us gaap the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity during 2013 the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio during the year ended december 31 2014 the company continued selling properties in its latin american portfolio and as a result substantially liquidated its investments in mexico and peru due to the substantial liquidation of its investments in mexico and peru the company recognized a loss from foreign currency translation in the aggregate amount of 1344 million after noncontrolling interest of 58 million

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class h depositary shares class i depositary shares class j depositary shares and class k depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimprh” “kimpri” “kimprj” and “kimprk” respectively 

  

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico chile brazil and peru however during 2013 based upon a perceived change in market conditions the company began its efforts to exit its investments in mexico and south america the company’s revenues and equity in income including gains on sales and impairment losses from its foreign investments in us dollar equivalents and their respective local currencies are as follows in millions 

  

   

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has been engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion and ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers the company may consider other investments through its trs should suitable opportunities arise 

  

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

  

 

 

  

operating and investment strategy 

  

the company’s strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments primarily in the us and canada to achieve this strategy the company is i striving to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger higher quality properties in key markets identified by the company ii simplifying its business by exiting mexico south america and reducing the number of joint venture investments and iii pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value this strategy entailed a shift away from nonretail assets these investments included nonretail preferred equity investments marketable securities mortgages on nonretail properties and several urban mixeduse properties as of december 31 2013 the company had substantially completed the sale of these nonretail assets the company also has an active capital recycling program of selling retail assets deemed nonstrategic and properties within the company’s latin american portfolio in order to execute the company’s strategy the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers the company also has an institutional management business with domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers in an effort to further its simplification strategy the company is actively pursuing opportunities to reduce its institutional management business through partner buyouts property acquisitions from institutional joint ventures andor third party property sales 

  

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise 

  

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and are typically anchored by a discount department store a supermarket or a drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate 

  

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2013 no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 17 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 13 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2013 the company’s five largest tenants were tjx companies the home depot walmart bed bath  beyond and kohl’s which represented 30 28 23 18 and 17 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

  

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following 

  

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

  

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  

 

 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because 

  

      

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

  

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

  

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 

  

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

  

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

  

                 

 

 

  

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

  

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by 

  

       

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

  

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

  

at any time our tenants particularly small local stores may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

  

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

  

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

  

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need 

  

  

 

 

  

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

  

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

  

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

  

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

  

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us 

  

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures implicate additional risks such as 

  

        

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above 

  

we intend to continue to sell our nonretail and nonstrategic assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonretail andor nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

  

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to 

  

            

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

currency fluctuations between local currency and the us dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cumulative translation adjustment “cta” which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company’s cta balance the company’s aggregate cta net loss balance at december 31 2013 is 910 million based on the company’s foreign investment balances at december 31 2013 a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 922 million whereas an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 754 million 

  

under us gaap the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity during 2013 the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and the company may in the near term substantially liquidate all of its investments in this portfolio which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings at december 31 2013 the aggregate cta net loss balance relating to the company’s latin american portfolio is 1147 million based on the company’s foreign investment balances in latin americas at december 31 2013 a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 482 million whereas an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 394 million 

  

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations 

  

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

our international operations include properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

  

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies anticorruption laws or other legal requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec’s investigation in the matter of walmart stores inc fw3678 that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa we are cooperating with the sec investigation and a parallel investigation by the us department of justice “doj” see “item 3 legal proceedings” below the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs any of these remedial measures if applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

  

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection backup servers and annual penetration testing there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations 

  

 

 

  

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition   

  

w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

  

       

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

  

our revolving credit facility term loans and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility term loans and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

  

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

  

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

  

         

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

  

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

 

 

  

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us   

  

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of 

  

       

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

  

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans 

  

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

  

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties investments in joint ventures marketable securities and other investments the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments andor valuation allowances 

  

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

  

base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements in addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses 

  

the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rent expense reimbursements and other revenues the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 

  

real estate 

  

the company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized 

  

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships where applicable assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

  

 

 

  

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 

  

   

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

  

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

  

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a limited selective basis obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 

  

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

  

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates 

  

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

  

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

  

 

 

  

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 

  

the company believes when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit’s qualification under the code by permitting within certain limits the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate as such the reit controls which and when investments are held in or distributed or sold from its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single consolidated corporate taxpayer 

  

the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pretax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome any negative evidence although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection based upon the company’s analysis of negative and positive evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if future income projections do not occur as forecasted the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance in addition the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs sale of certain builtin gain assets and reducing intercompany debt 

  

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

funds from operations 

  

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and ii extraordinary items plus iii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iv impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 

 

the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company’s core operating performance the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

  

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits 

  

 

 

  

the company’s reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to ffo and ffo as adjusted for the three months and years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 is as follows in thousands except per share data 

  

   

   

same property net operating income 

  

same property net operating income “same property noi” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company’s operations and management believes that it is helpful to investors as a measure of the company’s operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate two years for latin american properties as such same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

  

 

 

  

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rents lease termination fees abovebelow market rents and includes charges for bad debt less operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis our method of calculating same property noi may differ from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits the following is a reconciliation of the company’s income from continuing operations to same property noi in thousands 

  

   

same property noi increased by 77 million or 34 for the three months ended december 31 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 60 million related to leaseup and rent commencements and ii an increase of 32 million in other property and ancillary income partially offset by iii the negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 15 million 

  

same property noi increased by 316 million or 35 for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 this increase is primarily the result of i an increase of 259 million related to leaseup and rent commencements and ii an increase of 82 million in other property and ancillary income partially offset by iii the negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 25 million 

  

effects of inflation 

  

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate risk the following table presents the company’s aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31 2013 with corresponding weightedaverage interest rates sorted by maturity date the table does not include extension options where available amounts include fair value purchase price allocation adjustments for assumed debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents which is the company’s reporting currency the instruments’ actual cash flows are denominated in us dollars canadian dollars cad mexican pesos mxn and chilean pesos clp as indicated by geographic description usd equivalent in millions 

  

   

  

based on the company’s variablerate debt balances interest expense would have increased by 74 million in 2013 if shortterm interest rates were 10 higher 

  

the following table presents the company’s foreign investments and respective cumulative translation adjustment “cta” as of december 31 2013 investment amounts are shown in their respective local currencies and the us dollar equivalents and cta balances are shown in us dollars 

  

   

the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated but not eliminated through the use of local currency denominated debt the company has not and does not plan to enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

 

 

  

cta results from currency fluctuations between local currency and the us dollar during the period in which the company held its investment and is recorded as a component of aoci on the company’s consolidated balance sheets the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company’s cta balance based on the company’s foreign investment balances at december 31 2013 a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 922 million whereas an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 754 million 

 

under us gaap the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity during 2013 the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and the company may in the near term substantially liquidate all of its investments in this portfolio which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings at december 31 2013 the aggregate cta net loss balance relating to the company’s latin american portfolio is 1147 million based on the company’s foreign investment balances in latin americas at december 31 2013 a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 482 million whereas an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10 would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately 394 million

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class h depositary shares class i depositary shares class j depositary shares and class k depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimprh” “kimpri” “kimprj” and “kimprk” respectively 

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees and promoted interests based on value creation the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico chile brazil and peru the company’s revenues and equity in income from its foreign investments in us dollar equivalents and their respective local currencies are as follows in millions 

 

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has been engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with taxdeferred exchange transactions the company may consider other investments through its trs should suitable opportunities arise 

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

operating and investment strategy 

the company’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments in north america this vision has entailed a shift away from nonretail assets that the company currently holds these investments include nonretail preferred equity investments marketable securities mortgages on nonretail properties and several urban mixeduse properties the company has been actively selling its nonretail assets and investments as of december 31 2012 these investments had a book value of 3984 million which represents less than 35 of the company’s total assets before depreciation in addition the company has an active capital recycling program of selling retail assets deemed nonstrategic  the company also has an institutional management business with domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers 

 

  

  

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise 

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and are typically anchored by a discount department store a supermarket or a drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate 

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2012 no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 17 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 12 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2012 the company’s five largest tenants were the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings and bed bath  beyond which represented 30 29 26 20 and 17 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest 

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties 




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following 

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders   for each of the years involved because 

 

 

 

 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties 

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent 

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

at any time our tenants particularly small local stores may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases 

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from other activities acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

newly acquired or redeveloped properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties particularly in secondary markets also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

 

  

  

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us 

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures implicate additional risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above 

we intend to sell many of our nonretail and nonstrategic assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonretail andor nonstrategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations 

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

our international operations include properties in canada mexico chile brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies anticorruption laws or other legal requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec’s investigation in the matter of walmart stores inc fw3678 that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa see “item 3 legal proceedings” below the us department of justice and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs any of these remedial measures if applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats including password protection backup servers and annual penetration testing there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities 

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us 

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans 

 

  

  

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected 

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

 item 2 properties 

real estate portfolio as of december 31 2012 the company had interests in 896 shopping center properties the “combined shopping center portfolio” aggregating 1313 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” and 829 other property interests primarily through the company’s preferred equity investments other real estate investments and nonretail properties totaling 266 million square feet of gla for a grand total of 1725 properties aggregating 1579 million square feet of gla located in 44 states puerto rico canada mexico and south america the company’s portfolio includes noncontrolling interests neighborhood and community shopping centers comprise the primary focus of the companys current portfolio as of december 31 2012 the company’s combined shopping center portfolio was 940 leased 

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of 138518 square feet as of december 31 2012 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2012 the company capitalized 78 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations 254 million 

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings bed bath  beyond royal ahold kohl’s best buy petsmart and costco 

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties 

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for 97 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for 3 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2012 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth 

approximately 154 of the companys leases of consolidated properties also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2012 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 

 

  

  

as of december 31 2012 the company’s consolidated operating portfolio was 934 leased and was comprised of 589 million square feet of gla of which 551 million related to properties held in the us and 38 million related to properties located in latin america for the period january 1 2012 to december 31 2012 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot which includes the impact of tenant concessions in its us consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers from 1148 to 1218 an increase of 070 this increase primarily consists of i a 016 increase relating to acquisitions as well as development properties placed into service ii a 024 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio and iii a 030 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various joint venture entities for the period january 1 2012 to december 31 2012 the company’s average base rent per leased square foot in its mexican consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers decreased from 966 to 922 a decrease of 044 this decrease is primarily due to higher vacancy levels at certain development sites placed into service which were included in occupancy in 2012 and new leases signed net of leases vacated and renewals within the portfolio 

the company has a total of 5027 leases in the us consolidated operating portfolio of which 682 leases comprising 37 million square feet of gla are scheduled to expire within the next 12 months assuming available extension options are not exercised these expiring leases have an average base rent per square foot of 1399 the average rent per square foot on new us leases signed during 2012 was 1641 the company will seek to obtain rents that are higher than these expiring leases however there are many variables and uncertainties which can significantly affect the leasing market at any time as such the company cannot guarantee that future leases will continue to be signed for rents that are equal to or higher than current amounts 

groundleased properties  the company has interests in 47 consolidated shopping center properties and interests in 20 shopping center properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that are subject to longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company or an affiliated joint venture to construct andor operate a shopping center the company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at the end of these longterm leases unless extended the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements in addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses 

the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rent expense reimbursements and other revenues the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims the company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 

real estate 

the company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized 

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

 

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 

 

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and unleveraged of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 

 

  

  

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a limited selective basis obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 

the company believes when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit’s qualification under the code by permitting within certain limits the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate as such the reit controls which and when investments are held in or distributed or sold from its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single consolidated corporate taxpayer 

the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pretax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome any negative evidence although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection based upon the company’s analysis of negative and positive evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if future income projections do not occur as forecasted the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance in addition the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs sale of certain builtin gain assets and reducing intercompany debt 

the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see footnote 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” excluding i gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and ii extraordinary items plus iii depreciation and amortization of operating properties and iv impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and v after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 

the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits many of which present ffo when reporting results comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company’s core operating performance the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio 

ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and accordingly may not be comparable to such other reits

same property net operating income 

same property net operating income “same property noi” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company’s operations and management believes that it is helpful to investors as a measure of the company’s operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization as such same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the companys properties 

same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties excluding straightline rents lease termination fees and abovebelow market rents less operating and maintenance expense real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures calculated on the same basis same property noi includes all properties that are owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and properties pending stabilization properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of i reaching 90 leased or ii one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate two years for latin american properties

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

market and economic conditions real estate and retail shopping sector 

in the us economic and market conditions have improved credit conditions have continued to allow increased access and availability to secured mortgage debt and the unsecured bond and equity markets however there remains concern over high unemployment rates in the us and concerns over uncertain economic conditions in europe these conditions have contributed to slow growth in the us and international economies 

historically real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants the company’s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants who generally offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items in addition the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic composition and tenant base 

 

  

  

the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability which may include straightline rents deferred lease costs tenant improvements tenant inducements and intangible assets 

the retail shopping sector overall has continued to steadily improve during 2012 however select markets which experienced rapid expansion prior to the economic recession such as nevada arizona and select portions of california are experiencing slower growth if growth in the retail shopping sector does not continue the company may experience tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 

1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class f depositary shares class g depositary shares and class h depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimprf” “kimprg” and “kimprh” respectively

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees and promoted interests based on value creation the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico chile brazil and peru the company’s revenues and equity in income from its foreign investments are as follows in millions

 

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has been engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with taxdeferred exchange transactions the company may consider other investments through taxable reit subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

operating and investment strategy 

the company’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments in north america this vision will entail a shift away from nonretail assets that the company currently holds these investments include nonretail preferred equity investments marketable securities mortgages on nonretail properties and several urban mixeduse properties the company’s plan is to sell certain nonretail assets and investments as of december 31 2011 these investments had a book value of approximately 512 million which represents less than 54 of the company’s total assets in addition the company continues to be committed to broadening its institutional management business by forming joint ventures with high quality domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and typically are anchored by a discount department store a supermarket or a drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity 

investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2011 no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 16 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 12 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2011 the company’s five largest tenants were the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings and kohl’s which represented approximately 30 29 25 21 and 17 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 

·

unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified and

·

we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including

·

changes in the national regional and local economic climate

·

local conditions including an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for space in properties like those that we own

·

trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes

·

the attractiveness of our properties to tenants

·

the ability of tenants to pay rent particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations

·

tenants who may declare bankruptcy andor close stores 

·

competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants

·

changes in market rental rates

·

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair renovate and relet space

·

changes in operating costs including costs for maintenance insurance and real estate taxes

·

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties and

·

changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage zoning the environment and taxes

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by

·

weakness in the national regional and local economies 

·

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies 

·

the impact of internet sales on the demand for reatil space

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector and

·

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets 

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing or home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties or iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

at any time our tenants’ particularly small local stores may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our performance

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code restricts a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested in some properties as a coventurer or partner instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties the coventurer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures implicate additional risks such as

·

potentially inferior financial capacity diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner’s continued cooperation 

·

our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree

·

our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture

·

our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources

·

our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity and

·

our joint venture partners’ business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

we intend to sell many of our nonretail assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonretail properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us 

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to

·

currency risks including currency fluctuations

·

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements

·

potential adverse tax burdens

·

burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws

·

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash

·

regional national and local political uncertainty

·

economic slowdown andor downturn in foreign markets

·

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

·

difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures and

·

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

our international operations are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business such as

·

we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties which would materially adversely affect our business strategy

·

our liquidity could be adversely affected

·

we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness

·

we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness or

·

we may need to issue additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us

·

the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours

·

the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies

·

our financial condition and performance

·

the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends

·

an increase in market interest rates which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares and

·

general economic and financial market conditions

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us 

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

·

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market

·

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates

·

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer

·

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations and

·

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

real estate portfolio as of december 31 2011 the company had interests in 946 shopping center properties the “combined shopping center portfolio” aggregating 1381 million square feet of gross leasable area “gla” and 845 other property interests primarily through the company’s preferred equity investments other real estate investments and nonretail properties totaling approximately 341 million square feet of gla for a grand total of 1791 properties aggregating 1722 million square feet of gla located in 44 states puerto rico canada mexico and south america the company’s portfolio includes noncontrolling interests neighborhood and community shopping centers comprise the primary focus of the companys current portfolio as of december 31 2011 the company’s combined shopping center portfolio was approximately 933 leased

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 138000 square feet as of december 31 2011 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2011 the company capitalized approximately 114 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 258 million

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings kohl’s best buy royal ahold costco and bed bath  beyond

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 97 and other revenues including percentage rents accounted for approximately 3 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2011 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

approximately 163 of the companys leases of consolidated properties also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2011 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases the company’s leases may also include escalation clauses which provide for increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices

as of december 31 2011 the company’s consolidated portfolio was approximately 925 leased and was comprised of approximately 615 million square feet of gla of which approximately 586 million related to properties held in the us and 27 million related to properties located in mexico for the period january 1 2011 to december 31 2011 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot in its us consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers from 1120 to 1148 an increase of 028 this increase primarily consists of i a 009 increase relating to acquisitions as well as development properties placed into service ii a 012 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio and iii a 007 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various joint venture entities for the period january 1 2011 to december 31 2011 the company’s average base rent per leased square foot in its mexican consolidated portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers decreased from 1203 to 966 a decrease of 237 this decrease is primarily due to a weaker mexican peso during the period average exchange rate mexican pesos to us dollar was 1362 at december 31 2011 versus 1240 at january 1 2011 the placement of development sites into occupancy in 2011 and new leases signed net of leases vacated and renewals within the portfolio

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners

groundleased properties  the company has interests in 48 consolidated shopping center properties and interests in 21 shopping center properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that are subject to longterm ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company or an affiliated joint venture to construct andor operate a shopping center the company or the joint venture pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at the end of these longterm leases unless extended the land together with all improvements revert to the landowner

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the

company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation in march 2006 the company was added to the s  p 500 index an index containing the stock of 500 large 

cap companies most of which are us corporations the companys common stock class f depositary shares class g depositary shares and class h depositary shares are traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the trading symbols “kim” “kimprf” “kimprg” and “kimprh” respectively

the company’s initial growth resulted primarily from groundup development and the construction of shopping centers subsequently the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its expansion across the nation the company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees and promoted interests based on value creation the company continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico chile brazil and peru the company’s revenues and equity in income from its foreign investments are as follows in millions

 

the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” as permitted by the tax relief extension act of 1999 has been engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion ii retail real estate management and disposition services which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with taxdeferred exchange transactions the company may consider other investments through taxable reit subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise

in addition the company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and from time to time provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets 

operating and investment strategy 

the company’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments in north america this vision will entail a shift away from nonretail assets that the company currently holds these investments include nonretail preferred equity investments marketable securities mortgages on nonretail properties and several urban mixeduse properties the company’s plan is to sell certain nonretail assets and investments in addition the company continues to be committed to broadening its institutional management business by forming joint ventures with high quality domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers

the companys investment objective is to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth through i the retail retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed to attract local area customers and typically are anchored by a discount department store a supermarket or a drugstore tenant offering daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items the company may either purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships joint ventures or similar types of coownership equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing andor other indebtedness financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the company’s equity interest in such property the company may make loans to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2010 no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 08 of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest or more than 10 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2010 the company’s five largest tenants were the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings and best buy which represented approximately 30 28 24 23 and 16 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the company’s properties




 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements the failure of a subsidiary reit to fail to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 

·

unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified and

·

we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our securities 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year excluding capital gains and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties 

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including

·

changes in the national regional and local economic climate

·

local conditions including an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for space in properties like those that we own

·

the attractiveness of our properties to tenants

·

the ability of tenants to pay rent particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations

·

tenants who may declare bankruptcy andor close stores 

·

competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants

·

changes in market rental rates

·

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair renovate and relet space

·

changes in operating costs including costs for maintenance insurance and real estate taxes

·

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties and

·

changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage zoning the environment and taxes

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties 

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by

·

weakness in the national regional and local economies 

·

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies 

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector and

·

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets 

in addition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition new regional malls openair lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers ecommerce outlet malls discount shopping clubs catalog companies direct mail telemarketing and home shopping networks all of which could i reduce rents payable to us ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties and iii lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties we may fail to anticipate the effects on our properties of changes in consumer buying practices particularly of sales over the internet and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants’ businesses which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants our tenants’ financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties 

at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our performance

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms 

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management’s time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs 

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities

these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued 

we have invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or 

otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties including the risk of the coventurer or partner failing to provide capital and fulfilling its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures have additional risks such as

·

potentially inferior financial capacity diverging business goals and strategies and our need for the venture partner’s continued cooperation 

·

our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree

·

our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture

·

our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or view them less favorably as collateral which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources

·

our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity and

·

our joint venture partners’ business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

we intend to sell many of our nonretail assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments which may result in significant losses to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our nonretail properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us 

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business 

the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to

·

currency risks including currency fluctuations

·

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements

·

potential adverse tax burdens

·

burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws

·

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash

·

regional national and local political uncertainty

·

economic slowdown andor downturn in foreign markets

·

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

·

difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures and

·

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we can predict neither the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions 

our international operations are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business such as

·

we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties which would materially adversely affect our business strategy

·

our liquidity could be adversely affected

·

we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness

·

we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness and

·

we may need to issue additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 

our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us

·

the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us

·

the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies

·

our financial condition and performance

·

the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends

·

an increase in market interest rates which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares and

·

general economic and financial market conditions

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock under irs guidance up to 90 of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future we currently do not intend to do so in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes as a result taxable us stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend including the portion paid in shares of common stock in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividend including all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future 

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings operating cash flows liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us 

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

·

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market

·

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates

·

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer

·

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations and

·

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

we may be subject to liability under environmental laws ordinances and regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 137000 square feet as of december 31 2010 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties this includes renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2010 the company capitalized approximately 144 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 253 million

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies walmart sears holdings kohl’s costco best buy and royal ahold

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 202 of the companys leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2010 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have provisions requiring contractual rent increases as well as escalation clauses such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2010 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a limited selective basis obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable any estimated debt premiums capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 

marketable securities 

the company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as availableforsale in accordance with the fasb’s investmentsdebt and equity securities guidance these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “oci” gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method 

all debt securities are generally classified as heldtomaturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are stated at amortized cost adjusted for any amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as availableforsale these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of oci

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company’s marketable securities may be impaired a marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security 

realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain nonus investments the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years 

future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 

the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset

the company believes when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit’s qualification under the code by permitting within certain limits the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate as such the reit controls which and when investments are held in or distributed or sold from its taxable reit subsidiaries this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single consolidated corporate taxpayer 

the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pretax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome its significant negative evidence of a threeyear cumulative pretax book loss although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection based upon the company’s analysis of negative and positive evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if future income projections do not occur as forecasted the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance in addition the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs sale of certain builtin gain assets and further reducing intercompany debt see note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the company recognizes and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company’s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made which could have a material impact on operating results see note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

market and economic conditions real estate and retail shopping sector 

in the us economic and market conditions have stabilized credit conditions have continued to improve from the prior year with increased access and availability to secured mortgage debt and the unsecured bond and equity markets however there remains concern over high unemployment rates and an uncertain economic recovery in europe these conditions have contributed to slow growth in the us and international economies

historically real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants the company’s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants who generally offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items in addition the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base

the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability which may include straightline rents deferred lease costs tenant improvements tenant inducements and intangible assets

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions particularly in the western united states primarily california these conditions may result in the company’s tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust 

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 

·

unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified and

·

we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions 

adverse global market and economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties

recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market inflation energy costs geopolitical issues and declining real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses maintain our properties pay dividends and refinance debt

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy and close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants lease terminations by certain tenants or a failure by certain tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in which case we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease

we are unable to predict whether or to what extent or for how long these adverse market and economic conditions will persist the continuation andor intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses maintain properties pay dividends and refinance debt

during 2009 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of approximately 1751 million before income taxes and noncontrolling interest relating to adjustments to property carrying values investments in real estate joint ventures real estate under development and other real estate investments ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future 

ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility will likely continue to make it difficult to value the properties and investments owned by us and our unconsolidated joint ventures there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation or in the stability of the value of such properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof in addition we intend to sell many of our noncore assets over the next several years no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion which could materially and adversely affect us 

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including

·

changes in the national regional and local economic climate

·

local conditions including an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for space in properties like those that we own

·

the attractiveness of our properties to tenants

·

the ability of tenants to pay rent

·

competition from other available properties

·

changes in market rental rates

·

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair renovate and relet space

·

changes in operating costs including costs for maintenance insurance and real estate taxes

·

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties and

·

changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage zoning the environment and taxes

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by

·

weakness in the national regional and local economies 

·

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies 

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector

·

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and

·

increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet 

failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our performance

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold if at all

risks related to our acquisition development operation and sale of real property 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties

these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

we face competition in leasing or developing properties  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities

risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued

we have invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives these investments involve risks and uncertainties including the risk of the coventurer or partner failing to provide capital and fulfill its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our jointventure partners these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk joint ventures have additional risks such as

·

potentially inferior financial capacity diverging business goals and strategies and our need for the venture partner continued cooperation 

·

our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree

·

our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture

·

our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or view them less favorably as collateral which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources

·

our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity and

·

our joint venture partners’ business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments

we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments which may result in significant losses to us

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

risks related to our international operations 

we have significant international operations which may be affected by economic political and other risks associated with international operations and this could adversely affect our business

we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to

·

currency risks including currency fluctuations

·

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements

·

potential adverse tax burdens

·

burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws

·

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash

·

regional national and local political uncertainty

·

economic slowdown andor downturn in foreign markets

·

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

·

difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures and

·

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

in order to fully develop our international operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations

our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations any of these factors could however materially adversely affect our international operations and consequently our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our international operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations and we can predict neither the impact of associated requirements to which our international operations may be subject nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions

our international operations are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted

we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa or other legal requirements failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal regulatory or other sanctions which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

risks related to our financing activities 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition

the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business such as

·

we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties which would materially adversely affect our business strategy

·

our liquidity could be adversely affected

·

we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness

·

we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness and

·

we may need to issue additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders

financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities

our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us

·

the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us

·

the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies

·

our financial condition and performance

·

the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends

·

an increase in market interest rates which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares and

·

general economic and financial market conditions

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future

we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock under recent irs guidance up to 90 of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 312012 could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future we currently have no intent to do so in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock taxable us stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend including the portion paid in shares of common stock in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividend including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock

the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness and preferred stock the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables 

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

·

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market

·

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates

·

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer

·

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations and

·

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 

the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

we invest in mortgage receivables our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

risks related to environmental regulations 

we may be subject to environmental regulations

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 140000 square feet as of december 31 2009 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties 

these projects usually include renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2009 the company capitalized approximately 92 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 203 million

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies sears holdings walmart kohl’s costco best buy and royal ahold

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 209 of the companys leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2009 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have built in contractual rent increases as well as escalation clauses such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 98 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2009 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners

retail store leases in addition to neighborhood and community shopping centers as of december 31 2009 the company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 15 million square feet of anchor stores in 16 neighborhood and community shopping centers located in 11 states as of december 31 2009 approximately 926 of the space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores under net lease agreements providing for average annualized

executive summary 

kimco realty corporation is one of the nation’s largest publiclytraded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers as of december 31 2009 the company had interests in 1915 properties totaling approximately 1769 million square feet of gla located in 45 states puerto rico canada mexico chile brazil and peru

the company is selfadministered and selfmanaged through present management which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 50 years the executive officers are engaged in the daytoday management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company with nearly all operating functions including leasing asset management maintenance construction legal finance and accounting administered by the company

the company’s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of retail shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through equity investments in north america this vision will entail a shift away from certain nonstrategic assets that the company currently holds these investments include nonretail preferred equity investments marketable securities mortgages on nonretail properties and several urban mixeduse properties the company’s plan is to sell certain nonstrategic assets and investments the company realizes that the sale of these assets will be over a period of time given the current unfavorable market conditions in order to execute the company’s vision the company’s strategy is to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers in addition the company continues to be dedicated to building its institutional management business by forming joint ventures with high quality domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers

the company continually evaluates its debt maturities and based on management’s current assessment believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results although the credit environment remains volatile the company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial us and global banks select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks the company has noticed a trend that the approval process from mortgage lenders has slowed while pricing and loantovalue ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms in general spreads are higher and loantovalues are lower but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements during the second half of 2009 the unsecured public debt markets became accessible for certain reits and the company successfully issued 3000 million 6875 10year unsecured senior notes moreover the company continues to assess 2010 and beyond to ensure the company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues 

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions these conditions have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance 

the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will most likely continue throughout 2010 which may curtail the company’s growth in the near term

during 2009 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of approximately 1751 million before income taxes and noncontrolling interest relating to adjustments to property carrying values investments in real estate joint ventures real estate under development and other real estate investments ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company its whollyowned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities these estimates are based on but not limited to historical results industry standards and current economic conditions giving due consideration to materiality the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable depreciable lives valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities valuation of joint venture investments marketable securities and other investments and realizability of deferred tax assets application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could materially differ from these estimates

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties investments in joint ventures marketable securities and other investments the company’s reported net earnings is directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments andor valuation allowances

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements in addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses 

the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents expense reimbursements and other revenues the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims the company’s reported net earnings is directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable

real estate 

the company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized

upon acquisition of real estate operating properties the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities fair value is determined based on an exit price approach which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date if up to one year from the acquisition date information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows

 

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net earnings

real estate under development on the company’s consolidated balance sheets represents groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which may be subsequently sold upon completion or which the company may hold as longterm investments these assets are carried at cost the cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity a gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of the fasb’s real estate sales guidance

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence but does not control these entities these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and where applicable are based upon an allocation of the investment’s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a selective basis obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired an investment’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 

marketable securities 

the company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as availableforsale in accordance with the fasb’s investmentsdebt and equity securities guidance these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “oci” gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method 

all debt securities are generally classified as heldtomaturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldto–maturity securities are stated at amortized cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as availableforsale

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company’s marketable securities may be impaired a marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be otherthantemporary to the extent impairment has occurred the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security 

realizability of deferred tax assets 

the company is subject to federal state and local income taxes on the income from its trs activities which include kimco realty services krs a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and the consolidated entities of fnc realty corporation “fnc” and blue ridge real estate companybig boulder corporation “blue ridge”

the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted

a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the evidence available it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance is needed information about an enterprises current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years sometimes however historical information may not be as relevant for example if there has been a significant recent change in circumstances and special attention is required

future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law the following four possible sources of taxable income may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards these include i future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ii future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards iii taxable income in prior carrybackyears if carry back is permitted under the relevant tax law and iv taxplanning strategies that would if necessary be implemented

evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and possibly from year to year to the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary other sources need not be considered consideration of each source is required however to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets

the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset

as of december 31 2009 the company had net deferred tax assets of approximately 863 million this net deferred tax asset includes approximately 120 million for the tax effect of net operating losses “nol” after the impact of a valuation allowance of 338 million relating to fnc a consolidated entity in which the company has a 53 ownership interest the partial valuation allowance on the fnc deferred tax asset primarily results from current projected taxable income being more likely than not insufficient to utilize the full amount of the deferred tax asset the company’s remaining net deferred tax asset of approximately 743 million primarily relates to krs and consists of i 138 million in deferred tax liabilities ii 98 million in nol carryforwards that expire in 2029 iii 63 million in tax credit carryforwards 40 million of which expire in 2029 and 23 million that do not expire and iv 720 million primarily relating to differences in gaap book basis and tax basis of accounting for i real estate assets ii real estate joint ventures iii other real estate investments and iv asset impairments charges that have been recorded for book purposes but not yet recognized for tax purposes and v other miscellaneous deductible temporary differences 

as of december 31 2009 the company determined that no valuation allowance was needed against the 743 million net deferred tax asset within krs this determination was based upon the companys analysis of both positive evidence which includes future projected income for krs and negative evidence which consists of a three year cumulative pretax book loss of approximately 230 million for krs the cumulative loss was primarily the result of significant impairment charges taken by krs during 2009 and 2008 of approximately 917 million and approximately 822 million respectively krs has a strong earnings history exclusive of the impairment charges since 2001 krs has produced substantial taxable income in each year through 2008 over the prior three years 2006 through 2008 krs generated approximately 693 million of taxable income before net operating loss carryovers

to determine future projected income the company scheduled krs’s pretax book income and taxable income over a twenty year period taking into account its continuing operations “core earnings” core earnings consist of estimated net operating income for properties currently in service and generating rental income from existing tenants major lease turnover is not expected in these properties as these properties were generally constructed and leased within the past two years to allow the forecast to remain objective and verifiable no income growth was forecasted for any other aspect of krs’s continuing business activities including its investment in the albertson’s joint venture the company also included future known events in its projected income forecast such as the maturity of certain mortgages and construction loans which will significantly reduce the amount of interest expense incurred in future years additionally the company has also committed to certain actions which will result in reducing leverage at krs with the company’s change in its merchant building strategy future business operations at krs will not support its current capital structure which consists of approximately 564 million of intercompany loans the company has made to krs to fund its merchant building operation krs incurred approximately 321 million of interest expense related to the intercompany financing during 2009 the company will recapitalize a significant portion of the debt to reflect krs’s ongoing business activities the twenty year taxable income estimate reduces intercompany interest in accordance with this plan

the company’s projection of krs’s future taxable income utilizing the assumptions above with respect to core earnings and reductions in interest expense due to debt maturities and the company’s recapitalization plans generates approximately 2052 million in future taxable income which is sufficient to fully utilize krs’s 743 million net deferred tax asset as a result of this analysis the company has determined it is more likely than not that krs’s net deferred tax asset of 743 million will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance is needed at december 31 2009 if future income projections do not occur as forecasted or the company incurs additional impairment losses the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance

other real estate investments 

the company maintains a preferred equity program which provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties the company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting as of december 31 2009 the company’s net investment under the preferred equity program was approximately 4184 million relating to 213 properties as of december 31 2009 these preferred equity investment properties had individual nonrecourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately 16 billion due to the company’s preferred position in these investments the company’s share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows the company’s maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital

additionally during july 2007 the company invested approximately 817 million of preferred equity capital in a portfolio comprised of 403 net leased properties which are divided into 30 master leased pools with each pool leased to individual corporate operators these properties consist of a diverse array of freestanding restaurants fast food restaurants convenience and auto parts stores as of december 31 2009 these properties were encumbered by third party loans aggregating approximately 4185 million with interest rates ranging from 508 to 1047 with a weighted average interest rate of 93 and maturities ranging from two years to 13 years 

during june 2002 the company acquired a 90 equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties the properties are leased under a longterm bondtype net lease whose primary term expires in 2016 with the lessee having certain renewal option rights the company’s cash equity investment was approximately 40 million this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with the fasb’s lease guidance the net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals estimated unguaranteed residual value unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the investment

as of december 31 2009 18 of these leveraged lease properties were sold whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately 312 million as of december 31 2009 the remaining 12 properties were encumbered by thirdparty nonrecourse debt of approximately 384 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease as an equity participant in the leveraged lease the company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease accordingly this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease

effects of inflation 

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the 

consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

market and economic conditions real estate and retail shopping sector 

in the us market and economic conditions have remained challenging although credit conditions have improved from the prior year they remain volatile during 2009 continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market and fluctuations in the real estate markets have contributed to continued market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy these conditions combined with low levels of business and consumer confidence and high unemployment have contributed to volatility and little to no growth in the us and international economies

historically real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants the company’s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants who generally offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items in addition the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base

the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability which may include straightline rents deferred lease costs tenant improvements tenant inducements and intangible assets

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions particularly in the western united states primarily california these conditions may result in the company’s tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance 

the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout 2010 which will curtail the company’s growth in the near term

history 

the company began operations through its predecessor the kimco corporation which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders in 1973 these principals formed the company as a delaware corporation and in 1985 the operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 elected to qualify as a reit in accordance with sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in 1994 the company reorganized as a maryland corporation

the companys growth through its first 15 years resulted primarily from the groundup development and construction of its shopping centers by 1981 the company had assembled a portfolio of 77 properties that provided an established source of income and positioned the company for an expansion of its asset base at that time the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and creating value through the redevelopment and retenanting of those properties as a result of this strategy a majority of the operating shopping centers added to the company’s portfolio since 1981 have been through the acquisition of existing shopping centers

during 1998 the company through a merger transaction completed the acquisition of the price reit inc a maryland corporation the price reit prior to the merger price reit was a selfadministered and selfmanaged equity reit that was primarily focused on the acquisition development management and redevelopment of large retail community shopping center properties concentrated in the western part of the united states in connection with the merger the company acquired interests in 43 properties located in 17 states with the completion of the price reit merger the company expanded its presence in certain western states including arizona california and washington in addition price reit had strong groundup development capabilities these development capabilities coupled with the company’s own construction management expertise provide the company the ability to pursue groundup development opportunities on a selective basis

also during 1998 the company formed kimco income reit kir an entity in which the company held a 9999 limited partnership interest kir was established for the purpose of investing in highquality properties financed primarily with individual nonrecourse mortgages the company believed that these properties were appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the company traditionally used at the time of formation the company contributed 19 properties to kir each encumbered by an individual nonrecourse mortgage during 1999 kir sold a significant interest in the partnership to institutional investors thus establishing the company’s investment management program the company holds a 450 noncontrolling limited partnership interest in kir and accounts for its investment in kir under the equity method of accounting see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

the company has expanded its investment management program through the establishment of other various institutional joint venture programs in which the company has noncontrolling interests ranging generally from 5 to 45 the company’s largest joint venture kimco prudential joint venture kimpru was formed in 2006 in connection with the pan pacific retail properties inc pan pacific merger transaction with prudential real estate investors prei which holds approximately 34 billion in undepreciated real estate assets at book value the company earns management fees acquisition fees disposition fees and promoted interests based on value creation see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

in connection with the tax relief extension act of 1999 the rma which became effective january 1 2001 the company is permitted to participate in activities from which it was previously precluded in order to maintain its qualification as a reit so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code subject to certain limitations as such the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including i merchant building through its whollyowned taxable reit subsidiaries which are primarily engaged in the groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and subsequent sale thereof upon completion see recent developments  groundup development ii retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies for real estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with taxdeferred exchange transactions the company will consider other investments through taxable reit subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise

the company has continued its geographic expansion with investments in canada mexico puerto rico chile brazil and peru during october 2001 the company formed the riocan venture riocan venture with riocan real estate investment trust riocan canada’s largest publicly traded reit measured by gla in which the company has a 50 noncontrolling interest to acquire retail properties and development projects in canada the company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting the company has expanded its presence in canada with the establishment of other joint venture arrangements during 2002 the company along with various strategic coinvestment partners began acquiring operating and development properties located in mexico during 2006 the company acquired interests in shopping center properties located in puerto rico through joint ventures in which the company holds controlling ownership interests during 2007 the company acquired an interest in four shopping center properties located in chile through a joint venture in which the company holds a noncontrolling ownership interest during 2008 the company acquired interests in two shopping center properties in brazil through a joint venture in which the company holds a controlling ownership interest and a land parcel for groundup development located in peru through a joint venture in which the company holds a controlling interest see notes 3 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

investment and operating strategy 

the companys investment objective has been to increase cash flow current income and consequently the value of its existing portfolio of properties and to seek continued growth through i the strategic retenanting renovation and expansion of its existing centers and ii the selective acquisition of established incomeproducing real estate properties and properties requiring significant retenanting and redevelopment primarily in neighborhood and community shopping centers in geographic regions in which the company presently operates the company has and will continue to consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise

while the company has historically held its properties for longterm investment and accordingly has placed strong emphasis on its ongoing program of regular maintenance periodic renovation and capital improvement it is possible that properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part as circumstances warrant subject to reit qualification rules

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base as of december 31 2008 the companys single largest neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 10 of the companys annualized base rental revenues and only 09 of the company’s total shopping center gla at december 31 2008 the company’s five largest tenants were the home depot tjx companies sears holdings kohl’s and walmart which represent approximately 33 28 25 22 and 18 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest

in connection with the rma which became effective january 1 2001 the company has expanded its investment and operating strategy to include new real estaterelated opportunities which the company was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a reit as such the company established a merchant building business through its wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries which make selective acquisitions of land parcels for the groundup development primarily of neighborhood and community shopping centers and subsequent sale thereof upon completion additionally the company has developed a business which specializes in providing capital real estate advisory services and disposition services of real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed andor bankrupt retailers these services may include assistance with inventory and fixture liquidation in connection with goingoutofbusiness sales the company may participate with other entities in providing these advisory services through partnerships joint ventures or other coownership arrangements the company as part of its investment strategy will selectively seek investments for its taxable reit subsidiaries as suitable opportunities arise

historically real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to certain business and legal risks including but not limited to the following

risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust 

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities

we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit

·

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 

·

unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified and

·

we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities 

risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions 

recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions through the end of 2008 these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses maintain properties pay dividends and refinance debt

the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including

·

changes in the national regional and local economic climate

·

local conditions including an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for space in properties like those that we own

·

the attractiveness of our properties to tenants

·

the ability of tenants to pay rent

·

competition from other available properties

·

changes in market rental rates

·

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair renovate and relet space

·

changes in operating costs including costs for maintenance insurance and real estate taxes

·

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties and

·

changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage zoning the environment and taxes

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy and close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space in the future the market for retail space could be adversely affected by

·

weakness in the national regional and local economies 

·

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies 

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector

·

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and

·

increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet 

failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants’ leases in the event of a default by a tenant we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases

in addition multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could have a material adverse effect on our performance

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds if at all

risks related to our acquisition development operation and sale of real property 

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties

these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

we face competition in leasing or developing properties  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities

risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments 

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued

we have invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives if the coventurer or partner defaults on their obligations we may be required to fulfill their obligation ourselves the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments which may result in significant losses to us

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

risks related to our international operations 

we have significant international operations that carry additional risks

we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to

·

currency risks including currency fluctuations

·

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements

·

potential adverse tax burdens

·

burdens of complying with different permitting standards labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws

·

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash

·

regional national and local political uncertainty

·

economic slowdown andor downturn in foreign markets

·

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and

·

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

risks related to our financing activities 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition

the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business such as

·

we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties which would materially adversely affect our business strategy

·

our liquidity could be adversely affected

·

we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness

·

we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness and

·

we may need to issue additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders

financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities

our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities

risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities 

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

our financial condition and performance

·

the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends

an increase in market interest rates which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares and

·

general economic and financial market conditions

risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables 

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in significant losses to us

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in significant losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

·

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market

·

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates

·

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer

·

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations and

·

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 

the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt which may result in significant losses to us

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

we invest in mortgage receivables our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

risks related to environmental regulations 

we may be subject to environmental regulations

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies sears holdings kohl’s walmart royal ahold best buy bed bath and beyond and costco

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 228 of the companys leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2008 additionally a majority of the company’s leases have builtin contractual rent increases as well as escalation clauses such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices

executive summary 

kimco realty corporation is one of the nation’s largest publiclytraded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers as of december 31 2008 the company had interests in 1950 properties totaling approximately 1822 million square feet of gla located in 45 states puerto rico canada mexico chile brazil and peru 

the company is selfadministered and selfmanaged through present management which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 50 years the executive officers are engaged in the daytoday management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company with nearly all operating functions including leasing asset management maintenance construction legal finance and accounting administered by the company

in connection with the tax relief extension act of 1999 the rma which became effective january 1 2001 the company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust reit so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code subject to certain limitations as such the company through its taxable reit subsidiaries is engaged in various retail real estaterelated opportunities including i merchant building through its wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries which are primarily engaged in the groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion ii retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed andor bankrupt retailers and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions the company will consider other investments through taxable reit subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise

in addition the company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support for those properties the company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers the company has made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment was in management’s judgment priced below the value of the underlying assets however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets

the company’s strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers

the company continually evaluates its debt maturities and based on management’s current assessment believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results although the credit environment has become much more constrained since the third quarter of 2008 the company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial us and global banks select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks the company has noticed a trend that the approval process from lenders has slowed while pricing and loantovalue ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms in general spreads are higher and loantovalues are lower but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements moreover the company continues to assess 2009 and beyond to ensure the company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues 

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions these conditions have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance 

the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout 2009 which will curtail the company’s growth in the near term

depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows

 

the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties these assessments have a direct impact on the company’s net income

on a continuous basis management assesses whether there are any indicators including property operating performance and general market conditions that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is considered impaired only if management’s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

when a real estate asset is identified by management as heldforsale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs if in management’s opinion the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

the company’s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of coinvestments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties consistent with its core business these joint ventures typically obtain nonrecourse thirdparty financing on their property investments thus contractually limiting the company’s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment and due to the lender’s exposure to losses a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk the company’s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments the company on a selective basis obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make

the company’s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 

marketable securities

effects of inflation 

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

global market and economic conditions real estate and retail shopping sector 

in the us recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth throughout 2008 for the year ended december 31 2008 continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market inflation energy costs geopolitical issues and declining equity and real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy in the third quarter added concerns fueled by the federal government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc the us government provided loans to american 

international group inc and other federal government interventions in the us credit markets led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets these conditions combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and has led to the unprecedented deterioration of the us and international equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008

historically real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company’s ability to attract or retain tenants the company’s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants which generally offer daytoday necessities rather than highpriced luxury items in addition the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base 

the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability which may include straightline rents deferred lease costs tenant improvements tenant inducements and intangible assets

the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions these conditions may result in our tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers in some cases to declare bankruptcy andor close stores certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection however any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company’s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company’s overall performance 

the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout 2009 which will curtail the company’s growth in the near term

the ability of tenants to pay rent

·

competition from other available properties

·

changes in market rental rates

·

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair renovate and relet space

·

changes in operating costs including costs for maintenance insurance and real estate taxes

·

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties and

·

changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage zoning the environment and taxes

downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance

our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties our performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally the market for retail space could in the future be adversely affected by

·

weakness in the national regional and local economies 

·

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies 

·

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector

·

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and

·

increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet 

failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance

our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants at any time our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases in addition lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event we may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could impact our performance

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy

a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages as a result it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds if at all

we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms

real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that it has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks

there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties

these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected

we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued

we have invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly in these investments we do not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt

we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments which may result in losses to us

our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above

we have significant international operations that carry additional risks

we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states the risks we face in international business operations include but are not limited to

·

currency risks including currency fluctuations

·

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements

·

potential adverse tax burdens

·

burdens of complying with different permitting standards labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws

·

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash

·

regional national and local political uncertainty

·

economic slowdown andor downturn in foreign markets

·

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and

·

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market which may have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy our results of operations and our financial condition 

market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business such as

·

we could have difficulty acquiring or developing properties which could materially adversely affect our business strategy

·

our liquidity could be adversely affected

·

we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness

·

we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness and

·

we may need to issue additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders

financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities

our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of our indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on us

we may be subject to environmental regulations

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances

we face competition in leasing or developing properties  

we face competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment some of these competitors have greater financial resources than us this results in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities

changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following

·

the extent of institutional investor interest in us

·

the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us

·

the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies

·

our financial condition and performance

·

the market’s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends

·

an increase in market interest rates which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares and

·

general economic and financial market conditions

we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables which may result in losses to us

our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer which may result in losses to us marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer as a result investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of

·

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market

·

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates

·

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer

·

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations and

·

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn 

these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments 

we invest in mortgage receivables our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns furthermore in the event of default the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans

our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics or materialmens liens or property tax liens in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely in these cases the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment resulting in a loss in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties which are generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 140000 square feet as of december 31 2007 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties these projects usually include renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2007 the company capitalized approximately 91 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 197 million

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies sears holdings kohl’s walmart best buy linens n things royal ahold bed bath and beyond and costco

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixedbase rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 243 of the companys leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for less than 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2007

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2007 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners

retail store leases in addition to neighborhood and community shopping centers as of december 31 2007 the company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 18 million square feet of anchor stores in 19 neighborhood and community shopping centers located in 13 states as of december 31 2007 approximately 974 of the space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores under net lease agreements providing for average annualized base rental payments of 409 per square foot the average annualized base rental payments under the company’s retail store leases to the landowners of such subleased stores are approximately 254 per square foot the average remaining primary term of the retail store leases and similarly the remaining primary term of the sublease agreements with the tenants currently leasing such space is approximately two years excluding options to renew the leases for terms which generally range from five years to 20 years the company’s investment in retail store leases is included in the caption other real estate investments on the company’s consolidated balance sheets

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are the material risks associated with the purchase and ownership of the company’s equity and debt securities as an owner of real estate the company is subject to certain business risks arising in connection with the underlying real estate including among other factors the following 

i loss of the company’s tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of its securities 

the company elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 1992 the company currently intends to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believes that the company’s current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify as a reit 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control may affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of the company’s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and the company must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of the company’s assets also the company must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of the company’s net taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although the company believes that it is organized and has operated in such a manner the company can give no assurance that it has qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

if the company loses its reit status it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to company stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit 

 

in addition if the company fails to qualify as a reit it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value 

of the company’s securities 

ii adverse market conditions and competition may impede the company’s ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties 

the economic performance and value of the company’s properties are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

 

iii downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on the company’s performance 

the company’s properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties the company’s performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by weakness in the national regional and local economies the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space 

iv failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to the company because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact the company’s performance 

the company’s performance depends on its ability to collect rent from tenants at any time the company’s tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result the company’s tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases in addition lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event the company may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could impact the company’s performance 

v the company may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy 

the company cannot give assurance that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of the company’s tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by the company to collect pre 

bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the company receives an order permitting it to do so from the bankruptcy court a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay the company’s efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to the company in full however if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy the company would have only a general unsecured claim for damages any unsecured claim the company holds may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws which limit the amount of the claim the company can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that the company will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds 

vi real estate property investments are illiquid and therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms 

real estate property investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore the company may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms 

vii we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks 

we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies we may not however succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget in addition we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs when we do pursue a project or acquisition we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated furthermore our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition in addition development of our existing properties presents similar risks 

viii there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties 

these properties may not have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management as we acquire additional properties we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties including leaseup and tenant retention in addition our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties also newly acquired properties may not perform as expected 

ix the company does not have exclusive control over its joint venture investments so the company is unable to ensure that its objectives will be pursued 

the company has invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned ownership structure in these investments the company does not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s interests or goals take action contrary to the company’s interests or otherwise impede the company’s objectives the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

x we have significant international operations that carry additional risks 

we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states the inherent risks that we face in international business operations include but are not limited to 

 

each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds which ultimately could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

xi the company’s financial covenants may restrict its operating and acquisition activities 

the company’s revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which the company’s senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the company’s ability to incur secured and unsecured debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of the company’s assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict the company’s ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of the company’s indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on the company 

xii the company may be subject to environmental regulations 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations the company may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in the company’s property as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not the company knew about or was responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 

xiii the company’s ability to lease or develop properties is subject to competitive pressures  

the company faces competition in the acquisition development operation and sale of real property from individuals and businesses who own real estate fiduciary accounts and plans and other entities engaged in real estate investment some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company does this results in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in the company’s existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities 

xiv changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of the company’s publicly traded securities 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of the company’s publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions which may change from timetotime among the market conditions that may affect the market price of the company’s publicly traded securities are the following

the company’s neighborhood and community shopping center properties generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 131000 square feet as of january 1 2007 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties these projects usually include renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2006 the company capitalized approximately 84 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 146 million 

the company’s neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually “anchored” by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the company’s shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies sears holdings kohl’s walmart value city linens n things burlington coat royal ahold and costco 

a substantial portion of the company’s income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the company’s standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the company’s management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties 

approximately 1960 of the company’s 8260 leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for approximately 1 of the company’s revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2006 

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99 of the company’s total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2006 the company’s management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the company’s existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth 

for the period january 1 2006 to december 31 2006 the company increased the average base rent per leased square foot in its portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers from 944 to 1019 an increase of 075 this increase primarily consists of i a 040 increase relating to acquisitions ii a 005 increase relating to dispositions or the transfer of properties to various joint venture entities iii a 002 increase related to the fluctuation in exchange rates related to canadian and mexicandenominated leases and iv a 028 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated and rent stepups within the portfolio 

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through geographic and tenant diversity no single neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for more than 08 of the company’s total shopping center gla or more than 16 of total annualized base rental revenues as of december 31 2006 the company’s five largest tenants at december 31 2006 were the home depot tjx companies sears holdings kohl’s and walmart which represent approximately 35 29 25 22 and 21 respectively of the company’s annualized base rental revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest the company maintains an active leasing and capital improvement program that combined with the high quality of the locations has made in management’s opinion the company’s properties attractive to tenants 

the company’s management believes its experience in the real estate industry and its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of property owners 

retail store leases in addition to neighborhood and community shopping centers as of january 1 2007 the company had interests in retail store leases totaling approximately 18 million square feet of anchor stores in 20 neighborhood and community shopping centers located in 14 states as of january 1 2007 approximately 998 of the space in these anchor stores had been sublet to retailers that lease the stores under net lease agreements providing for average annualized base rental payments of 402 per square foot the average annualized base rental payments under the company’s retail store leases to the landowners of such subleased stores are approximately 241 per square foot the average remaining primary term of the retail store leases and similarly the remaining primary term of the sublease agreements with the tenants currently leasing such space is approximately three years excluding options to renew the leases for terms which generally range from 5 years to 20 years the company’s investment in retail store leases is included in the caption other real estate investments on the company’s consolidated balance sheets

inflation and other business issues many of the company’s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds “percentage rents” which generally increase as prices rise andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases such escalation clauses include increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the company’s leases are

for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon renewal to market rates most of the company’s leases require tenants to reimburse the company for their allocable share of operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and insurance thereby reducing the company’s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates its exposure to shortterm interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and will from timetotime enter into interest rate protection agreements and foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates

qualification as a reit the company has elected commencing with its taxable year which began january 1 1992 to qualify as a reit under the code if as the company believes it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a reit under the code the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its reit taxable income as defined under the code 

  

in connection with the rma which became effective january 1 2001 the company is now permitted to participate in activities which the company was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a reit so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code subject to certain limitations the primary activities conducted by the company in its taxable reit subsidiaries during 2005 included but were not limited to i the groundup development of shopping center properties and subsequent sale thereof upon completion see recent developments – groundup developments ii real estate advisory and disposition services and iii acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions as such the company was subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities 

  

risk factors set forth below are the material risks associated with the purchase and ownership of the company’s equity and debt securities as an owner of real estate the company is subject to certain business risks arising in connection with the underlying real estate including among other factors including the following 

  

i loss of the company’s tax status as a real estate investment trust would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of its securities 

  

the company elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code commencing with our taxable year beginning january 1 1992 the company currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that the company’s current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify as a reit 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control may affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of the company’s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and the company must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of the company’s assets also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of the company’s net taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative 

  

back to contents 

  

interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although the company believes that it is organized and has operated in such a manner the company can give no assurance that it has qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

  

if the company loses its reit status it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payment of principal and interest on the debt securities the company issues and to pay dividends to company stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit 

  

 

  

in addition if the company fails to qualify as a reit it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

  

as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of the company’s securities 

  

ii adverse market conditions and competition may impede the company’s ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties 

  

the economic performance and value of the company’s properties are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including 

  

 

  

iii downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on the company’s performance 

  

the company’s properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties the company’s performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by weakness in the national regional and local economies the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet to the extent that any of these conditions occur they are likely to impact market rents for retail space 

  

back to contents 

  

iv failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to the compnay because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact the company’s performance 

  

the company’s performance depends on its ability to collect rent from tenants at any time the company’s tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition as a result the company’s tenants may delay a number of lease commencements decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration fail to make rental payments when due close stores or declare bankruptcy any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenant’s leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases in addition lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases in that event the company may be unable to release the vacated space at attractive rents or at all the occurrence of any of the situations described above particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations could impact the company’s performance 

  

v the company may be unable to collect balances due from any tenants in bankruptcy 

  

the company cannot give assurance that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay rent a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of the company’s tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by the company to collect prebankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor or their property unless the company receives an order permitting it to do so from the bankruptcy court a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay the company’s efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all prebankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to the company in full however if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy the company would have only a general unsecured claim for damages any unsecured claim the company holds may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws which limit the amount of the claim the company can make if a lease is rejected as a result it is likely that the company will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds 

  

vi real estate property investments are illiquid and therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms 

  

real estate property investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly in addition the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit’s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies therefore the company may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms 

  

vii the company does not have exclusive control over its joint venture investments so the company is unable to ensure that its objectives will be pursued 

  

the company has invested in some cases as a coventurer or partner in properties instead of owning directly these investments involve risks not present in a whollyowned ownership structure in these investments the company does not have exclusive control over the development financing leasing management and other aspects of these investments as a result the coventurer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s interests or goals take action contrary to the company’s interests or otherwise impede the company’s objectives the coventurer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt 

  

viii the company’s financial covenants may restrict its operating and acquisition activities 

  

the company’s revolving credit facilities and the indenture under which the company’s senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the company’s ability to incur secured and unsecured debt make dividend payments sell all or substantially all of the company’s assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions these covenants may restrict the company’s ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions in addition failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under andor accelerate some or all of the company’s indebtedness which would have a material adverse effect on the company

the company’s neighborhood and community shopping center properties generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 142000 square feet as of january 1 2006 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties these projects usually include renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2005 the company capitalized approximately 68 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 189 million

a substantial portion of the company’s income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99 of the company’s total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2005 the company’s management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the company’s existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties generally owned and operated through subsidiaries or joint ventures had an average size of approximately 147000 square feet as of january 1 2005 the company generally retains its shopping centers for longterm investment and consequently pursues a program of regular physical maintenance together with major renovations and refurbishing to preserve and increase the value of its properties these projects usually include renovating existing facades installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot lighting during 2004 the company capitalized approximately 51 million in connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations approximately 175 million 

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include the home depot tjx companies kohl’s kmart corporation walmart best buy royal ahold costco bed bath  beyond and toys r us 

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties 

approximately 1889 of the companys 7352 leases also contain provisions requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants’ gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for approximately 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2004 

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 99 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the year ended december 31 2004 the companys management believes that the base rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

operations of the kimco corporation were merged into the company the company
completed its initial public stock offering the ipo in november 1991 and

the companys growth through its first 15 years resulted primarily from the
groundup development and construction of its shopping centers by 1981 the
company had assembled a portfolio of 77 properties that provided an established
source of income and positioned the company for an expansion of its asset base
at that time the company revised its growth strategy to focus on the
acquisition of existing shopping centers and creating value through the
redevelopment and retenanting of those properties as a result of this
strategy substantially all of the operating shopping centers added to the
companys portfolio since 1981 have been through the acquisition of existing
shopping centers

during 1998 the company through a merger transaction completed the
acquisition of the price reit inc a maryland corporation the price reit
prior to the merger price reit was a selfadministered and selfmanaged equity
reit that was primarily focused on the acquisition development management and
redevelopment of large retail community shopping center properties concentrated
in the western part of the united states in connection with the merger the
company acquired interests in 43 properties located in 17 states with the
completion of the price reit merger the company expanded its presence in
certain western states including california arizona and washington in
addition price reit had strong groundup development capabilities these
development capabilities coupled with the companys own construction management
expertise provides the company on a selective basis the ability to pursue
groundup development opportunities

also during 1998 the company formed kir an entity in which the company held a
9999 limited partnership interest kir was established for the purpose of
investing in high quality properties financed primarily with individual
nonrecourse mortgages the company believes that these properties are
appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the company traditionally
uses at the time of formation the company contributed 19 properties to kir
each encumbered by an individual nonrecourse mortgage during 1999 kir sold a
significant interest in the partnership to institutional investors as of
december 31 2003 the company holds a 433 noncontrolling limited partnership
interest in kir and accounts for its investment in kir under the equity method
of accounting see recent developments  operating real estate joint venture
investments and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included in this annual report on form 10k

in connection with the tax relief extension act of 1999 the rma which became
effective january 1 2001 the company is now permitted to participate in
activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its
qualification as a reit so long as these activities are conducted in entities
which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code subject to
certain limitations as such the company through its taxable reit
subsidiaries is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities
including i merchant building through its whollyowned taxable reit
subsidiary kimco developers inc kdi which is primarily engaged in the
groundup development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and
subsequent sale thereof upon completion see recent developments  kimco
developers inc kdi ii retail real estate advisory and disposition
services which primarily focus on leasing and disposition strategies for real
estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and iii
acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange
transactions the company will consider other investments through taxable reit
subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise

during october 2001 the company continued its geographical expansion by forming
the riocan venture with riocan real estate investment trust riocan canadas
largest publicly traded reit measured by gla in which the company has a
noncontrolling 50 interest to acquire retail properties and development
projects in canada the company accounts for this investment under the equity
method of accounting see recent developments  operating real estate joint
venture investments and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included in this annual report on form 10k

smaller equity interest and provides management leasing and operational support

real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services
to both healthy and distressed retailers the company also makes selective
investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other

the companys neighborhood and community shopping center properties are designed
to attract local area customers and typically are anchored by a discount
department store a supermarket or drugstore tenant offering daytoday

purchase or lease incomeproducing properties in the future and may also
participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships

other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection

to joint ventures in which it may or may not participate in the future

in addition to property or equity ownership the company provides property
management services for fees relating to the management leasing operation

maintenance periodic renovation and capital improvement it is possible that
properties in the portfolio may be sold in whole or in part as circumstances

diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a

neighborhood and community shopping center accounted for only 10 of the
companys annualized base rental revenues and only 06 of the companys total

were the home depot kmart corporation kohls royal ahold and tjx companies

competition   as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping
center industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of
neighborhood and community shopping centers the company has established close
relationships with a large number of major national and regional retailers and
maintains a broad network of industry contacts management is associated with
andor actively participates in many shopping center and reit industry
organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional
and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions
and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of
properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will
lease space in the companys properties

inflation and other business issues   many of the companys leases contain
provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions
include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent
calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined
thresholds percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise andor
escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of
the leases such escalation clauses include increases in the consumer price
index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases
are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to
increase rents upon renewal to market rates most of the companys leases
require the tenant to reimburse the company for their allocable share of
operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes
and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and
operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates
its exposure to shortterm interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and will from time to time enter into interest rate protection
agreements and foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not
eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and
changes in foreign currency exchange rates

purchase and ownership of the securities of the company as an owner of real

major tenants due to bankruptcy insolvency andor general downturn in their
business which could reduce the companys cash flow ii major tenants not
renewing their leases as they expire or renewing at lower rental rates which
could reduce the companys cash flow iii changes in retailing trends which
could reduce the need for shopping centers iv potential liability for future
or unknown environmental issues v changes in real estate and zoning laws and
competition from other real estate owners which could make it difficult to lease
or develop properties and vi the inability to acquire capital either in the
form of debt or equity on satisfactory terms to fund the companys cash
requirements the success of the company also depends upon trends in the
economy including but not limited to interest rates income tax laws
governmental regulations and legislation and population trends additionally
the company is subject to complex regulations related to its status as a reit
and would be adversely affected if it failed to maintain its qualification as a
reit

construction data processing maintenance finance and accounting are

york the company believes it is critical to have a management presence in its
principal areas of operation and accordingly the company maintains regional

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under
longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base
rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share
of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance
expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases
require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of
tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys
standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the
tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a
strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 1918 of the companys 6820 leases also contain provisions
requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants
gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for
approximately 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year
ended december 31 2003

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for
approximately 99 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the
year ended december 31 2003 the companys management believes that the base
rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is
generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic
regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

the fluctuation in exchange rates related to the canadian denominated leases
and iii a 005 increase relating to new leases signed net of leases vacated

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through geographic
and tenant diversity no single neighborhood and community shopping center
accounted for more than 06 of the companys total shopping center gla or more
than 10 of total annualized base rental revenues as of december 31 2003 the
companys five largest tenants include the home depot kmart corporation
kohls royal ahold and tjx companies which represent approximately 30 29
28 26 and 25 respectively of the companys annualized base rental
revenues including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from
properties in which the company has less than a 100 economic interest the
company maintains an active leasing and capital improvement program that
combined with the high quality of the locations has made in managements
opinion the companys properties attractive to tenants

its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an
advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of
property owners

area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses operating
expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include
payments received in connection with lease termination agreements

related to base rents expense reimbursements and other revenues the company
analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels customer credit
worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts in addition tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed

of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any
changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining
useful life

accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and
replacements which improve and extend the life of the asset are capitalized

intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired a property value is
considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected
operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property
over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the
property such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future
operating income trend and prospects as well as the effects of demand
competition and other factors to the extent impairment has occurred the
carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the
estimated fair value of the property

effects of inflation

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse
impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to
receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross
sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise
andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the
terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon
changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition
many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits
the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the
companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating
expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and
insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and
operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates
its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
and will from time to time enter into interest rate protection agreements
andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate
the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

organizations notwithstanding these relationships there are numerous regional
and local commercial developers real estate companies financial institutions
and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of
properties and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the companys
properties

inflation and other business issues many of the companys leases contain
provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation such provisions
include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent
calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above predetermined
thresholds percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise andor
escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of
the leases such escalation clauses include increases in the consumer price
index or similar inflation indices in addition many of the companys leases
are for terms of less than 10 years which permits the company to seek to
increase rents upon renewal to market rates most of the companys leases
require the tenant to reimburse the company for their allocable share of
operating expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes
and insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and
operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates
its exposure to shortterm interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and will from time to time enter into interest rate protection
agreements and foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not
eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and
changes in foreign currency exchange rates

the need for shopping centers iv potential liability for future or unknown
environmental issues v changes in real estate and zoning laws and competition
from other real estate owners which could make it difficult to lease or develop
properties and vi the inability to acquire capital either in the form of
debt or equity on satisfactory terms to fund the companys cash requirements

properties these projects usually include renovating existing facades
installing uniform signage resurfacing parking lots and enhancing parking lot
lighting during 2002 the company capitalized approximately 70 million in
connection with these property improvements and expensed to operations
approximately 154 million

the companys neighborhood and community shopping centers are usually anchored
by a national or regional discount department store supermarket or drugstore
as one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center
industry and one of the nations largest owners and operators of shopping
centers the company has established close relationships with a large number of
major national and regional retailers some of the major national and regional
companies that are tenants in the companys shopping center properties include
kmart corporation the home depot kohls tjx companies walmart best buy
toys r us royal ahold office max and petsmart

a substantial portion of the companys income consists of rent received under
longterm leases most of the leases provide for the payment of fixed base
rentals monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of an allocable share
of the real estate taxes insurance utilities and common area maintenance
expenses incurred in operating the shopping centers although many of the leases
require the company to make roof and structural repairs as needed a number of
tenant leases place that responsibility on the tenant and the companys
standard small store lease provides for roof repairs to be reimbursed by the
tenant as part of common area maintenance the companys management places a
strong emphasis on sound construction and safety at its properties

approximately 1879 of the companys 6375 leases also contain provisions
requiring the payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants
gross sales above predetermined thresholds percentage rents accounted for
approximately 1 of the companys revenues from rental property for the year
ended december 31 2002

minimum base rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements accounted for
approximately 99 of the companys total revenues from rental property for the
year ended december 31 2002 the companys management believes that the base
rent per leased square foot for many of the companys existing leases is
generally lower than the prevailing marketrate base rents in the geographic
regions where the company operates reflecting the potential for future growth

average base rent per leased square foot in its portfolio of neighborhood and
community shopping centers excluding the kir and krop portfolios from 808 to
831 an increase of 023 this increase primarily consists of a 026
increase relating to acquisitions and dispositions and a 013 increase relating
to new leases signed partially offset by a decrease of 016 relating primarily
to the impact of the kmart bankruptcy filing and subsequent lease rejections

the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through geographic
and tenant diversity no single neighborhood and community shopping center
accounted for more than 08 of the companys total shopping center gla or more
than 12 of total annualized base rental revenues as of december 31 2002 the
companys five largest tenants include kmart corporation see recent
developments  kmart bankruptcy the home depot kohls tjx companies and
walmart which represent approximately 45 28 27 25 and 19
respectively of the companys annualized base rental revenues including the
proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the company
has less than a 100 economic interest the company maintains an active leasing
and capital improvement program that combined with the high quality of the
locations has made in managements opinion the companys properties
attractive to tenants

the companys management believes its experience in the real estate industry and
its relationships with numerous national and regional tenants gives it an
advantage in an industry where ownership is fragmented among a large number of
property owners

consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial
statements including trends which might appear should not be taken as

critical accounting policies

the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the
company its whollyowned subsidiaries and all partnerships in which the company
has a controlling interest the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances
that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and related notes in preparing these financial statements
management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities these estimates are based on but not limited
to historical results industry standards and current economic conditions
giving due consideration to materiality the most significant assumptions and
estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts
receivable depreciable lives and valuation of real estate application of these
assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and as

addition leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common
area maintenance real estate taxes and other operating expenses operating
expense reimbursements are recognized as earned rental income may also include
payments received in connection with lease termination agreements

effects of inflation

many of the companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse
impact of inflation such provisions include clauses enabling the company to
receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross
sales above predetermined thresholds which generally increase as prices rise
andor escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the
terms of the leases such escalation clauses often include increases based upon
changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices in addition
many of the companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years which permits
the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal most of the
companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating
expenses including common area maintenance costs real estate taxes and
insurance thereby reducing the companys exposure to increases in costs and
operating expenses resulting from inflation the company periodically evaluates
its exposure to shortterm interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
and will from time to time enter into interest rate protection agreements
andor foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate but do not eliminate
the effect of changes in interest rates on its floatingrate debt and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
