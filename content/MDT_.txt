other factors impacting our operations 

covid19 pandemic 

the global covid19 pandemic together with the preventative and precautionary measures taken by businesses communities and governments has impacted and may continue to impact significant aspects of our company and business including future procedural volumes supply constraints healthcare staffing worker absenteeism with our customers suppliers and in our own operations and field teams and resulting impacts on demand for our products and therapies see “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in hundreds of clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use developing new therapies and procedures and entering into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets generating clinical evidence and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to address unmet clinical needs produce better patient outcomes and create new standards of care 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary technology in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole 

we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time 

sales and distribution 

we sell our medical devices and therapies through a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors globally additionally a portion of the companys revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals surgical centers and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers group purchasing organizations gpos and integrated delivery networks idns we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our four largest markets are the us western europe china and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide to achieve this objective our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products 

we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition industry and cost containment 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts results of clinical trials to support superiority claims and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition declining reimbursement rates and national and provincial tender pricing competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private healthcare insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms hospitals which purchase our technology are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example centralized purchasing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization this has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components 

however due to the us fda’s manufacturing requirements we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “item 2 properties” in this annual report on form 10k 

government regulation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european regulatory authorities such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom republic of ireland and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices in germany the china national medical product administration nmpa  and other government agencies inside and outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

product approval and monitoring 

many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance safety and quality of our products authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the us is generally obtained in one of two primary ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use this process is generally much more timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes the competent authorities of the eu countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market a new medical device regulation was published by the eu in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements eu mdr the regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on may 26 2021 medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements except that devices with valid ce certificates issued pursuant to the medical device directives before may 2020 can be placed on the market until may 2024 

the global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact the cost the time needed to approve and ultimately our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products regulations of the us fda and other regulatory agencies in and outside the us impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business these agencies review our design and manufacturing practices labeling record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other regulatory bodies both in and outside the us including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the promotion and advertising of our products any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors we are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations  

trade regulations 

the movement of products services and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders these laws and regulations govern among other things our import export and other business activities we are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if we or the third parties through which we do business are not in compliance with applicable import export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs new compliance challenges and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

our global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security confidentiality and breach notification laws at the state level federal level and international level examples of those laws include the health insurance and portability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech in the us the global data protection regulation gdpr within the european union and various other country specific requirements around the world 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities or withdrawal of noncompliant products from a market 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by the us department of health and human services hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services 

us federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federallyfunded healthcare programs including laws related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals or other healthcare fraud there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to state medicaid and other healthcare programs and private thirdparty payers in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

implementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered together with all the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the sec furthermore additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties 

business and operational risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

• product performance and reliability 

• product technology and innovation 

• product quality and safety 

• breadth of product lines 

• product support services 

• customer support 

• costeffectiveness and price 

• reimbursement approval from healthcare insurance providers and 

• changes to the regulatory environment 

competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies from time to time we have lost and may in the future lose market share in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products which highlights the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems to our business in the current environment of managed care consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition declining reimbursement rates and national and provincial tender pricing as recently experienced in china competitively priced product offerings are essential to our success further our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop acquire and market new and differentiated products technologies and intellectual property and as a result we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain aspects of our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations and interactions with healthcare systems providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 in particular the continuing preventative and precautionary measures that we and other businesses communities and governments have taken to mitigate the spread of the disease has led to restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on business and personal activities including reduced customer demand for certain of our products and has resulted in many of our employees working remotely we expect medical procedure rates to continue to vary by therapy and country and could be impacted by regional covid19 case volumes healthcare system staffing shortages patient’s willingness to schedule deferrable procedures travel restrictions transportation limitations quarantine restrictions vaccine and booster immunization rates and new covid19 variants while covid19 case volumes appear to be decreasing in the us and certain other countries as a result of higher vaccination rates the global covid19 outlook remains uncertain as new variants emerge 

together with the preventative and precautionary measures being taken as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new and improved methods of conducting business such as increased remote monitoring covid19 is having and may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our company and business including the demand for and supply of certain of our products operations supply chains and distribution systems impacts or delays to product development milestones clinical trials or regulatory clearances and approval timing and our ability to generate cash flow and may have an adverse impact on our ability to access capital some of our products are more sensitive to reductions in deferrable and emergent medical procedures and as hospital systems prioritize treatment of covid19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines certain medical procedures have been and may continue to be suspended or postponed it is not possible to predict the timing of deferrable medical procedures and to the extent individuals and hospital systems deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures or if unemployment or loss of insurance coverage adversely impacts an individual’s ability to pay for our products and services our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could continue to be negatively affected further the covid19 pandemic has strained hospital systems around the world resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems that could result in reduced future expenditures for certain capital equipment and other products and services we provide as well as potential disruption of product launches of our recently approved products 

a number of our global suppliers vendors and distributors have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including employee absenteeism these impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers and any such delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for certain of our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability 

covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and capital markets including by negatively impacting demand for a number of our products access to capital markets including the commercial paper market foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates each of which may adversely impact our business and liquidity we could experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers suppliers and vendors facing liquidity issues as a result we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow 

covid19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex productions and operations including our executive officers and other key members of our management team 

while the impact of covid19 has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain and unpredictable as we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic 

reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture the majority of our products and procure important thirdparty services such as sterilization services at numerous facilities worldwide we purchase many of the components raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we seek to maintain continuity of supply by use of multiple options for sourcing where possible we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials components and services although global shortages of certain components such as semiconductors and resins have recently caused and may in the future cause disruptions to our product manufacturing supply chain in addition for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain components raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these components raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies including the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources additionally many regulatory agencies are imposing regulatory requirements on safe use of 

chemicals and their potential impact on health and the environment which also may impact supply constraints furthermore the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and could result in lost sales 

other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or wildfires property damage or facility closures from riots or public protests and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and actions by businesses communities and governments in response could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation for example in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing processes and we have been adversely impacted by and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global covid19 pandemic and the responses of governments and of our partners including suppliers manufacturers distributors and other businesses furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues 

in addition many of our products require sterilization before sale and several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities such as the illinois environmental protection agencys decision to close a suppliers sterilization facility in february 2019 we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products to the required quality specifications or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility a thirdparty may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives which requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with healthcare professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic our access to these professionals has been limited at times and travel restrictions shutdowns and similar measures have impacted our ability to maintain these relationships thereby affecting our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products if we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have debt obligations that create risk 

we are required to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future to supplement our existing liquidity and cash generated from operations to satisfy our needs for working capital and capital expenditures to pursue growth initiatives and to make returns of capital to shareholders at the time we incur such additional indebtedness or refinance or restructure existing indebtedness we may be unable to obtain capital market financing with similar terms and currency denomination or at 

all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations at any time the value of our debt outstanding will fluctuate based on several factors including foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully as well as liabilities or claims relating to such acquired businesses could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business further acquired businesses may have liabilities or be subject to claims litigation or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies 

• our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner 

• liabilities claims litigation investigations or other adverse developments relating to acquired businesses or the business practices of acquired companies including investigations by governmental entities potential fcpa or product liability claims or other unanticipated liabilities 

• any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices including price increases 

• our ability to retain key employees and 

• the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 

we also could experience negative effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices and technologies as well as our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance it may 

• take a significant amount of time 

• require the expenditure of substantial resources 

• involve stringent clinical and preclinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillance 

• involve modifications repairs or replacements of our products and 

• limit the proposed uses of our products 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under the us fda and other applicable nonus government agency regulations for instance many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with applicable regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products order 

a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda and other nonus government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations furthermore we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we cannot predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigations any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs andor entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligations these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

governmental regulations in the us and outside the us are constantly changing and may become increasingly stringent in the european union for example the medical device regulation which became effective in may 2021 includes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for regulatory noncompliance could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions the development and implementation of future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers in certain circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

we are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful any of which could have a material adverse impact on our 

business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets or agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage in addition our patents will expire over time our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain and infringement may go undetected third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all in addition license agreements could be terminated we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality problems could lead to recalls or safety alerts product liability claims reputational harm adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients and the serious and potentially costly consequences of adverse product performance our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing nonconformances design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products if they were to occur could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic brand a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in diminished market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future further we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed manufactured andor marketed in response to the covid19 pandemic and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with covid19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or related claims as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

any of the foregoing problems including future product liability claims or recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years there have been and continue to be actions and proposals by several governments regulators and thirdparty payers globally including the us federal and state governments to control these costs and more generally to reform healthcare systems certain of these actions and proposals among other things limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products these actions and proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the proper function security and availability of our information technology systems and data as well as those of third parties throughout our global supply chain to operate our business and a breach cyberattack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business that technology includes systems that could be used to process transmit and store sensitive data additionally many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to other internal systems one of the most prevalent attacks on large organizations has been ransomware which can have a devastating impact on an organization’s operations we have invested in ransomware readiness in the pursuit of both prevention and rapid response to a ransomware event like all organizations we routinely experience attempted interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems via events such as cyberattacks malicious intrusions or other breakdowns the consequences could mean data breaches interference with the integrity of our products and data compromise of intellectual property or other proprietary information or other significant disruptions furthermore we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems and resulting products as we have seen with recent “supply chain attacks” these thirdparty systems could also become vulnerable to cyberattack malicious intrusions breakdowns interference or other significant disruptions and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems the russiaukraine conflict may increase cybersecurity risks on a global basis lastly we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and as a result may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems 

our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “item 1 business – other factors impacting our operations – data privacy and security laws and regulations  any data security breaches cyberattacks malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies andor civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems this enables us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our extensive efforts including but not limited to consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 

if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised there are many consequences that could result consequences include but are not limited to patients or employees being exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality losing existing customers or have difficulty attracting new customers experiencing difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud being exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information having disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals suffering regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experiencing increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incurring expenses or losing revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffering other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

the failure to comply with anticorruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the irish criminal justice corruption offences act 2018 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentadministered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws we also participate in publicprivate partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased in recent years including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors we maintain policies and programs to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and to prevent and prohibit improper practices however existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or 

distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the us commerce department’s bureau of industry and security bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions or export restrictions our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere presents risks to our current and future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires or flooding such extreme weather conditions and other conditions caused by or related to climate change could increase our operational costs pose physical risks to our facilities and adversely impact our supply chain including manufacturing and distribution networks the availability and cost of raw materials and components energy supply transportation or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business the impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity which could impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs concerns over climate change could have an impact on customer demand for our products and result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment although it is difficult to predict and adequately prepare to meet the challenges to our business posed by climate change if new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations as well as adverse impacts on raw material sourcing manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites and emissions or discharges into the land air or water we are further subject to numerous laws and regulations concerning among other things chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations and those of certain thirdparty suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined or otherwise sanctioned new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of 

future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us ireland and various other jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with us taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the us corporate tax rate in addition the biden administration has provided a framework for proposed us tax law changes which if enacted could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in october 2021 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd secured agreement from 136 countries to push forward with proposals to fundamentally rewrite international tax rules which if enacted by these countries will likely impact the amount of tax multinationals such as medtronic pay in the future during 2022 and 2023 more details on these proposals will be released and various consultations will take place the oecd has set a timeline for the implementation of these proposals in 2023 but may end up being deferred to a later date 

the aggressive nature of the timeline set by the oecd may mean that all implications for business may not have been fully worked through or fully understood before rules are finalized we continue to monitor the implications potentially resulting from this guidance this action together with other legislative changes in many countries on the mandatory sharing of company information financial and operational with taxing authorities on a local and global basis under various information sharing initiatives could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws regulations and treaties where applicable in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing sites an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because medtronic plc is organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in addition a retroactive change to us tax laws in this area could change this classification if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly at our 2021 annual general meeting our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 10 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders provided that with respect to 5 of such shares such allotment is to be used for the purposes of a specified capital investment both of these authorizations will expire on june 9 2023 unless renewed by shareholders for a further period we anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2022 annual general meeting and in subsequent years we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers 

have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in ireland but who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children currently have a taxfree threshold of €335000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents irish revenue typically updates the amount of this taxfree threshold on an annual basis 

economic and industry risks 

changes in the prices of our goods and services andor inflationary costs may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for certain of our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers on our customers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers we have also recently experienced and may continue to experience rising costs due to inflation if the prices for our goods and services change or inflation continues to rise we may be unable to sufficiently reduce our expenses or offset rising costs through increased prices to customers as a result our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

we develop manufacture distribute and sell our products globally we intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the us especially in emerging markets operations in different countries including emerging markets could expose us to additional and greater risks and potential costs including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• healthcare reform legislation 

• the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• longerterm receivables than are typical in the us 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other border taxes and import or export licensing requirements 

• less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the us than exists in the us 

• different labor regulations and workforce instability 

• political and economic instability including as a result of wars and insurrections 

• the expiration and nonrenewal of foreign tax rulings andor grants 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws and 

• economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations 

the ongoing global economic competition and trade tensions between the us and china present risk to medtronic although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact on medtronic from increased duties imposed by both sides through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions tariff exclusions awarded to medtronic by the us government require periodic renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect medtronic’s access to the markets china comprises approximately eight percent of our total revenues 

the russiaukraine conflict and resulting sanctions and export restrictions are creating barriers to doing business in russia and adversely impacting global supply chains while we have no manufacturing distribution or direct material suppliers in the region we are closely monitoring the potential raw materialsubtier supplier impact in both russia and ukraine materials like palladium and neon which are both dependent on russia supply are part of broader semiconductor shortages in industry additional sanctions export restrictions and 

potential countermeasures within russia may lead to greater uncertainty and geopolitical shifts in asia that could cause additional adverse impacts on global supply chains and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

more generally several governments including the us have raised the possibility of policies to induce “reshoring” of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production examples include potential “buy america” requirements in the us if such steps triggered retaliation in other markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the result could be a significant impact on medtronic 

other significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic and the responses of business and governments to the pandemic have at times resulted in reduced availability of air transport port closures increased border controls or closures increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain and countries may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many healthcare industry companies including healthcare systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

healthcare industry costcontainment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components 

most of our customers and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals and gpos and idns have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies including us

the following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 

in march 2019 the companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of 60 billion of the companys ordinary shares there is no specific timeperiod associated with these repurchase authorizations for additional discussion see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the eu if they had been made between member states of the eu this act and underlying eu regulations provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea russia somalia sudan syria tunisia certain persons and groups in ukraine and zimbabwe 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations or eu sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

• in the case of a beneficial owner of medtronic shares held in the depository trust company dtc the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the united states and this information is provided by the broker to the company’s qualifying intermediary or 

• in the case of a record owner the record owner has provided to the company’s transfer agent a valid us certification of residence form 6166 or valid irish nonresident form v2 

irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

understanding our financial information 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company the discussi on focuses on our financial results for the fiscal year ended april 29 2022 fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal year ended april 30 2021 fiscal year 2021 a discussion on our results of operations for fiscal year 2021 as compared to the year ended april 24 2020 fiscal year 2020 is included in part ii item 7 mana gements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended april 30 2021  filed with the sec on june 25 2021 and is i ncorporated by reference into this form 10k  you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 29 2022 and april 30 2021 and for fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 which are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands and therefore the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding additionally certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding 

financial trends 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures and are intended to supplement and should not be considered as superior to financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we believe that nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the companys underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry 

as presented in the gaap to nongaap reconciliations section below our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the income tax provision adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows

executive level overview 

the global healthcare system is continuing to respond to the unprecedented challenge posed by the covid19 pandemic covid19 or the pandemic most of our businesses were affected by a decline in global procedural volumes during fiscal year 2021 particularly in the first and second quarters during fiscal year 2022 the pandemic to a lesser extent continued to affect most of our businesses including the most recent covid19 lockdown in china which began in late march in addition to the pandemic our business faced the impacts of healthcare system staffing shortages on procedural volumes and significant supply chain disruptions in certain businesses particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we cannot predict with confidence the duration and severity of the pandemic and its impact on global procedure volumes we expect medical procedure rates may continue to vary by therapy and country and to be impacted by regional covid19 case volumes vaccine and booster immunization rates and new covid19 variants additionally we cannot predict the impact healthcare system staffing shortages will have on procedural volumes and the impact supply chain disruptions will have on the business 

the following is a summary of revenue diluted earnings per share and cash flow for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

starting with the quarter ended april 29 2022 the company will no longer adjust nongaap financial measures for certain license payments for or acquisitions of technology not approved by regulators due to recent industry guidance from the us securities and exchange commission historical nongaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10k have been recast for comparability 

the tables below present reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with us gaap for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 





1 associated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses 

2 the charges primarily include business combination costs changes in fair value of contingent consideration specifically for the fiscal year ended april 30 2021 changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition 

3 we exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on our minority investments as we do not believe that these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations 

4 the charges represent estimated incremental costs of complying with the new european union medical device regulations for previously registered products and primarily include charges for contractors supporting the project and other direct thirdparty expenses which are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023 

5 the charges relate to the company’s june 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of the medtronic hvad system within the mechanical circulatory support operating unit mcs the charges included 515 million of noncash impairments primarily related to 409 million of intangible asset impairments as well as 366 million for commitments and obligations in connection with the decision including patient support obligations restructuring and other associated costs medtronic is committed to serving the needs of the approximately 3500 patients currently implanted with the hvad system 

6 the net benefit primarily relates to the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in tax basis for swiss cantonal purposes and a change in tax rates on deferred taxes associated with intellectual property which are partially offset by the amortization on previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions and a charge related to a change in the companys permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings 

7 the charges relate to the abandonment of certain intangible assets in our neuroscience segment 

8 the charges relate to the early redemption of approximately 60 billion of debt 

9 the net benefit primarily relates to the finalization of an audit at the irs appellate level for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and the capitalization of certain research and development costs for us income tax purposes which are partially offset by the impact of an intercompany sale of assets and a tax basis adjustment and amortization of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions 

free cash flow 

free cash flow a nongaap financial measure is calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



refer to the summary of cash flows section for drivers of the change in cash provided by operating activities 

net sales 

segment and division 

the charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by segment for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

the table below includes net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

segment and market geography 

the charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

the table below includes net sales by market geography for each of our segments for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 



1 us includes the united states and us territories 

2 nonus developed markets include japan australia new zealand korea canada and the countries of western europe 

3 emerging markets include the countries of the middle east africa latin america eastern europe and the countries of asia that are not included in the nonus developed markets as defined above 

the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the recovery of global procedure volumes from the downturn experienced in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the net sales increase was partially offset by supply chain challenges particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 as well as the impact of covid19 experienced in fiscal year 2022 particularly in the us and china for fiscal year 2022 currency had an unfavorable impact of 107 million on nonus developed markets and a favorable impact of 33 million on emerging markets 

looking ahead a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could negatively impact our business including without limitation 

• the uncertain and uneven impact of covid19 on future procedural volumes supply constraints including certain electronic components and semiconductors healthcare staffing worker absenteeism with our customers suppliers and in our own operations and field teams and resulting impacts on demand for our products and therapies 

• the potential impact that sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the russiaukraine conflict could have on revenue and supply chain the financial impact of the conflict in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves was not material and for the fiscal year ended april 29 2022 the business of the company in these countries represented less than 1 of the companys consolidated revenues and assets although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance 

• competitive product launches and pricing pressure geographic macroeconomic risks including general price inflation rising interest rates reimbursement challenges impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings delays in product registration approvals replacement cycle challenges and fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 

• national and provincial tender pricing for certain products particularly in china 

cardiovascular 

cardiovascular products include pacemakers insertable cardiac monitors cardiac resynchronization therapy devices implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd leads and delivery systems electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems balloons and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products cardiovascular also includes care management services and cath lab managed services clms within the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2022 were 114 billion an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021 currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2022 of 32 million the net sales increase was primarily due to the recovery of global procedure volumes from the declines experienced in fiscal year 2021 along with growth from recent product launches partially offset by global supply chain disruptions and declines in china due to recent covid19 lockdowns 

the charts below illustrate the percent of cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure crhf net sales increased 6 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 the increase was led by cardiac rhythm management with growth in tyrx antibacterial envelopes crtds and cardiac pacing therapies due to micra and transvenous pacemakers cardiac ablation solutions also led growth with strong sales of arctic front cryoablation systems the net sales growth was partially offset by a decline of medtronic hvad system net sales as a result of our june 2021 decision to stop the 

distribution and sale of the system the net sales for the medtronic hvad system for fiscal year 2021 was 141 million 

structural heart  aortic sha net sales increased 8 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 the increase was led by growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr net sales as a result of continued adoption of the corevalve evolut cardiac surgery also contributed to the net increase in sales as a result of broad growth across the business particularly from strong sales of extracorporeal life support ecls devices these increases were partially offset by declines within aortic caused by field corrective actions fca and covid19 challenges the most notable field corrective actions were for the valiant navion thoracic stent graft system fca issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the endurant iiiis stent graft systems fca issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 

coronary  peripheral vascular cpv net sales increased 5 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 the increase was led by growth in peripheral vascular health driven by strong performance of the recently launched abre venous selfexpanding stent system for deep venous disease as well as our superficial venous product portfolio including the venaseal and closurefast systems the increase was partially offset by declines in coronary as well as atherectomy products due to impacts of covid19 on procedural volumes 

in addition to the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors described in the executive level overview looking ahead we expect cardiovascular could be affected by the following

• our ability to successfully develop obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline which include but are not limited to our minimed 780g insulin pump and the guardian 4 sensor which have been submitted to the us fda 

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 

cost of products sold we continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management manufacturing improvements and optimizing our manufacturing network cost of products sold for fiscal year 2022 was 101 billion as compared to 105 billion for fiscal year 2021 the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was largely due to the conditions of the pandemic during fiscal year 2021 which resulted in recognizing a portion of our fixed overhead costs as period expenses increases in our reserves in our excess and obsolete inventory as well as negative impact from mix as products in higher demand had lower gross margins the decrease was also attributable to charges from field correction actions in the prior year fiscal year 2022 included 58 million of inventory writedowns associated with our june 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of medtronics hvad system mcs charges looking forward our cost of products sold likely will be further negatively impacted by inflation and higher labor and direct material costs 

research and development expense we remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for every patient physician and caregiver we serve to create technologies that expand what’s possible across the entire human body to transform lives to turn data and insights into real action to serve real patient needs dramatically improving care and to expand healthcare access and deliver positive outcomes that go far beyond our products research and development expense for fiscal year 2022 was 27 billion as compared to 25 billion for fiscal year 2021 fiscal year 2022 included 101 million of acquisitions of and license payments for technology not approved by regulators primarily in our diabetes segment 

selling general and administrative expense our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives selling general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses selling general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2022 was 103 billion as compared to 101 billion for fiscal year 2021 the decrease in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by net sales growth as a result of the recovery of procedural volumes partially offset by increases in employee travel as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year when travel was limited

certain litigation charges we classify specified certain litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the consolidated statements of income for additional information refer to note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

other operating expense net other operating expense net primarily includes royalty income and expense currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses puerto rico excise taxes changes in the fair value of contingent consideration changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition mcs charges impairment charges and income from funded research and development arrangements 

the increase in other operating expense net was primarily driven by mcs charges recorded in fiscal year 2022 the charges of 823 million primarily included 409 million of intangible asset impairments and 366 million for commitments and obligations including 

customer support obligations restructuring and other associated costs the increase was partially offset by changes in fair value of contingent consideration which resulted in 103 million of income for fiscal year 2022 as compared to 36 million of expense in fiscal year 2021 the net currency impact of remeasurement expense and our hedging programs also partially offset the increase with 70 million of income in fiscal year 2022 and 47 million of expense in fiscal year 2021 finally contributing to the change was a 132 million gain related to amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition and 76 million of impairment charges related to the abandonment of certain intangible assets both in fiscal year 2021 additional information regarding the mcs charges is described in note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

other nonoperating income net other nonoperating income net includes the nonservice component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost investment gains and losses and interest income the decrease in other nonoperating income net for fiscal year 2022 is driven by our equity method and minority investments portfolio offset by an increase in income from the nonservice component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost gains on equity method and minority investments were 30 million and 61 million for fiscal year 2022 and 2021 respectively and income related to the nonservice component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits were 107 million and 86 million respectively 

interest expense interest expense includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts amortization of gains or losses on terminated or dedesignated interest rate derivative instruments and charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of senior notes the decrease in interest expense for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the 308 million charge incurred as a result of the early redemption of approximately 60 billion of debt during fiscal year 2021 

income taxes 

many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our us statutory rate thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the us statutory rate of 210 percent a significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in puerto rico switzerland and ireland the statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 125 percent to 375 percent our earnings in puerto rico are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country’s statutory tax rates unless our tax incentive grants are extended they will expire between fiscal years 2023 and 2034 the tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2022 did not have a material impact on our financial results see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was 83 percent as compared to 68 percent in fiscal year 2021 our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was 126 percent as compared to 118 percent in fiscal year 2021 the increase in both the effective tax rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate was primarily due to yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2022 we recognized 89 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 46 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and a 43 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

during fiscal year 2021 we recognized 51 million of operational tax benefits which included a 46 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 of approximately 86 million and 68 million respectively 

certain tax adjustments 

during fiscal year 2022 the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of 50 million recognized in income tax provision benefit in the consolidated statement of income included the following 

• a benefit of 82 million associated with a step up in tax basis for swiss cantonal purposes

• a net cost of 25 million associated with an internal restructuring and intercompany sale of assets 

• a benefit of 83 million related to the capitalization of certain research and development costs for us income tax purposes and the establishment of a deferred tax asset at the us federal statutory tax rate 

certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider these nongaap adjustments refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion of these adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are currently in a strong financial position and we believe our balance sheet and liquidity as of april 29 2022 provide us with flexibility and our cash cash equivalents and current investments along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs 

our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes we consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations which includes working capital needs investments in research and development property plant and equipment and other operating costs we also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases satisfying maturing debt and acquiring businesses and technology 

summary of cash flows 

the following is a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and the net change in cash and cash equivalents 

operating activities the 11 billion increase in net cash provided was primarily driven by an increase in cash collected from customers along with a decrease in cash paid for income taxes the increase in net cash provided was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to employees the increase in cash collected from customers was primarily related to covid19 driving decreased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and first quarter of fiscal year 2021 the decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to increased estimated federal tax payments and tax payments associated with irs audit settlements in fiscal year 2021 cash paid to employees increased due to higher annual incentive plan payouts compared to the prior fiscal year 

investing activities the 12 billion decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 903 million as well as a decrease of net purchases of investments of 273 million as compared to fiscal year 2021 

financing activities the 12 billion increase in net cash used was largely the result of the increase of share repurchases of 19 billion the increase in net cash used was offset by a decrease in shortterm borrowings of 311 million for fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were impacted by the mizuho bank term loan under which we borrowed ¥300 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 which was subsequently repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were also impacted by the issuance of 72 billion of eurodenominated senior notes offset by the early redemption of 60 billion of senior notes for 63 billion of total consideration and repayment of an additional 911 million of eurodenominated senior notes for more information on the mizuho bank term loan and issuances and redemptions of senior notes refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

interest rates on advances of our credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by standard  poors ratings services sp and moodys investors service moody’s facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates we are in compliance with all covenants related to the credit facility 

the following table is a summary of our sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings 



1 agency ratings are subject to change and there may be no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings andor maintain its current ratings a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 29 2022 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 30 2021 we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet credit facility and related commercial paper programs 

contractual obligations and cash requirements 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business some of which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

presented below is a summary of our offbalance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at april 29 2022 as well as longterm contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at april 29 2022

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements 

note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested we expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future in addition we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

beyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures research and developments costs and other operational costs 

we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and our cash cash equivalents current investments credit facility and related commercial paper programs as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our current and future contractual obligations and cash requirements we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

litigation contingencies we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property and commercial disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations the outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice the company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or 

considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and may be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

income tax reserves we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets primarily include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and inprocess research and development determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle the estimates could be impacted by legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for impairment of goodwill requires us to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

we also test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

our tests for goodwill and intangible assets are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participants view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates

any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis

other factors impacting our operations 

covid19 pandemic 

the global covid19 pandemic covid19 or the pandemic together with the preventative and precautionary measures taken by businesses communities and governments has impacted and may continue to impact significant aspects of our company and business including demand for our products our operations supply chains and distribution systems and our ability to research and develop and bring new products and services to market see “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many 

table of contents 

clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use developing new therapies and procedures and entering into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets generating clinical evidence and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to address unmet clinical needs produce better patient outcomes and create new standards of care 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary technology in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole 

we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time for additional information see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business we also sell through distributors in the us additionally a portion of the companys revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgical centers and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our four largest markets are the us western europe china and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide to achieve this objective our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products 

we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition industry and cost containment 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts results of clinical trials to support superiority claims and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition declining reimbursement rates and national tender pricing competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these initiatives 

table of contents 

put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private healthcare insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms hospitals which purchase our technology are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example centralized purchasing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization this has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however due to the us fda’s manufacturing requirements we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “item 2 properties” in this annual report on form 10k 

government regulation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european regulatory authorities such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom republic of ireland and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices in germany the china national medical product administration nmpa  and other government agencies inside and outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

product approval and monitoring 

many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance safety and quality of our products authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the us is generally obtained in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use this process is generally much more timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes the competent authorities of the eu countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market a new medical device regulation was published by the eu in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements eu mdr the regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on may 26 2021 medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements except that devices with valid ce certificates issued pursuant to the medical device directives before may 2020 can be placed on the market until may 2024 

the global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact the cost the time needed to approve and ultimately our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products regulations of the us fda and other regulatory agencies in and outside the us impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business these agencies review our design and manufacturing practices labeling record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential 

table of contents 

problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other regulatory bodies both in and outside the us including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the promotion and advertising of our products any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors we are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations  

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our pain therapies divisions synchromed ii drug infusion system and its associated quality system the consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system were lifted by the us fda in september 2017 the final required thirdparty expert audit is complete and following a successful us fda inspection and in coordination with the us fda medtronic can move to have the consent decree vacated 

trade regulations 

the movement of products services and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders these laws and regulations govern among other things our import export and other business activities we are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if we or the third parties through which we do business are not in compliance with applicable import export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs new compliance challenges and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

for example in the us the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels 

us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers privacy and security rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and by their “business associates” which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce rules under hipaa and hitech include specific security standards and breach notification requirements the us department of health and human services hhs through the office of civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with respect to both the security and privacy rules including civil and criminal liability except for certain of its operations in its diabetes and care management services businesses medtronic is generally not a 

table of contents 

covered entity medtronic also operates as a business associate to covered entities in several instances there are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by healthcare providers and medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses 

in addition to the regulation of personal health information a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data state consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumers 

outside the us we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international federal and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customers in more than 150 countries legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalties in the eu stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in may 2018 the eu general data protection regulation gdpr applies uniformly across the eu and includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies based outside of the eu but processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services 

us federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federallyfunded healthcare programs including laws related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to state medicaid and other healthcare programs and private thirdparty payers in some circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

implementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered together with all the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the sec furthermore additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties 

business and operational risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

• product performance and reliability 

• product technology and innovation 

• product quality and safety 

• breadth of product lines 

• product support services 

• customer support 

• costeffectiveness and price

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain aspects of our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations and interactions with healthcare systems providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 in particular the continuing preventative and precautionary measures that we and other businesses communities and governments have taken to mitigate the spread of the disease has led to restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on business and personal activities including reduced customer demand for certain of our products and has resulted in many of our employees working remotely we expect medical procedure rates to continue to vary by therapy and country and could be impacted by regional covid19 case volumes hospital and clinical occupancy and staffing levels patient’s willingness to schedule deferrable procedures travel restrictions transportation limitations quarantine restrictions vaccine immunization rates and new covid19 variants while covid19 case volumes appear to be decreasing in the us and certain other countries as a result of higher vaccination rates the global covid19 outlook remains uncertain as vaccination rates remain low in much of the world 

together with the preventative and precautionary measures being taken as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new and improved methods of conducting business such as increased remote monitoring covid19 is having and may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our company and business including the demand for and supply of certain of our products operations supply chains and distribution systems impacts or delays to product development milestones clinical trials or regulatory clearances and approval timing and our ability to generate cash flow and may have an adverse impact on our ability to access capital some of our products are more sensitive to reductions in deferrable and emergent medical procedures and as hospital systems prioritize treatment of covid19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines certain medical procedures have been and may continue to be suspended or postponed the company has certain product lines that are in higher demand as a result of covid19 such as ventilators pulse oximetry capnography advanced parameter monitoring and extracorporeal life support products it is not possible to predict the timing of deferrable medical procedures and to the extent individuals and hospital systems deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures or if unemployment or loss of insurance coverage adversely impacts an individual’s ability to pay for our products and services our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could continue to be negatively affected further the covid19 pandemic has strained hospital systems around the world resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems that could result in reduced future expenditures for certain capital equipment and other products and services we provide as well as potential disruption of product launches of our recently approved products 

a number of our global suppliers vendors and distributors have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including employee absenteeism these impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers and any such delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for certain of our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability 

covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and capital markets including by negatively impacting demand for a number of our products access to capital markets including the commercial paper market foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates each of which may adversely impact our business and liquidity we could experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers suppliers and vendors facing liquidity issues as a result we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow 

covid19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex productions and operations including our executive officers and other key members of our management team 

while the impact of covid19 has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain and unpredictable as we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic 

reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture the majority of our products and procure important thirdparty services such as sterilization services at numerous facilities worldwide we purchase many of 

table of contents 

the components raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we seek to maintain continuity of supply by use of multiple options for sourcing where possible we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials components and services however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain components raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these components raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies including the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources additionally many regulatory agencies are imposing regulatory requirements on safe use of chemicals and their potential impact on health and the environment which also may impact supply constraints furthermore the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and could result in lost sales 

other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes or wildfires property damage or facility closures from riots or public protests and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and actions by businesses communities and governments in response could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation for example in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing processes and we have been adversely impacted by and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global covid19 pandemic and the responses of governments and of our partners including suppliers manufacturers distributors and other businesses furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues 

in addition many of our products require sterilization before sale and several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities such as the damage caused by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 or illinois environmental protection agencys decision to close a suppliers sterilization facility in february 2019 we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products to the required quality specifications or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility a thirdparty may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives which requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with healthcare professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic our access to these professionals has been limited at times and travel restrictions shutdowns and 

table of contents 

similar measures have impacted our ability to maintain these relationships thereby affecting our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products if we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

at april 30 2021 we had approximately 264 billion of debt of which all is noncurrent except 110 million we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on floating rate borrowings is variable 

our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully as well as liabilities or claims relating to such acquired businesses could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business further acquired businesses may have liabilities or be subject to claims litigation or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies 

• our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner 

• liabilities claims litigation investigations or other adverse developments relating to acquired businesses or the business practices of acquired companies including investigations by governmental entities potential fcpa or product liability claims or other unanticipated liabilities 

• any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices including price increases 

• our ability to retain key employees and 

• the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 

we also could experience negative effects on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense

legal and regulatory risks 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires or flooding such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs the impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products 

we are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices and technologies as well as our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance it may 

• take a significant amount of time 

• require the expenditure of substantial resources 

• involve stringent clinical and preclinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillance 

• involve modifications repairs or replacements of our products and 

• limit the proposed uses of our products 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under the us fda and other applicable nonus government agency regulations for instance many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with applicable regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda and other nonus government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations furthermore we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we cannot predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigations any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs andor entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligations these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

governmental regulations outside the us have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and common in the european union for example a new medical device regulation which became effective in may 2021 includes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for regulatory noncompliance could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers in certain circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

we are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets or agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts reputational harm adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients and the serious and potentially costly consequences of product failure our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing nonconformances design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products if they were to occur could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future further we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed manufactured andor marketed in response to the covid19 pandemic and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with covid19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or related claims as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

any of the foregoing problems including future product liability claims or recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by several governments regulators and thirdparty payers globally including the us federal and state governments to control these costs and more generally to reform healthcare systems certain of these proposals could among other things limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

the failure to comply with anticorruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the irish criminal justice corruption offences act 2018 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentadministered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws we also participate in publicprivate partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased in recent years including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors we maintain policies and programs to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and to prevent and prohibit improper practices however existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations and those of certain thirdparty suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods

the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the proper function security and availability of our information technology systems and data as well as those of third parties throughout our global supply chain to operate our business and a breach cyberattack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business that technology includes systems that could be used to process transmit and store sensitive data additionally many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to other internal systems like all organizations we routinely experience attempted interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems via events such as cyberattacks malicious intrusions or other breakdowns the consequences could mean data breaches interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions furthermore we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems and resulting products as we have seen with recent “supply chain attacks” these thirdparty systems could also become vulnerable to cyberattack malicious intrusions breakdowns interference or other significant disruptions and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems lastly we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and as a result may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems 

our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “item 1 business – other factors impacting our operations – data privacy and security laws and regulations  for example gdpr prefers that we manage personal data in the eu and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations furthermore there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyberattacks any data security breaches cyberattacks malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies andor civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems this enables us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our extensive efforts including but not limited to consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future further the covid19 pandemic and related government actions continues to mandate that our employees work remotely which could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technologies systems 

if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised there are many consequences that could result consequences include but are not limited to patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality losing existing customers or have difficulty attracting new customers experiencing difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us ireland and various other jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and

jobs act the tax act which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with us taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the us corporate tax rate while the us treasury has issued a significant amount of guidance to date on the interpretation of the tax act there remains regulations that have not yet been issued in final form in addition the biden administration has provided a framework for proposed us tax law changes which if enacted could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published an action plan called base erosion and profit shifting beps with the purpose of tackling perceived tax abuses inconsistency between taxing authorities and their respective approach to international tax matters thereafter many taxing authorities have adopted the beps guidelines into their local laws in addition the european union eu expanded upon these guidelines with their antitax avoidance directive atad 1  2 to be applied by all member states by 2020 in 2018 the oecd announced its intention to expand the scope of beps beps 20 to provide a longterm solution to taxing right challenges arising from the global digital economy the oecd expects to release the final agreed beps 20 guidelines in the summer of 2021 jurisdictions would then need to enact legislation to adopt the guidelines into law the proposals as currently drafted are categorized into two groups commonly referred to as pillars pillar one is focused on providing a mechanism for taxing rights more closely with market engagement generally where people or consumers are located pillar two is focused on establishing a global minimum tax and would apply when a country’s income tax rate is below a stilltobe determined minimum tax rate these proposals are wide ranging and could affect all multinational enterprises across all industries without regard to their level of engagement with the digital economy the aggressive nature of the timeline set by the oecd may mean that all implications for business may not have been fully worked through or fully understood by the oecd before final guidelines are issued we continue to monitor the implications potentially resulting from this guidance this action together with other legislative changes in many countries on the mandatory sharing of company information financial and operational with taxing authorities on a local and global basis under various information sharing initiatives could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws regulations and treaties where applicable in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing sites an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because medtronic plc is organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in addition a retroactive change to us tax laws in this area could change this classification if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly at our 2020 annual general meeting our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 10 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders provided that with respect to 5 of such shares such allotment is to be used for the purposes of a specified capital investment both of these authorizations will expire on june 11 2022 unless renewed by shareholders for a further period we anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2021 annual general meeting and in subsequent years we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €335000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents irish revenue typically updates the amount of this taxfree threshold on an annual basis 

economic and industry risks 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for certain of our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers on our customers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

we develop manufacture distribute and sell our products globally we intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the us especially in emerging markets operations in different countries including emerging markets could expose us to additional and greater risks and potential costs including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• healthcare reform legislation 

• the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• longerterm receivables than are typical in the us 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other border taxes and import or export licensing requirements 

• less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the us than exists in the us 

• different labor regulations and workforce instability 

• political and economic instability 

• the expiration and nonrenewal of foreign tax rulings andor grants 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws and 

• economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations 

the ongoing global economic competition and trade tensions between the us and china present risk to medtronic although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact on medtronic from increased duties imposed by both sides through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions tariff exclusions awarded to medtronic by the us government require annual renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government 

table of contents 

procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect medtronic’s access to the markets china comprises approximately eight percent of our total revenues 

more generally several governments including the us have raised the possibility of policies to induce “reshoring” of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production examples include potential “buy america” requirements in the us or us withdrawal from the world trade organization agreement on government procurement gpa if such steps triggered retaliation in other markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the result could be a significant impact on medtronic 

other significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements or the final implementation of the “brexit” agreement between the united kingdom and european union may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition covid19 and the responses of business and governments to the pandemic have at times resulted in reduced availability of air transport port closures increased border controls or closures increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain and countries may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many healthcare industry companies including healthcare systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

healthcare industry costcontainment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components 

most of our customers and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals and gpos and idns have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies including us

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the eu if they had been made between member states of the eu this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan syria tunisia ukraine and zimbabwe 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 percent unless an exemption applies 

table of contents 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

• in the case of a beneficial owner of medtronic shares held in the depository trust company dtc the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the united states and this information is provided by the broker to the company’s qualifying intermediary or 

• in the case of a record owner the record owner has provided to the company’s transfer agent a valid us certification of residence form 6166 or valid irish nonresident form v2 

irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company the discussi on focuses on our financial results for the fiscal year ended april 30 2021 fiscal year 2021 and the fiscal year ended april 24 2020 fiscal year 2020 a discussion on our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared the year ended april 26 2019 fiscal year 2019 is included in part ii item 7 mana gements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended april 24 2020 filed with the sec on june 19 2020 and is incorporated by reference into this form 10k  you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 and for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 which are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands and therefore the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding additionally certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures and are intended to supplement and should not be considered as superior to financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we generally use nongaap financial measures to facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning we believe that nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the companys underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry 

as presented in the gaap to nongaap reconciliations section below our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the income tax provision adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows

executive level overview 

the global healthcare system faces an unprecedented challenge as a result of the covid19 pandemic covid19 had an adverse impact on certain aspects of our company and business including the demand for and supply of certain of our products operations supply chains and distribution systems impacts or delays to product development milestones clinical trials or regulatory clearances and approval timing most of our businesses were affected by a decline in procedural volumes as a result of covid19 largely during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2021 however we have seen a recovery in most of our businesses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021 from the depths of the pandemic that we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 

we expect medical procedure recovery rates to continue to vary by therapy and country and could be impacted by regional covid19 case volumes vaccine immunization rates and new covid19 variants as a result we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic or the impact it may have on our company

3 emerging markets include the countries of the middle east africa latin america eastern europe and the countries of asia that are not included in the nonus developed markets as defined above 

the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to the recovery of procedure volumes as compared to the drastic decline experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the pandemic while the recovery of procedural volumes has been uneven across geographies and our different product lines as of the end of fiscal year 2021 procedural volumes in the majority of our end markets are returning to prepandemic levels net sales for fiscal year 2021 were also impacted by an additional selling week during the first fiscal month of fiscal year 2021 due to our 5253 week fiscal year calendar although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of the extra selling week we estimate that it benefited net sales for fiscal year 2021 by approximately 360 million to 390 million additionally currency had a favorable impact on net sales in nonus developed markets of 427 million and an unfavorable impact on net sales in emerging markets of 98 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020

the charts below illustrate the percent of cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure crhf net sales increased 9 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 the increase was led by cardiac rhythm management and cardiac ablation solutions products which included strong growth from the micra leadless pacing system cobalt and crome icds and crtds tyrx antibacterial envelope and artic front advance cryoballons partially offsetting this growth were declines in mechanical circulatory support products driven by slower recovery of procedure volumes and competitive dynamics 

structural heart  aortic sha net sales were flat in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 as growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr nets sales were offset by net sales declines within our aortic and cardiac surgery businesses the growth experienced in tavr was driven by continued adoption of the evolut pro  valve the declines experienced in aortic and cardiac surgery were a result of slower recovery of procedure volumes as well our voluntary recall of the valiant navion thoracic stent graft system in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 

coronary  peripheral vascular cpv net sales decreased 5 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 the decline was a result of the generally more deferrable nature of peripheral and endovenous procedure categories as well as the negative impact of the chinese national tender on our drugeluting stent sales the chinese national tender went into effect in january 2021 and resulted in significant price declines for drugeluting stents in china which negatively impacted our coronary business partially offsetting these negative impacts was growth in drugcoated balloons and peripheral embolization

coils drugcoated balloon growth was the result of strong adoption of the inpact av drugcoated balloon driven by its pivotal data published during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 

in addition to the general impacts of covid19 on our company as described in the executive level overview looking ahead we expect cardiovascular could be affected by the following 

• continued growth of our micra transcatheter pacing system micra av received us fda approval and ce mark approval in january and april 2020 respectfully micra av expands the micra target population from 15 percent to 45 percent of pacemaker patients

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 

cost of products sold cost of products sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 105 billion and 94 billion respectively the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was largely due to increased expenses as a result of a full fiscal year impact of covid19 primarily due to period expensing of some of our fixed overhead costs due to idle capacity at certain manufacturing facilities and increases in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory as well as charges associated with recent field corrective actions going forward we will continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management manufacturing improvements and optimizing our manufacturing network 

research and development expense we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare 

in fiscal year 2021 we entered into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies in our diabetes segment as there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to the third parties the development funding provided is recognized as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is recorded as income in other operating expense net in the consolidated statements of income in the period the corresponding research and development expenses are incurred if the technologies receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized we will pay royalties to the third parties during fiscal year 2021 no projects were significant either individually or in aggregate to our consolidated results 

selling general and administrative expense our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives selling general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses 

selling general and administrative expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 101 billion the decrease in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to net sales growth coupled with reduced travel and discretionary spending due to the pandemic offset by higher annual incentive accruals and increased restructuring and associated costs selling general and administrative expense in fiscal year 2021 includes 196 million of restructuring and associated costs as compared to 168 million in fiscal year 2020 additionally for fiscal year 2020 selling general and administrative expense includes 103 million of acquisitionrelated costs as compared to 3 million for fiscal year 2021

enterprise excellence 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 we announced a multiyear global enterprise excellence program designed to drive longterm business growth and sustainable efficiency the enterprise excellence program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience 

the enterprise excellence program is focused on three objectives 

• global operations – integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes systems and site presence to improve quality delivery cost and cash flow 

• functional optimization – enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience 

• commercial optimization – optimizing certain processes systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience 

the enterprise excellence program is designed to drive operating margin improvement as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives with expected gross savings of more than 30 billion from cost reductions and leverage of our fixed infrastructure by the end of fiscal year 2022 approximately 500 million to 700 million of gross annual savings are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022 

the enterprise excellence program is expected to result in pretax restructuring charges of approximately 16 billion to 18 billion the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023 approximately 40 percent of estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits the remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program such as salaries and benefits for employees supporting the program including program management and transition teams and strategic and operational consulting services related to the three objectives of the program discussed above we expect these costs to be recognized within restructuring charges net cost of products sold and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

during fiscal year 2021 we recognized net charges of 349 million including 52 million recognized within restructuring charges net in the consolidated statements of income which were primarily comprised of employee termination benefits for fiscal year 2021 charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses including 128 million recognized within cost of products sold and 169 million recognized within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income

simplification 

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we initiated our simplification restructuring program designed to make the company a more nimble and competitive organization focused on accelerating innovation enhancing the customer experience driving revenue growth and winning market share while also more efficiently and effectively leveraging our enterprise scale under the oversight of the portfolio leaders this new operating model which became fully operational the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 will simplify our organizational structure and accelerate decisionmaking and execution primary activities of the restructuring program will include reorganizing our business into a portfoliolevel structure including the creation of highly focused accountable and empowered operating units ous consolidating operations at the enterprise level establishing technology development centers in areas where we have deep core technology competencies to be leveraged by multiple ous and forming dedicated sales organizations that leverage our scale but move with the same agility as our smaller local competitors 

the simplification program designed to streamline our operating model improve competitiveness and enhance the customer and employee experience will result in substantial reduction in selling general and administrative expenses the majority of which are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022 annual savings of approximately 450 million to 475 million are expected to be realized by the various components of the simplification program 

we estimate that in connection with the simplification restructuring program we will recognize pretax exit and disposal costs and other costs across all segments of approximately 400 million to 450 million the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 approximately three quarters of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits the remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses to execute the reorganization of our business into a portfoliolike structure as discussed above these charges are recognized within restructuring charges net and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

during fiscal year 2021 we recognized net charges of 268 million including 241 million within restructuring charges net in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year 2021 charges included 97 million of incremental defined benefit pension and postretirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages within restructuring charges net in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year 2021 charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses including 27 million recognized within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income

the increase in other operating expense net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by our remeasurement and hedging programs which combined resulted in a loss of 47 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of 295 million for fiscal year 2020 additionally for fiscal year 2021 other operating expense net includes a 132 million gain related to amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition and impairment charges of 76 million related to the abandonment of certain intangible assets also contributing to the increase were changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting in a loss of 36 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of 33 million for fiscal year 2020 for fiscal year 2020 other operating expense net includes an 80 million charge associated with a commitment to the medtronic foundation and charges of 52 million associated with the exit of businesses 

other nonoperating income net other nonoperating income net includes the nonservice components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost investment gains and losses and interest income 

the decrease in other nonoperating income net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest income as a result of the lower interest rate environment interest income was 192 million and 300 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively this decrease was partially offset by an increase in gains recognized on minority investments gains on minority investments were 61 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to losses of 19 million for fiscal year 2020

income taxes 



many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our us statutory rate thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the us statutory rate of 210 percent a significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in puerto rico switzerland and ireland the statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 125 percent to 4375 percent our earnings in puerto rico are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country’s statutory tax rates unless our tax incentive grants are extended they will expire between fiscal years 2022 and 2030 the tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2021 did not have a material impact on our financial results see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 68 percent as compared to 185 percent in fiscal year 2020 the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from certain tax adjustments and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 118 percent as compared to 143 percent in fiscal year 2020 the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2021 we recognized 51 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 46 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and a 5 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves legal entity reorganizations and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

during fiscal year 2020 we recognized 138 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 63 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and a 75 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 of approximately 68 million and 73 million respectively

• a benefit of 252 million related to tax legislative changes in switzerland which abolished certain preferential tax regimes the company benefited from and replaced them with a new set of internationally accepted measures the legislation provided for higher effective tax rates but allowed for a transitional period whereby an amortizable asset was created for swiss federal income tax purposes that will be amortized and deducted over a 10year period 

• a benefit of 658 million related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain net operating losses luxembourg enacted tax legislation during the year requiring the company to reassess the realizability of certain net operating losses the company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the utilization of certain net operating losses in connection with a planned intercompany sale of intellectual property 

• a net benefit of 269 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the establishment of a deferred tax asset

summary of cash flows 

the following is a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and the net change in cash and cash equivalents 



operating activities the 994 million decrease in net cash provided was primarily driven by a decrease in cash collected from customers and an increase in cash paid for income taxes partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to employees a decrease in payments made for employer taxes and a decrease in retirement benefit plan contributions the decrease in cash collected from customers was primarily related to covid19 driving decreased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and first quarter of fiscal year 2021 when compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to increased estimated federal tax payments and tax payments associated with irs audit settlements in fiscal year 2021 cash paid to employees decreased due to lower annual incentive plan payouts compared the prior fiscal year payments made for employer taxes decreased due to the deferral of payment on the companys share of social security taxes allowed by the cares act in the current fiscal year for information on retirement benefit plan contributions refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

investing activities the 337 million decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in net purchases of investments of 10 billion partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 506 million as compared to fiscal year 2020 

financing activities the 62 million decrease in net cash used included a number of largely offsetting items contributing to the decrease in cash used was a decrease in share repurchases of 674 million partially offsetting this decrease was a net decrease in shortterm borrowings of 294 million and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders of 226 million for fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were impacted by the mizuho bank term loan under which we borrowed ¥300 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 which was subsequently repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were also impacted by the issuance of 72 billion of eurodenominated senior notes offset by the early redemption of 60 billion of senior notes for 63 billion of total consideration and repayment of an additional 911 million of eurodenominated senior notes for comparison financing cash flows for fiscal year 2020 reflect the issuance of 56 billion of eurodenominated senior notes offset by the tender of 52 billion of senior notes for 56 billion of total consideration we also repaid 500 million of senior notes at maturity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 for more information on the aforementioned mizuho bank term loan and issuances and redemptions of senior notes refer to the debt and capital section

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt we primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and to a lesser extent bank borrowings from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 

table of contents 

total debt at april 30 2021 was 264 billion as compared to 248 billion at april 24 2020 the increase in total debt was primarily driven by fluctuations in exchange rates as it pertains to our eurodenominated senior notes and to a lesser extent the net impact of the issuance and redemption of senior notes both of which are described below 

in september 2020 we issued six tranches of eurodenominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of €63 billion with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2051 resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 72 billion net of discounts and issuance costs the eurodenominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our european operations we used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the early redemption of 60 billion of senior notes for 63 billion of total consideration in october 2020 additionally we used the proceeds to repay our €750 million floating rate senior notes at maturity in march 2021 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 308 million in fiscal year 2021 which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums the loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 

in may 2020 we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with mizuho bank ltd for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion or approximately 28 billion with a term of six months and the option to extend for an additional six months on may 13 2020 medtronic luxco borrowed the entire amount of the term loan under the loan agreement the proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes the japanese yen denominated debt was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our japanese operations on november 12 2020 we exercised our option to extend the term of the loan for an additional six months during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 we dedesignated the yen denominated debt as a net investment hedge and repaid the term loan in full including interest 

we repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders in march 2019 the companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of 60 billion of the companys ordinary shares there is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we repurchased a total of 4 million and 12 million shares respectively under these programs at an average price of 12680 and 10622 respectively at april 30 2021 we had approximately 54 billion remaining under the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors

liquidity 

our liquidity sources at april 30 2021 include 36 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 72 billion of current investments 

additionally we maintain commercial paper programs no commercial paper outstanding at april 30 2021 and a credit facility 

our investments primarily include availableforsale debt securities including us and nonus government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities and other assetbacked securities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our investments 

we maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for shortterm financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion at both april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 we had no commercial paper outstanding the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion fiveyear syndicated credit facility credit facility which expires in december 2025 the credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes the credit facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 10 billion at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date we could also request a oneyear extension of the maturity date at april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

interest rates on advances of our credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by standard  poors rating services sp and moodys investor service moody’s facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates we are in compliance with all covenants related to the credit facility 

table of contents 

the following table is a summary of our sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings 



1 agency ratings are subject to change and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings andor maintain its current ratings a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 30 2021 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 24 2020 we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet credit facility and related commercial paper programs

contractual obligations and cash requirements

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements 

table of contents 

note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested we expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future in addition we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

beyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures research and developments costs and other operational costs 

we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and our cash cash equivalents current investments credit facility and related commercial paper programs as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our current and future contractual obligations and cash requirements we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

acquisitions 

information regarding acquisitions is included in notes 3 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

litigation contingencies we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property and commercial disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations the outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

income tax reserves we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change 

table of contents 

in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets primarily include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participants view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value including projected future cash flows and discount rates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge currencies of our derivative instruments include the euro japanese yen chinese yuan and others fluctuations in the exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 was 147 billion and 119 billion respectively at april 30 2021 these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of 211 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies it would have the following impact on the fair value of these contracts 



any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 we began accounting for our operations in argentina as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent the change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year ended 2021 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio at april 30 2021 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars and the euro of which substantially all is fixed rate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities we enter into marketable debt security positions for cash management purposes 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest ratesensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates as compared to interest rates at april 30 2021 and april 24 2020 would have the following impact on the fair value of these instruments

other factors impacting our operations 

covid19 pandemic 

the global covid19 pandemic together with the preventative and precautionary measures taken by businesses communities and governments is impacting and we expect will continue to impact significant aspects of our company and business including demand for our products our operations supply chains and distribution systems and our ability to research and develop and bring new products and services to market see “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use and developing new therapies and procedures we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets clinical evidence generation and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary technology in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole 

we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time for additional information see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our four largest markets are the us western europe china and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products 

we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition industry and cost containment 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts results of clinical trials to support superiority claims and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private healthcare insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms hospitals which purchase our technology are also seeking to reduce 

costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example centralized purchasing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization this has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues earnings and cash flows from operations we use operational and economic hedges as well as derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however due to the us fda’s manufacturing requirements we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “item 2 properties” in this annual report on form 10k 

quality management and product liability 

our business success depends on the quality of our products and we have global processes procedures and programs including our “quality begins with me” program that are intended to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality in all products we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class 

working capital 

our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers 

employees 

on april 24 2020 we employed more than 90000 fulltime employees our employees are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months in the northern hemisphere due to summer vacation schedules particularly in european countries 

government regulation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european regulatory authorities such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices in germany the china national medical product administration nmpa  and other government agencies inside and outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing 

distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

product approval and monitoring 

many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance safety and quality of our products authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the us is generally obtained in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use this process is generally much more timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes the competent authorities of the eu countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market a new medical device regulation was published by the eu in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements eu mdr the regulation initially provided a threeyear implementation period to may 2020 but that timeline has been delayed to may 2021 due to covid19 and its impact on audits and technical file review by notified bodies after that time medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements except that devices with valid ce certificates issued pursuant to the medical device directives before may 2020 can be placed on the market until may 2024 

the global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact the cost the time needed to approve and ultimately our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products regulations of the us fda and other regulatory agencies in and outside the us impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business these agencies review our design and manufacturing practices labeling record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other regulatory bodies both in and outside the us including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the promotion and advertising of our products any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation s 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our pain therapies divisions synchromed ii drug infusion system and its associated quality system the consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system were lifted by the us fda in september 2017 following the successful completion of the required thirdparty expert audits and subsequent fda inspection and in coordination with the fda medtronic can move to have the consent decree vacated the company must undergo thirdparty audits and submit audit reports to the us fda through calendar 2020 

in june 2016 tyrx received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey the us fda completed its follow up inspection to the warning letter in march 2018 and issued a form483 with observations fda completed its warning letter reinspection at the tyrx facility in minneapolis since the manufacturing operations at monmouth junction have ceased the inspection concluded in march 2020 with zero observations and in april 2020 the warning letter was lifted by fda in june 2014 heartware inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the heartware facility in miami lakes florida medtronic acquired heartware in august 2016 and implemented corrective actions and process improvements to address the items in the warning letter in july 2018 heartware received a form483 after a us fda inspection and is implementing additional corrective actions primarily related to the pioneer 20 controller in response to the observations we have been communicating monthly with the us fda on the progress of the actions and the timing for reinspection in august 2018 we received two fda warning letters one 

issued to the crhf facility in mounds view mn and the other issued to the juncos facility in puerto rico the letters were limited to the blackwell icd and focused on the manufacturing and design processes for blackwell reinspection was completed at juncos in november 2019 and resulted in four 483 observations reinspection was completed at mounds view in january 2020 and resulted in zero 483 observations both the juncos and mounds view warning letters were lifted in february 2020 

trade regulations 

the movement of products services and investment across borders subject us to extensive trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders these laws and regulations govern among other things our import export and other business activities we are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if we or the third parties through which we do business are not in compliance with applicable import export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs new compliance challenges and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

for example in the us the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers privacy and security rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and by their “business associates” which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce rules under hipaa and hitech include specific security standards and breach notification requirements the us department of health and human services hhs through the office of civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to both the security and privacy rules including civil and criminal liability with the exception of certain of its operations in its diabetes and care management services businesses medtronic is generally not a covered entity medtronic also operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances there are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by healthcare providers and medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses 

in addition to the regulation of personal health information a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data state consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers 

outside the us we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international national and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customers in more than 150 countries legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve 

with increasingly strict enforcement regimes more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalties in the eu stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in may 2018 the eu general data protection regulation gdpr applies uniformly across the eu and includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services 

us federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federallyfunded healthcare programs including laws related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other healthcare programs and private thirdparty payers in some circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them further as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” the us is implementing valuebased payment methodologies and seeking to create alternate payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered together with all the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the sec furthermore additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business our business financial condition operating results cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties 

risks relating to the company 

the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

our global operations and interactions with healthcare systems providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 in particular the continuing global spread of covid19 including corresponding preventative and precautionary measures that we and other businesses communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread of the disease has led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on business and personal activities further in addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020 countries states and governments may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines or other restrictions and requirements on travel and further limit our ability to conduct business inperson as we did prior to covid19 requiring businesses including our business to use alternative methods of communication it is likely the covid19 pandemic will cause an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration and it is possible that it could cause a global recession 

together with the preventative and precautionary measures being taken as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new and different methods of communication and conducting business covid19 is having and will likely continue to have an adverse impact on significant aspects of our company and business including on demand for and supply of our products operations supply chains and distribution systems our ability to research and develop and bring to market new products and services and our ability to generate cash flow and may have an adverse impact on our ability to access capital some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in deferrable and emergent medical procedures and as hospital systems prioritize treatment of covid19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines certain medical procedures have been suspended or postponed in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold which has caused a reduction in sales of these products the company has certain product lines that are in higher demand as a result of covid19 such as ventilators pulse oximetry capnography advanced parameter monitoring and extracorporeal life support products it is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of deferrable medical procedures and to the extent individuals and hospital systems continue to deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures or if unemployment or loss of insurance coverage adversely impacts an individual’s ability to pay for our products and services our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected further the covid19 pandemic is straining hospital systems around the world resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems that could result in reduced future expenditures for capital equipment and other products and services we provide as well as disruption of product launches of our recently approved products clinical trials generally have suspended enrollment due to facility closures and governmental restrictions which we expect will delay the results from those clinical trials and will impact our ability to timely develop and bring to market new products 

in addition a significant number of our global suppliers vendors distributors and manufacturing facilities have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including by adversely impacting the ability of their employees to get to their places of work and maintain the continuity of their onsite operations these impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers and any such delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability 

in addition covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and capital markets including by negatively impacting demand for a number of our products access to capital markets including the commercial paper market foreign 

currency exchange rates and interest rates each of which may adversely impact our business and liquidity we could experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers suppliers and vendors facing liquidity issues as a result we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow 

in addition covid19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex productions and operations including our executive officers and other members of our management team as well as the ability of our thirdparty suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors to retain their key employees to the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by covid19 and are not available to perform their job duties we could experience delays in or the suspension of our manufacturing operations research and product development activities regulatory work streams clinical development programs and other important commercial functions 

while the impact of covid19 has had and we expect it to continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain and unpredictable 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

• product performance and reliability 

• product technology and innovation 

• product quality and safety 

• breadth of product lines 

• product support services 

• customer support 

• costeffectiveness and price 

• reimbursement approval from healthcare insurance providers and 

• changes to the regulatory environment 

competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies from time to time we have lost and may in the future lose market share in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products which highlights the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems to our business in the current environment of managed care consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price further our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop acquire and market new and differentiated products technologies and intellectual property and as a result we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success 

reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture the majority of our products and procure important thirdparty services such as sterilization services at numerous facilities worldwide we purchase many of 

the components raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials components and services however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain components raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these components raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies including the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources furthermore the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and could result in lost sales 

other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes or wildfires property damage from riots and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and actions by businesses communities and governments in response could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation for example in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing processes and we are currently adversely impacted by and expect to continue to be adversely impacted by the global covid19 pandemic and the responses of governments and of our partners including suppliers manufacturers distributors and other businesses furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities such as the damage caused by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility a thirdparty may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices and technologies as well as our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance it may 

• take a significant amount of time 

• require the expenditure of substantial resources 

• involve stringent clinical and preclinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillance 

• involve modifications repairs or replacements of our products and 

• limit the proposed uses of our products 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under the us fda and other applicable nonus government agency regulations for instance many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with applicable regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor 

require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda and other nonus government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations furthermore we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we cannot predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigations any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs andor entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligations these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

governmental regulations outside the us have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and common in the european union for example a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which when it enters into force in may 2021 will include significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for regulatory noncompliance could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and healthcare fraud many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers in certain circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

we are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets or agreements such as employee nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts reputational harm adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients and the serious and potentially costly consequences of product failure our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing nonconformances design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products if they were to occur could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future further we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed manufactured andor marketed in response to the covid19 pandemic and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with covid19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions product defects or related claims as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

any of the foregoing problems including future product liability claims or recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives which requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by several governments regulators and thirdparty payers globally including the us federal and state governments to control these costs and more generally to reform healthcare systems including us healthcare reform legislation certain of these proposals could among other things limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for certain of our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers on our customers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

we develop manufacture distribute and sell our products globally we intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the us especially in emerging markets operations in different countries including emerging markets could expose us to additional and greater risks and potential costs including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• healthcare reform legislation 

• the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• longerterm receivables than are typical in the us 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other border taxes and import or export licensing requirements 

• less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the us than exists in the us 

• different labor regulations and workforce instability 

• political and economic instability 

• the expiration and nonrenewal of foreign tax rulings andor grants 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws and 

• economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuations 

the escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the us and china present risk to medtronic although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact on medtronic from increased duties imposed by both sides through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions tariff exclusions awarded to medtronic by the us government require annual renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect medtronic’s access to the markets china comprises approximately seven percent of our total revenues 

more generally several governments including the us have raised the possibility of policies to induce “reshoring” of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production one example would be stronger “buy america” requirements in the us or us withdrawal from the world trade organization agreement on government procurement gpa if such steps triggered retaliation in other markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the result could be a significant impact on medtronic 

other significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements or the final terms of the “brexit” arrangement between the united kingdom and european union may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition covid19 and the responses of business and governments to covid19 have resulted in reduced availability of air transport port closures increased border controls or closures increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain and countries may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with anticorruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the irish criminal justice corruption offences act 2018 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentadministered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws we also participate in publicprivate partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased in recent years including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors we maintain policies and programs to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and to prevent and prohibit improper practices however existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries governments entities and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many healthcare industry companies including healthcare systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

healthcare industry costcontainment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components 

most of our customers and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals and gpos and idns have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies including us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations and those of certain thirdparty suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of 

site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with healthcare professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic our access to these professionals has been limited and travel restrictions shutdowns and similar measures have impacted our ability to maintain these relationships thereby affecting our ability to develop market and sell new and improved products if we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on the proper function security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business and a breach cyberattack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position  

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business including to process transmit and store sensitive data and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to our systems like other large multinational corporations we could experience and in the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems as well as data breaches such as cyberattacks malicious intrusions breakdowns interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions furthermore we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems these thirdparty systems could also become vulnerable to cyberattack malicious intrusions breakdowns interference or other significant disruptions and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and as a result may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems 

our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “item 1 business  other factors impacting our operations  data privacy and security laws and regulations  for example gdpr requires us to manage personal data in the eu and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations furthermore there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyberattacks any data security breaches cyberattacks malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies andor civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future further a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic and related government actions which could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technologies systems 

if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality and we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

at april 24 2020 we had approximately 28 billion of current debt obligations and 220 billion of longterm debt outstanding we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on floating rate borrowings is variable 

our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully as well as liabilities or claims relating to such acquired businesses could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business further acquired businesses may have liabilities or be subject to claims litigation or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls andor significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies 

• our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner 

• liabilities claims litigation investigations or other adverse developments relating to acquired businesses or the business practices of acquired companies including investigations by governmental entities potential fcpa or product liability claims or other unanticipated liabilities 

• any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices including price increases 

• our ability to retain key employees and 

• the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 

we also could experience negative effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us ireland and various other jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with the us taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the us corporate tax rate the us treasury is expected to issue additional subsequent guidance and interpretation of the tax act this guidance could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in 2013 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published an action plan called base erosion and profit shifting beps with a view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authorities and their respective approach to international tax matters the final beps action plan was published in october 2015 and subsequent to this many taxing authorities have adopted the guidelines provided within their local laws the eu expanded upon these guidelines with the antitax avoidance directive atad 1  2 to be applied by all member states by 2020 the oecd announced its intention to expand the scope of beps in march 2018 and in january 2019 they issued a short policy note that announced agreement on the way forward for developing a long term solution to the tax challenges thrown up by the global digital economy and is commonly referred to as beps20 the oecd has set a very aggressive timetable for releasing final agreed beps20 guidelines on taxing the digital economy for december 2020 the proposals as currently drafted are very wide ranging and could affect all multinational enterprises across all industries without regard to their level of engagement with the digital economy the aggressive nature of the timeline set by the oecd may mean that all implications for business may not have been fully worked through or fully understood by the oecd before final guidelines are issued we continue to monitor any and all implications potentially resulting from this guidance this action together with other legislative changes on the mandatory sharing of company information financial and operational with taxing authorities on a local and global basis under various information sharing initiatives could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing sites an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because medtronic plc is organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the covidien transaction held 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law medtronic plc should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly at our 2019 annual general meeting our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary 

shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 10 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders provided that with respect to 5 of such shares such allotment is to be used for the purposes of a specified capital investment both of these authorizations will expire on june 6 2021 unless renewed by shareholders for a further period we anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2020 annual general meeting and in subsequent years we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold which irish revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the eu if they had been made between member states of the eu this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan syria tunisia ukraine and zimbabwe 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 25 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

• in the case of a beneficial owner of medtronic shares held in the depository trust company dtc the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the united states and this information is provided by the broker to the company’s qualifying intermediary or 

• in the case of a record owner the record owner has provided to the company’s transfer agent a valid us certification of residence form 6166 or valid irish nonresident form v2 

irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 and for each of the three fiscal years ended april 24 2020 fiscal year 2020 april 26 2019 fiscal year 2019 and april 27 2018 fiscal year 2018 which are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures and are intended to supplement and should not be considered as superior to financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we generally use nongaap financial measures to facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning we believe that nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the companys underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry 

as presented in the gaap to nongaap reconciliations section below our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the income tax provision adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows

executive level overview 

medtronic is among the worlds largest medical technology services and solutions companies  alleviating pain restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders cardiovascular disease advanced and general surgical care respiratory and monitoring solutions renal care neurological disorders spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma urological and digestive disorders and ear nose and throat and diabetes conditions 

the global healthcare system is facing an unprecedented challenge as a result of the covid19 pandemic covid19 or the pandemic the company’s top priority during this pandemic has been to ensure the health and wellbeing of our more than 90000 employees and their families around the globe in addition the company is focused on fulfilling our mission and getting our products and therapies to those who need them by rapidly expanding the production and distribution of critical products in the fight against covid19 including dramatically increased ventilator production and partnering with key government authorities to allocate our ventilators to the communities that need them most in fiscal year 2020 sales of airway and ventilator products represented approximately ten percent of the minimally invasive therapies groups net sales medtronic has been supporting our communities during this time of need by among other things providing direct support in the form of donations of certain products and we made an 80 million contribution to the medtronic foundation during fiscal year 2020 which has provided direct financial assistance to communities around the world 

covid19 is having and will likely continue to have an adverse impact on significant aspects of our company and business including the demand for our products our operations supply chains and distribution systems and our ability to research and develop and bring to market new products and services almost all of our businesses have been affected by a decline in procedure volumes as a result of covid19 as hospital resources have been diverted to fight the pandemic and many government agencies in conjunction with healthcare systems have made decisions to postpone many deferrable and semideferrable procedures that use our products in addition some people are avoiding seeking treatment for noncovid19 emergency procedures resulting in an impact to those emergent product lines it is not possible to accurately predict the timing of a broad resumption of deferrable medical procedures and to the extent individuals and hospital systems continue to deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected 

further covid19 is straining hospital systems around the world resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced future expenditures for capital equipment and other products and services we provide the company has experienced recent changes in customer buying patterns as customers have prioritized preservation of cash and reduced their holdings of certain purchased product inventories especially in more deferrable procedure categories as covid19 continues to impact hospital systems and other customers we may encounter higher inventory levels which could result in inventory obsolescence due to excess andor expired inventory additionally the pandemics impact on our customers may adversely impact the collectability of our current and future accounts receivable balance covid19 has also disrupted and may continue to disrupt our product launches for our recently approved products and may negatively impact the regulatory approval of new products clinical trials generally have suspended enrollment due to facility closures and governmental restrictions which we expect will delay the results from those clinical trials and will impact our ability to timely bring new products to market 

in addition a significant number of our global suppliers vendors and distributors have been adversely affected by covid19 including an adverse impact on the ability of their employees to get to their places of work and maintain the continuity of their onsite operations therefore although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of certain components raw materials and services has been and may continue to be interrupted in certain instances as a direct result of covid19 

as of the june 19 2020 filing date of this annual report on form 10k which is in the middle of our first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we are starting to see signs of medical procedure recovery in certain geographies and across certain therapies we expect medical procedure recovery rates to vary by therapy and country and to be impacted by covid19 case volumes hospital and clinical occupancy and staffing levels patient’s willingness to rebook previously deferred procedures travel restrictions transportation limitations quarantine restrictions and potential covid19 resurgence 

the following is a summary of revenue diluted earnings per share and cash flow for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations the tables below present reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with us gaap for fiscal years 2020 and 2019

net sales 

segment and division 

the table below illustrates net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 



the decrease in net sales for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily attributable to the decline in procedure volume and to a lesser extent changing customer buying patterns resulting from the impact of covid19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 changing customer buying patterns were primarily experienced in the cardiac rhythm  heart failure business and to a lesser extent in the restorative therapies group with our biologics business in spine and our pain therapies business 

we remain focused against our three growth strategies therapy innovation globalization and economic value we continue to allocate our capital to higher growth markets and new opportunities that create competitive advantages and capitalize on the longterm trends in healthcare namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes the growing demand for expanded access to care and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems 

we continue to see an acceleration in our innovation cycle within our therapy innovation growth strategy our segments invest in a pipeline of groundbreaking medical technology we remain focused on our globalization strategy as our emerging markets continue to benefit from geographic diversification with balanced results around the world finally in our third growth strategy economic value we continue to execute our valuebased healthcare signature programs and develop unique valuebased healthcare solutions that directly link our therapies to improving outcomes while delivering improved economic value to 

the payers and providers we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

litigation contingencies we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property and commercial disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations the outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

income tax reserves we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable certain positions may be challenged and we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets primarily include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participants view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value including projected future cash flows and discount rates

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales dollar amounts in millions 

cost of products sold we continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management manufacturing improvements and optimizing our manufacturing network cost of products sold was 94 billion and 92 billion during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was largely due to increased expenses as a result of covid19 including expanded manufacturing facility cleaning increased protective equipment bonuses for our factory employees and higher freight and obsolescence charges as well as negative impact from mix as products in higher demand carried lower margin additionally the increase was driven by increased restructuring and associated costs and increased duty driven in part by increased china tariffs on inbound products cost of products sold for fiscal year 2020 includes 155 million of restructuring and associated costs as compared to 91 million for fiscal year 2019 

research and development expense we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare research and development expense was 23 billion during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 

selling general and administrative expense our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions selling general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and divestiturerelated expenses 

selling general and administrative expense was 101 billion and 104 billion during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to the deleveraging experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of covid19 the increase in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is also attributable to the increase in restructuring and associated costs selling general and administrative expense in fiscal year 2020 includes 168 million of restructuring and associated costs as compared to 118 million in fiscal year 2019 these increases were partially offset by savings from our enterprise excellence program and cost containment measures and decreased variable compensation costs 

the following is a summary of other costs and expenses 



amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definitelived intangible assets consisting of purchased patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and other intangible assets amortization expense was 18 billion during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 

restructuring charges net 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 we announced a multiyear global enterprise excellence program designed to drive longterm business growth and sustainable efficiency the enterprise excellence program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience 

the enterprise excellence program is focused on three objectives 

• global operations  integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes systems and site presence to improve quality delivery cost and cash flow

income taxes 



many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our blended us statutory rate thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the us statutory rate of 210 percent a significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in puerto rico switzerland and ireland the statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 125 percent to 4375 percent our earnings in puerto rico are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than 

the country’s statutory tax rates unless our tax incentive grants are extended they will expire between fiscal years 2021 and 2030 the tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2020 did not have a material impact on our financial results see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was 185 percent as compared to 105 percent in fiscal year 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from certain tax adjustments the impact from investment losses and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was 143 percent as compared to 136 percent in fiscal year 2019 the increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to the yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2020 we recognized 138 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 63 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and a 75 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

during fiscal year 2019 we recognized 134 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 50 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and an 84 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of approximately 73 million and 82 million respectively 

certain tax adjustments 

during fiscal year 2020 certain tax adjustments of 12 billion recognized in income tax benefit provision in the consolidated statement of income included the following 

• a net benefit of 63 million related to the finalization of certain state tax impacts from us tax reform and the issuance of certain final us treasury regulations associated with us tax reform the primary impact of these regulations resulted in the company reestablishing its permanently reinvested assertion on certain foreign earnings and reversing the previously accrued tax liability this benefit was partially offset by additional tax associated with a previously executed internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries 

• a benefit of 252 million related to tax legislative changes in switzerland which abolished certain preferential tax regimes the company benefited from and replaced them with a new set of internationally accepted measures the legislation provided for higher effective tax rates but allowed for a transitional period whereby an amortizable asset was created for swiss federal income tax purposes which will be amortized and deducted over a 10year period 

• a benefit of 658 million related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain net operating losses luxembourg enacted tax legislation during the year which required the company to reassess the realizability of certain net operating losses the company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the utilization of certain net operating losses in connection with a planned intercompany sale of intellectual property 

• a net benefit of 269 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the establishment of a deferred tax asset 

during fiscal year 2019 certain tax adjustments of 40 million recognized in income tax benefit provision in the consolidated statement of income included the following 

• a net benefit of 30 million associated with the finalization of the transition tax liability and the tax act impact to deferred tax assets liabilities and valuation allowances 

• a charge of 42 million related to the recognition of a prepaid tax expense resulting from the reduction in the us statutory tax rate under the tax act and the current year sale of us manufactured inventory held as of april 27 2018 

• a benefit of 32 million related to intercompany legal entity restructuring 

• a net benefit of 20 million associated with the finalization of certain income tax aspects of the divestiture 

certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider these nongaap adjustments refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion of these adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

we are currently in a strong financial position despite the impact from covid19 we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and our cash cash equivalents and current investments as well as our credit facility and related commercial paper programs outlined below will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs we believe we have ample liquidity with 109 billion of cash and investments as of april 24 2020 and an undrawn 35 billion credit facility furthermore we have no public debt maturing until march 2021 given our strong financial position we are continuing to focus on making capital allocation decisions to drive our longterm strategies 

our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process we consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations which includes working capital needs investments in research and development property plant and equipment and other operating costs we also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases satisfying maturing debt and acquiring businesses and technology 

summary of cash flows 

the following is a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and the net change in cash and cash equivalents 



operating activities the 227 million increase in net cash provided was primarily driven by a decrease in cash paid for income taxes interest and certain litigation payments partially offset by an increase in retirement benefit plan contributions cash paid for enterprise excellence restructuring activities and an increase in cash paid to employees the decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in estimated federal tax payments as well as a tax payment associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a lower transition tax payment made in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 cash paid for interest decreased due to a decrease in interest expense and change in timing of interest payments resulting from the debt tenders and issuances in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 certain litigation payments decreased primarily due to the payment of previously accrued settlement amounts for the infuse litigation matter in fiscal year 2019 cash paid to employees increased due to higher annual incentive plan payouts in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 covid19 did not have a significant impact on our cash collected from customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to the timing of the pandemic within the quarter and our normal cash collection cycle lag looking forward we anticipate a decrease in cash collected from customers in fiscal year 2021 due to the decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 resulting from covid19 and potential ongoing impacts of the pandemic on sales 

for information on retirement benefit plan contributions refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k refer to the restructuring charges net section of this managements discussion and analysis and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial 

statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for information on the enterprise excellence program 

investing activities the 24 billion increase in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from purchases and sales of investments of 36 billion and an increase in cash paid for additions of property plant and equipment of 79 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 13 billion as compared to fiscal year 2019 

financing activities the 12 billion decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in net cash used for share repurchases of 16 billion and a net decrease in repayments of shortterm borrowings of 696 million partially offset by a decrease in the issuance of ordinary shares of 330 million as compared to fiscal year 2019 financing cash flows were also impacted by the debt tenders and issuances in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 as well as payment of notes at maturity in both periods in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we issued 56 billion of eurodenominated senior notes offset by the tender of 52 billion of senior notes for 56 billion of total consideration we also repaid 500 million of senior notes at maturity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 we issued 78 billion of eurodenominated senior notes offset by the tender of 64 billion of senior notes for 69 billion of total consideration we also repaid 10 billion of senior notes at maturity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 

free cash flow 

free cash flow a nongaap financial measure is calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs current debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations at april 24 2020 was 28 billion as compared to 838 million at april 26 2019 longterm debt at april 24 2020 was 220 billion as compared to 245 billion at april 26 2019 we utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our longterm financing needs from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 

total debt at april 24 2020 was 248 billion as compared to 253 billion at april 26 2019 the decrease in total debt was primarily driven by the payment of 500 million of fiveyear floating rate senior notes and the issuance and cash tender offers described below 

in june 2019 we issued six tranches of eurodenominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of €50 billion with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2050 resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 56 billion net of discounts and issuance costs we used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cash tender offer and early redemption described below the eurodenominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our european operations 

we completed the cash tender offer of 46 billion of senior notes for 50 billion of total consideration in july 2019 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 413 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums the loss on debt extinguishment also included a 16 million charge for the estimated early redemption premium for 533 million of senior notes which were redeemed in august 2019 the loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 

in may 2020 subsequent to fiscal year 2020 we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with mizuho bank ltd for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion or approximately 28 billion with a term of six months which may be 

extended for an additional six months at the company’s option on may 13 2020 medtronic luxco borrowed the entire amount of the term loan under the loan agreement the proceeds of the loan will be used for general corporate purposes 

for additional information on debt issuance transactions and the cash tender offers and early redemption refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the eurodenominated debt designated as a net investment hedge refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

we maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for shortterm financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion at both april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 we had no commercial paper outstanding the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion fiveyear syndicated credit facility credit facility which expires in december 2024 the credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes the credit facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 10 billion at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date we could also request a oneyear extension of the maturity date at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

interest rates on advances of our credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp and moodys refer to the liquidity section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we were in compliance with at april 24 2020 

we repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders in june 2017 our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to 50 billion for new share repurchases in march 2019 our board of directors authorized an incremental 60 billion for repurchase of our ordinary shares there is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 we repurchased a total of 12 million and 31 million shares respectively under these programs at an average price of 10622 and 9143 respectively at april 24 2020 we had approximately 60 billion remaining under the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors we temporarily halted repurchases of ordinary shares as a result of our reprioritization of capital deployment due to covid19 and made no share repurchases in march and april of fiscal year 2020 looking forward we expect to continue to deprioritize share repurchases in our capital allocation priorities

liquidity 

our liquidity sources at april 24 2020 include 41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 68 billion of current investments additionally we maintain commercial paper programs no commercial paper outstanding at april 24 2020 and a credit facility see discussion above regarding changes in our cash and cash equivalents commercial paper programs and credit facility 

our investments include availableforsale debt securities including us and nonus government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand for fiscal year 2020 the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recognized all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost at april 24 2020 we have 141 million of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate availableforsale debt securities of 68 billion if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary impairment in the future which could adversely affect our financial results there were no significant otherthantemporary impairments at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 we are required to use estimates and assumptions in our valuation of investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual results could differ materially from estimates see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the following table is a summary of our standard and poors rating services sp and moodys investors service moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings 



1 agency ratings are subject to change and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings andor maintain its current ratings a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 24 2020 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 26 2019 we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet credit facility and related commercial paper programs 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows refer to the offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations section of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on these obligations and commitments

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested we removed our permanently reinvested assertion on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries with a us parent which were subject to the transition tax and all earnings of these subsidiaries through april 27 2018 we have reasserted for certain earnings of such subsidiaries through april 27 2018 which were not subject to the transition tax we expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future in addition we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and our cash cash equivalents and current investments as well as our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the euro japanese yen chinese yuan and others fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 was 119 billion and 111 billion respectively at april 24 2020 these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of 384 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies it would have the following impact on the fair value of these contracts 



any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 we began accounting for our operations in argentina as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent the change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year ended 2020 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio at april 24 2020 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars and the euro of which substantially all is fixed rate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest ratesensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates as compared to interest rates at april 24 2020 and april 26 2019 would have the following impact on the fair value of these instruments

other factors impacting our operations 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products are necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use and developing new therapies and procedures we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets clinical evidence generation and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of 

material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole 

we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time for additional information see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns primarily through thirdparty distributors although we also have direct sales representatives we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our four largest markets are the us western europe japan and china emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products 

we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition industry and cost containment 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms hospitals which purchase implants are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example centralized purchasing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues earnings and cash flows from operations we use operational and economic hedges as well as derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and 

cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however due to the us fda’s manufacturing requirements we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “item 2 properties” in this annual report on form 10k 

quality management and product liability 

our business success depends on the quality of our products and we have global processes procedures and programs including our “quality begins with me” program that are intended to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality in all products we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class 

working capital 

our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers 

employees 

on april 26 2019  we employed more than 90000 fulltime employees our employees are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months in the northern hemisphere due to summer vacation schedules particularly in european countries 

government regulation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european regulatory authorities such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices in germany the china food and drug administration cfda and other government agencies inside and outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

product approval and monitoring 

many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance safety and quality of our products authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the us is generally obtained in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use this process is generally much more timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process 

in the european union eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes the competent authorities of the eu countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market a new medical device regulation was published by the eu in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the regulation has a threeyear implementation period to may 2020 after that time medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements except that devices with valid ce certificates issued pursuant to the medical device directives before may 2020 can be placed on the market until may 2024 

the global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact the cost the time needed to approve and ultimately our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products regulations of the us fda and other regulatory agencies in and outside the us impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business these agencies review our design and manufacturing practices labeling record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other regulatory bodies both in and outside the us including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the promotion and advertising of our products any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation s 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our pain therapies divisions synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system were lifted by the us fda in september 2017 following the successful completion of the required thirdparty expert audits and in coordination with the fda the consent decree will be vacated the company must undergo thirdparty audits and submit audit reports to the us fda through 2020 

in june 2016 tyrx received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey the us fda completed its follow up inspection to the warning letter in march 2018 and issued a form483 with observations although the us fda noted in its closing meeting that there had been significant improvements made since the prior inspection we have completed the commitments under the form483 and have been communicating to the us fda on the progress the next step will be to signal readiness for inspection which will occur at the medtronic rice creek facility in minneapolis now that the manufacturing operations at monmouth junction have ceased in june 2014 heartware inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the heartware facility in miami lakes florida medtronic acquired heartware in august 2016 and implemented corrective actions and process improvements to address the items in the warning letter in july 2018 heartware received a form483 after a us fda inspection and is implementing additional corrective actions primarily related to the pioneer 20 controller in response to the observations we have been communicating monthly with the us fda on the progress of the actions in august 2018 we received two fda warning letters one issued to the crhf facility in mounds view mn and the other issued to the juncos facility in puerto rico the letters were limited to the blackwell icd and focused on the manufacturing and design processes for blackwell medtronic has been working with the us fda on resolving the open items and continues to make steady progress on implementing corrective actions after the actions are complete the us fda will perform a reinspection in order to lift the warning letters 

trade regulations 

the movement of products services and investment across borders subject us to extensive trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders these laws and regulations govern among other things our import export and other business activities we are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if we or the third 

parties through which we do business are not in compliance with applicable import export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs new compliance challenges and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

for example in the us the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers privacy and security rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims health plans and health care clearinghouses and by their “business associates” which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce rules under hipaa and hitech include specific security standards and breach notification requirements the us department of health and human services hhs through the office of civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to both the security and privacy rules including civil and criminal liability with the exception of certain of its operations in its diabetes and care management services businesses medtronic is generally not a covered entity medtronic also operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances there are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers and medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses 

in addition to the regulation of personal health information a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data state consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers 

outside the us we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international national and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customers in more than 150 countries legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalties in the eu stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in may 2018 the eu general data protection regulation gdpr applies uniformly across the eu and includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federallyfunded health care programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services 

us federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federallyfunded health care programs including laws related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and health care fraud there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other health care programs and private thirdparty payers in some circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them further as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” the us is implementing valuebased payment methodologies and seeking to create alternate payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered together with all the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the sec furthermore additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business our business financial condition operating results cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties 

risks relating to the company 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies from time to time we have lost and may in the future lose market share in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products which highlights the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems to our business in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price further our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop acquire and market new and differentiated products technologies and intellectual property and as a result we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success 

reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture the majority of our products and procure important thirdparty services such as sterilization services at numerous facilities worldwide we purchase many of the components raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials components and services however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain components raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these components raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies including the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources furthermore the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and could result in lost sales 

other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures supplier facility shutdowns defective raw materials natural 

disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes or wildfires and other environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation for example in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing processes furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities such as the damage caused by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility a thirdparty may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices and technologies as well as our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance it may 

 both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under the us fda and other applicable nonus government agency regulations for instance many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with applicable regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda and other nonus government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations furthermore we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we cannot predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigations any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs andor entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligations these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

governmental regulations outside the us have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and common in the european union for example a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which when it enters into full force in 2020 will include significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for regulatory noncompliance could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental health care programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and health care fraud many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers in certain circumstances insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

we are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and these licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts reputational harm adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing nonconformances design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products if they were to occur could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

any of the foregoing problems including future product liability claims or recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives which requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

health care policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government state governments regulators and thirdparty payers to control these costs and more generally to reform the health care system including us health care reform legislation certain of these proposals could among other things limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers on our customers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

we develop manufacture distribute and sell our products globally operations in countries outside of the us are accompanied by certain risks we intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the us especially in emerging markets which could expose us to additional and greater risks our profitability and global operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

 on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government began negotiations with the eu on the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu brexit was due to take place on march 29 2019 however the inability to agree on the exact terms of the future relationship have delayed brexit and led to continued uncertainty about brexit’s potential impacts on the company it is possible that as a result of brexit there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities that could adversely impact the company similarly from time to time proposals are made in the us to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the us and other countries although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented over time changes to global trade policy including between the us and other countries such as china and mexico may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with anticorruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the irish criminal justice corruption offences act 2018 and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentadministered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws we also participate in publicprivate partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased in recent years with more frequent voluntary selfdisclosures by companies aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by us and nonus governmental agencies and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors it is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices however existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many health care industry companies including health care systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

health care industry costcontainment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components 

most of our customers and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that health care providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals and gpos and idns have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies including us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations and those of certain thirdparty suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations 

primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers if we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on the proper function security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business and a breach cyberattack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position  

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business including to process transmit and store sensitive data and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to our systems like other large multinational corporations we could experience and in the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems as well as data breaches such as cyberattacks malicious intrusions breakdowns interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions furthermore we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems these thirdparty systems could also become vulnerable to cyberattack malicious intrusions breakdowns interference or other significant disruptions and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and as a result may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems 

our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “item 1 business  other factors impacting our operations  data privacy and security laws and regulations  for example gdpr requires us to manage personal data in the eu and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations furthermore there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyberattacks any data security breaches cyberattacks malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies andor civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep 

pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 

if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality and we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

at april 26 2019 we had approximately 08 billion of current debt obligations and 245 billion of longterm debt outstanding we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

 we also could experience negative effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us ireland and various other jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with the us taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the us corporate tax rate the us treasury is expected to issue additional subsequent guidance and interpretation of the tax act this guidance could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the government in switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation the results of which could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in 2013 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published an action plan called base erosion and profit shifting beps with a view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authorities and their approach to international tax matters the final beps action report was published in october 2015 and subsequently many taxing authorities have adopted the guidelines provided within their local laws the eu expanded upon these guidelines with antitax avoidance directives atad 1 and 2 to be applied by all its member states by 2020 we continue to monitor any and all changes to local country legislation resulting from this guidance one specific change is a requirement for increased disclosures of financial information on a local and global basis this information could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing sites an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because medtronic plc is organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the covidien transaction held 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s 

shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law medtronic plc should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly our articles of association contain as permitted by irish company law provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares and to disapply statutory preemption rights the authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years and our current authorizations are due to expire in january 2020 we anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2019 annual general meeting and in subsequent years we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold which irish revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents

the company’s ordinary shares are listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “mdt” 

the following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 

in june 2017 the companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of 50 billion of the company’s ordinary shares this authorization replaced the previous june 2015 repurchase authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares in march 2019 the companys board of directors authorized an incremental 60 billion for repurchase of the companys ordinary shares there is no specific timeperiod associated with these repurchase authorizations 

on june 18 2019 there were approximately 25797 shareholders of record of the company’s ordinary shares ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 500 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2019 and 460 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2018  

stock performance graph 

the following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on medtronic’s ordinary shares with the cumulative total shareholder return on the standard  poor’s sp 500 index and the sp 500 health care equipment index for the last five fiscal years the graph assumes that 100 was invested at market close on april 25 2014 in medtronic’s ordinary shares the sp 500 index and the sp 500 health care equipment index and that all dividends were reinvested

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the eu if they had been made between member states of the eu this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt eritrea iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan syria tunisia ukraine and zimbabwe 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax currently 20 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

 

 irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 26 2019 and april 27 2018 and for each of the three fiscal years ended april 26 2019 fiscal year 2019 april 27 2018 fiscal year 2018 and april 28 2017 fiscal year 2017  which are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures and are intended to supplement and should not be considered as superior to financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we generally use nongaap financial measures to facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning we believe that nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the companys underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry 

as presented in the gaap to nongaap reconciliations section below our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the income tax provision adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows

executive level overview 

medtronic is among the worlds largest medical technology services and solutions companies  alleviating pain restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders cardiovascular disease advanced and general surgical care respiratory and monitoring solutions renal care neurological disorders spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma urological and digestive disorders and ear nose and throat and diabetes conditions 

the table below presents net income attributable to medtronic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  



the increase in net income attributable to medtronic and diluted earnings per share eps for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to the 24 billion tax charge recognized during fiscal year 2018 related to the enactment of us comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act further contributing to the increases was a reduction in other operating expense net and an increase in other nonoperating income net these items were partially offset by the 697 million gain on the sale of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the minimally invasive therapies group on july 29 2017 the divestiture in fiscal year 2018 along with increases in interest expense and restructuring and associated costs 

the decrease in net income attributable to medtronic and diluted eps for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably affected by the aforementioned 24 billion tax charge related to the tax act along with the impacts of the divestiture 

net sales of the divested businesses for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were 06 billion and 24 billion respectively for fiscal year 2018 decreases in net income attributable to medtronic and diluted eps were partially offset by a 697 million gain on the divestiture

segment and division 

the table below illustrates net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  



net sales growth for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to strong growth in our restorative therapies group and diabetes group partially offset by the impact of the divestiture within the minimally invasive therapies group 

our performance displays our continued execution against our three growth strategies therapy innovation globalization and economic value we continue to allocate our capital to higher growth markets and new opportunities that create competitive advantages and capitalize on the longterm trends in healthcare namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes the growing demand for expanded access to care and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems 

we continue to see an acceleration in our innovation cycle within our therapy innovation growth strategy our segments invest in a pipeline of groundbreaking medical technology with several recent product launches and adoption of new therapies contributing to net sales growth we remain focused on our globalization strategy as net sales in emerging markets grew 6 percent during fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  our emerging market performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification with strong balanced results around the world finally in our third growth strategy economic value we continue to execute our valuebased healthcare signature programs and aggressively develop unique valuebased healthcare solutions that directly link our therapies to improving outcomes while delivering improved economic value to the payers and providers we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume 

segment and market geography 

the tables below include net sales by market geography for each of our segments for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017 





 net sales increases in the us for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 were primarily attributable to strong growth in our restorative therapies group and diabetes group partially offset by the impact of the divestiture within the minimally invasive therapies group net sales remained flat in nonus developed markets for fiscal year 2019  reflecting consistent growth across our segments in japan and korea partially offset by declines in australia net sales growth in emerging markets continues to reflect our broad diversification and was driven by strong performance in china the middle east  africa eastern europe and both south and southeast asia currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales in nonus developed markets and emerging markets of 205 million and 250 million respectively for fiscal year 2019  

net sales declines in the us for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 were primarily attributable to the divestiture within the minimally invasive therapies group partially offset by growth in our other segments net sales growth in nonus 

developed markets was led by strong performance in western europe net sales growth in emerging markets continues to reflect our broad diversification and was driven by strong performance in all of our segments with strong performance in china latin america eastern europe and the middle east  africa 

looking ahead our segments are likely to face competitive product launches and pricing pressure geographic macroeconomic risks reimbursement challenges impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings the timing of product registration approvals replacement cycle challenges and fluctuations in currency exchange rates additionally changes in procedural volumes could affect our cardiac and vascular minimally invasive therapies and restorative therapies groups 

cardiac and vascular group 

the cardiac and vascular group’s products include pacemakers insertable and external cardiac monitors cardiac resynchronization therapy devices crtd implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd leads and delivery systems ventricular assist systems ablation products electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems balloons and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products the cardiac and vascular group also includes care management services and cath lab managed services clms within the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 115 billion  an increase of 1 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2019 of 182 million the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018  benefited from net sales growth in coronary  structural heart and aortic peripheral  venous formerly known as aortic  peripheral vascular divisions offset by declines in cardiac rhythm  heart failure 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 58 billion  a decrease of 2 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales decrease for fiscal year 2019 was driven by declines in heart failure care management services and clms offset by growth in arrhythmia management the decline in heart failure was driven by crtd replacements and lvad headwinds due to a competitor product launch in the us and changes in the us heart transplant guidelines the growth in arrhythmia management was driven by af solutions due to the continued strength of the arctic front cardiac cryoablation catheter system and diagnostics due to growth from our reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor arrhythmia management net sales growth also benefited from strong adoption of the tyrx absorbable antibacterial envelope through further expansion of valuebased healthcare arrangements 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 37 billion  an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  coronary  structural heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2019 was driven by the global strength of the corevalve evolut pro transcatheter aortic valve system evolut pro and continued penetration into intermediate risk in the us as well as growth in cannulae including the biomedicus next gen cannulae guide catheters and coronary balloons 

aortic peripheral  venous net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 19 billion  an increase of 4 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  aortic peripheral  venous net sales growth for fiscal year 2019 was driven by strong performance of the venaseal vein closure system for which final approval for reimbursement payment in the us from the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms was received in january 2018 growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta balloons as well as the launch of the valiant navion thoracic stent graft system which received us fda and ce mark approval in october and november 2018 respectively 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 59 billion  an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was driven by strong growth in arrhythmia management and heart failure the strong growth in arrhythmia management was largely due to growth in af solutions driven by the continued global acceptance of our arctic front cardiac cryoablation catheter system growth in diagnostics driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor as well as strong adoption of the micra transcatheter pacing system and tyrx absorbable antibacterial envelope the strong growth in heart failure was driven by growth in mechanical circulatory support from sales of the hvad system as well as continued demand for the crtp quadripolar pacing system which launched in the us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 36 billion  an increase of 14 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  coronary  structural heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was largely driven by the continued strong customer adoption of evolut pro and the evolut r 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve as well as continued penetration into intermediate risk in the us which received approval late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 net sales growth was also driven by the continued strong demand for the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in the us and japan which launched in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

aortic peripheral  venous net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 18 billion  an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  aortic peripheral  venous net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was driven by growth in valiant captivia thoracic stent grafts pta and drugcoated balloons as well as success of the helifx endoanchor system net sales growth was further driven by strong performance in endovenous due to accelerated growth of the venaseal vein closure system for which approval for reimbursement payment in the us from cms was received in january 2018 

looking ahead we expect our cardiac and vascular group could be affected by the following

respiratory gastrointestinal  renal net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 32 billion  a decrease of 33 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  respiratory gastrointestinal  renal net sales declined as a result of the divestiture apart from the decline in net sales due to the divestiture net sales performance in respiratory gastrointestinal  renal benefited from growth in gi solutions the strength in nellcor pulse oximetry products due to the intensity of the flu season in the us the continued adoption of microstream capnography monitoring product and growth in airway and ventilation net sales 

looking ahead we expect our minimally invasive therapies group could be affected by the following 



been working to identify alternate suppliers and rerouting our supply chain and expect to return to full sterilization capacity late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 



restorative therapies group 

the restorative therapies groups products focus on various areas of the spine bone graft substitutes biologic products trauma implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain movement disorders epilepsy overactive bladder urinary retention fecal incontinence and gastroparesis as well as products to treat conditions of the ear nose and throat ent and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments the restorative therapies group also manufactures and sells imageguided surgery and intraoperative imaging systems robotic guidance systems used in robot assisted spine procedures and therapies to treat diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain including coils neurovascular stent retrievers and flow diversion products the restorative therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 82 billion  an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  currency had a negative impact on net sales for fiscal year 2019 of 73 million  the restorative therapies group’s performance for fiscal year 2019 was driven by the brain therapies specialty therapies and pain therapies divisions 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 27 billion  a decrease of 1 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  despite the decline we saw incremental growth driven by increased spinal impact attachment rates in conjunction with our surgical synergy strategy which integrates our spinal implants with enabling technologies such as robotics imaging navigation power instruments and nerve monitoring further contributing to growth was our speedtoscale initiative which involves faster innovation cycles and the launching of a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market recently launched products include the infinity oct system and the solera voyager 5560 fixation system 

brain therapies net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 26 billion  an increase of 11 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  brain therapies net sales growth was driven by strong growth in both neurovascular and neurosurgery neurovascular net sales growth was driven by strength across our stroke franchise with growth across our stent retriever flow diversion neuro access coil and embolic protection products neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong capital equipment sales of the mazor x robotic guidance systems stealthstation s8 surgical navigation systems midas rex powered surgical instrument systems oarm imaging systems and visualase mriguided laser ablation systems 

specialty therapies net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 16 billion  an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  net sales growth was driven by strong sales of the aquamantys biopolar sealers and plasmablade dissection devices within transformative solutions and growth in ent 

pain therapies net sales for fiscal year 2019 were 13 billion  an increase of 10 percent as compared to fiscal year 2018  the increase in net sales was driven by our intellis spinal cord stimulation platform which received us fda approval in september 2017 and ce mark in november 2017 further driving net sales growth were the evolve workflow algorithm snapshot reports and our targeted drug delivery products including the new clinician and patient programmers 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 27 billion  an increase of 1 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  spine net sales growth was driven by growth in bone morphogenetic protein composed of infuse bone graft inductos in the european union partially offset by a slight decline in core spine core spine net sales declined due to continued overall market softness in the us and europe partially offset by the continued success of our surgical synergy strategy and our speedtoscale initiative 

brain therapies net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 24 billion  an increase of 12 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  brain therapies net sales growth was driven by strong growth in both neurovascular and neurosurgery neurovascular net sales growth was driven by strength across our stroke portfolio specifically in stents as a result of our leading role in the development of the endovascular therapy market for treatment of ischemic stroke neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong sales of the stealthstation s8 surgical navigation system oarm o2 surgical imaging system visualase mriguided laser ablation system midas disposables as well as disposables revenue from placement of capital equipment net sales growth in neurovascular and neurosurgery for fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by slight declines in brain modulation due to competitive pressures in major markets 

specialty therapies net sales for fiscal year 2018 were 16 billion  an increase of 4 percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  specialty therapies net sales growth was driven by growth in ent pelvic health and transformative solutions

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

litigation contingencies we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property and commercial disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings income tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations the outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

income tax reserves and us tax reform we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which significantly revised us corporate income taxation by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate broadening the base of taxation and implementing a territorial tax system we had a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recognition of the related tax impacts the measurement period closed during fiscal year 2019 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets primarily include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participants view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value including projected future cash flows and discount rates

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 



cost of products sold we continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management manufacturing improvements and optimizing our manufacturing network 

cost of products sold was 92 billion  91 billion  and 93 billion during fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was favorably affected by decreased sales of lowermargin products as a result of the divestiture also contributing to the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales during fiscal year 2019 was the infusion set recall in our diabetes group along with 17 million of costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four puerto rico manufacturing sites after hurricane maria including idle facility costs asset writedowns and other facilityrelated costs incurred during fiscal year 2018  these benefits were slightly offset by increased restructuring and associated costs a change in product mix due to strong growth in some of our lowermargin businesses and additional expenses incurred due to the closing of a supplier sterilization facility used by our minimally invasive therapies group during fiscal year 2019  cost of products sold for fiscal year 2019 includes 91 million of restructuring and associated costs as compared to 40 million for fiscal year 2018  

the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales from fiscal year 2018 as compared to 2017 was due primarily to decreased sales of lowermargin products as a result of the divestiture and a 38 million charge recognized during fiscal year 2017 related to the fair value stepup taken on inventory acquired in connection with the heartware acquisition partially offsetting these benefits were the costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four puerto rico manufacturing sites after hurricane maria and the infusion set recall in our diabetes group during fiscal year 2018  

research and development expense we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare research and development expense was 23 billion during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and 22 billion during fiscal year 2017  

selling general and administrative expense our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions selling general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses and certain acquisition restructuring and divestiturerelated expenses 

selling general and administrative expense was 104 billion  102 billion  and 100 billion during fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the decrease in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales from fiscal year 2018 to 2019 benefited from our enterprise excellence program continued net sales growth cost containment measures and 115 million of professional service fees and accelerated stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the divestiture during fiscal year 2018  offsetting these benefits were increased restructuring and associated costs selling general and administrative expense in fiscal year 2019 includes 118 million of restructuring and associated costs as compared to 37 million in fiscal year 2018  

the increase in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was driven by expenses incurred for new product launches expenses incurred to fulfill our transition service agreements tsas that we entered into with cardinal health in conjunction with the divestiture and 115 million of professional service fees and accelerated stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the divestiture offsetting these increases were decreased acquisitionrelated items selling general and administrative expense in fiscal year 2018 includes 137 million of acquisitionrelated items as compared to 303 million in fiscal year 2017  

the following is a summary of other costs and expenses 



amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definitelived intangible assets consisting of purchased patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and other intangible assets amortization expense was 18 billion during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and 20 billion during fiscal year 2017  

while amortization expense remained consistent when comparing fiscal year 2018 to 2019  the decrease in amortization expense from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization on the definitelived intangible assets classified as assets held for sale at april 28 2017 and through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 related to the divestiture which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018  

restructuring charges net

the enterprise excellence program is expected to result in pretax restructuring charges of approximately 16 billion to 18 billion  the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023 approximately half of the estimated restructuring charges are related to employee termination benefits the remaining restructuring charges are costs associated with the restructuring program such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses we expect these costs to be recognized within restructuring charges net cost of products sold and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income

the decrease in other operating expense net from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs which combined resulted in a gain of 87 million for fiscal year 2019 and a loss of 176 million for fiscal year 2018  also contributing to the change was a charge of 80 million recognized in fiscal year 2018 for charitable contributions to the medtronic foundation and increased gains from the change in fair value of contingent consideration these items were partially offset by intangible asset impairments and other charges of 149 million associated with business exits during fiscal year 2019 and a reduction of tsa income 

the increase in other operating expense net from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs which combined resulted in a loss of 176 million for fiscal year 2018 and a gain of 81 million for fiscal year 2017  also contributing to the increase were losses of 68 million related to the impairment of iprd assets in fiscal year 2018  15 million of humanitarian aid provided to our employees affected by hurricane maria in fiscal year 2018  and a decrease in gains from the changes in fair value of contingent consideration these items were partially offset by 74 million of tsa income and a reduction in charitable contributions to the medtronic foundation

the change in other nonoperating income net from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was due to 227 million of losses recognized in fiscal year 2018 related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments partially offset by increased interest income and charges of 60 million related to the nonservice component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs associated with voluntary early retirement packages offered and accepted by certain eligible us employees during fiscal year 2017

the change in interest expense from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by modestly higher average interest rates on total debt obligations outstanding and a 38 million charge recognized in connection with the early redemption of approximately 12 billion of medtronic inc senior notes during fiscal year 2018  

income taxes 



on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly revises us corporate income taxation by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate from 350 percent to 210 percent broadening the base of taxation implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

we made the accounting policy election to treat taxes due on us inclusions in taxable income related to global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a current period expense when incurred the period cost method 

many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our blended us statutory rate thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the us statutory rate of 210 percent for fiscal year 2019  a significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in puerto rico switzerland and ireland the statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 125 percent to 451 percent our earnings in puerto rico and switzerland are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country statutory tax rates unless our tax incentive grants are extended they expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2030 the tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2019 did not have a material impact on our financial results see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 105 percent  as compared to 455 percent in fiscal year 2018  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from us tax reform certain tax adjustments the gain on the divestiture the impact from investment losses and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was 136 percent  as compared to 147 percent in fiscal year 2018  the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impacts from us tax reform and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 455 percent  as compared to 126 percent in fiscal year 2017  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from us tax reform the divestiture the utilization of nonus special deductions the net tax cost associated with an internal reorganization excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and the tax effect from the intercompany sales of certain intellectual property 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 147 percent  as compared to 162 percent in fiscal year 2017  the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction

the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017 of approximately 82 million 77 million and 76 million respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital structure is evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process we consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations which includes working capital needs investments in research and development property plant and equipment and other operating costs we also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases satisfying maturing debt and acquiring businesses and technology 

summary of cash flows 

the following is a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and the net change in cash and cash equivalents 



operating activities the 23 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily driven by our operating margin expansion as well as decreases in cash paid to suppliers and other vendors cash paid for taxes cash paid for interest and retirement benefit plan contributions partially offset by an increase in certain litigation payments the decrease in cash paid to suppliers is primarily due to our continued progress in extending supplier payment terms the decrease in cash paid for taxes was primarily a result of a 11 billion prepayment that we elected to make to the us irs in fiscal year 2018 related to inprocess litigation on puerto rico transfer pricing cash paid for interest decreased due to a decrease in total debt obligations as well as a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt obligations the decrease in retirement benefit plan contributions reflects lower contributions to the us pension plan for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  certain litigation payments increased primarily due to the payment of previously accrued settlement amounts for the infuse litigation matter 

the 22 billion decrease in net cash provided in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in cash paid for taxes of 15 billion an increase in net cash outflows for collateral related to our derivative instruments of 145 million cash paid for divestiturerelated expenses of approximately 100 million and a decrease in cash collected from customers the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of the aforementioned 11 billion puerto rico prepayment tax payments related to the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the divestiture as well as settlement payments for us federal income taxes for fiscal years 2012 to 2014 and audit settlements outside of the us 

investing activities the 66 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to the divestiture in fiscal year 2018  which resulted in net proceeds of 61 billion and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of 17 billion primarily due to the acquisition of mazor and epix during fiscal year 2019  partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments 

the 74 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to the divestiture in fiscal year 2018  a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 12 billion primarily due to the acquisition of heartware during fiscal year 2017  and a decrease in additions to property plant and equipment 

financing activities the 65 billion decrease in net cash used in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 78 billion of eurodenominated senior notes in fiscal year 2019  partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of 706 million and an increase in repayments of commercial paper in fiscal year 2019  we repaid 79 billion of longterm debt primarily through the use of the net proceeds from the eurodebt issuance in fiscal year 2018  we repaid 74 billion of longterm debt which was not funded through the issuance of longterm debt 

the 87 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to longterm debt repayments of 74 billion the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2017  and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017  partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of 14 billion 

free cash flow 

free cash flow a nongaap financial measure is calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs current debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations at april 26 2019 was 838 million as compared to 21 billion at april 27 2018  longterm debt at april 26 2019 was 245 billion as compared to 237 billion at april 27 2018  we utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our longterm financing needs from time to time we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 

total debt at april 26 2019 was 253 billion  as compared to 258 billion at april 27 2018  the decrease in total debt was primarily driven by the reduction in our commercial paper borrowings of 698 million partially offset by the net impact of the issuance cash tender offer early redemptions and repayment described below 

in march 2019 medtronic global holdings sca medtronic luxco issued six tranches of eurodenominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of €70 billion  with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2039 resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 78 billion  net of discounts and issuance costs we used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the previously announced cash tender offers and early redemption described below the eurodenominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our european operations 

we completed the cash tender offer and early redemption of 64 billion of medtronic inc and cifsa senior notes for 69 billion of total consideration in march 2019 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 485 million which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums the loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income also in march 2019 we repaid our 1700 percent twoyear 2017 senior notes including interest for 10 billion

we maintain a commercial paper program for shortterm financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion at april 26 2019  we had no commercial paper outstanding as compared to 698 million outstanding at april 27 2018  during fiscal years 2019 and 2018  the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 27 and 28 days respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 212 percent and 146 percent  respectively the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion fiveyear syndicated credit facility credit facility which was amended and restated in december 2018 and now expires in december 2023 the credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes the credit facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 10 billion at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date we could also request a oneyear extension of the maturity date at april 26 2019 and april 27 2018 no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit 

interest rates on advances of our credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp and moodys refer to the liquidity section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we were in compliance with at april 26 2019

liquidity 

our liquidity sources at april 26 2019 include 44 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 55 billion of current investments additionally we maintain a commercial paper program no commercial paper outstanding at april 26 2019 and credit facility see discussion above regarding changes in our cash and cash equivalents commercial paper program and credit facility 

our investments include availableforsale debt securities including us and nonus government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss 

for fiscal year 2019  the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recognized all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost at april 26 2019  we have 61 million of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate availableforsale debt securities of 55 billion  if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary impairment in the future which could adversely affect our financial results we are required to use estimates and assumptions in our valuation of investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual results could differ materially from estimates see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the following table is a summary of our standard and poors rating services sp and moodys investors service moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings 



 sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 26 2019 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 27 2018  we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and credit facility and related commercial paper program 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows refer to the offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations section of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on these obligations and commitments 

note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested we have removed our permanently reinvested assertion on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries with a us parent which were subject to the transition tax we removed the assertion for all earnings of such subsidiaries through april 27 2018 and reasserted for earnings generated for subsequent fiscal years we expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future in addition we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and that our cash cash equivalents and current investments as well as our credit facility and related commercial paper program will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements 

presented below is a summary of our offbalance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at april 26 2019  as well as longterm contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at april 26 2019  








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the euro japanese yen and british pound fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 26 2019 and april 27 2018 was 111 billion and 115 billion  respectively at april 26 2019  these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of 322 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 26 2019 indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies the fair value of these contracts would increasedecrease by approximately 916 million any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 we began accounting for our operations in argentina as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent the change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year 2019 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio at april 26 2019 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars and the euro of which substantially all is fixed rate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest ratesensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates as compared to interest rates at april 26 2019  indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 49 million

other factors impacting our operations 

research and development 

the chart below illustrates our research and development rd expense and rd expense as a percentage of net sales during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  

the markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products are necessary to maintain market leadership our rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use and developing new therapies and procedures we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets clinical evidence generation and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole 

we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time for additional information see note 19  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns primarily through thirdparty distributors although we also have direct sales representatives we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our four largest markets are the us western europe japan and china emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products 

we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition industry and cost containment 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in   more than 150   countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms hospitals which purchase implants are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example centralized purchasing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues earnings and cash flows from operations we use operational and economic hedges as well as derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 9  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 21  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however due to the us fda’s manufacturing requirements we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “item 2 properties” in this annual report on form 10k

worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere particularly in european countries 

government regulation 

our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european regulatory authorities such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom uk and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices in germany the china food and drug administration cfda and other government agencies inside and outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

product approval and monitoring 

many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance safety and quality of our products authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the us is generally obtained in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use this process is generally much more timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes the competent authorities of the eu countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market a new medical device regulation was published by the eu in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the regulation has a threeyear implementation 

period to may 2020 after that time medical devices marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements except that devices with valid ce certificates issued pursuant to the medical device directives before may 2020 can be placed on the market until may 2024 

the global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact the cost the time needed to approve and ultimately our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products regulations of the us fda and other regulatory agencies in and outside the us impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business these agencies review our design and manufacturing practices labeling record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other regulatory bodies both in and outside the us including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the promotion and advertising of our products any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation s 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our pain therapies divisions synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system were lifted by the us fda in september 2017 following the successful completion of the required thirdparty expert audits and in coordination with the fda the consent decree will be vacated the company must undergo thirdparty audits and submit audit reports to the us fda through 2020 

in june 2016 tyrx received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey the us fda completed its follow up inspection to the warning letter in march 2018 and issued a 483 with observations although the us fda noted in its closing meeting that there had been significant improvements made since the prior inspection we continue to make progress on our commitments and continuously report the progress to the us fda in june 2014 heartware inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the heartware facility in miami lakes florida we acquired heartware in august 2016 and have been implementing actions and process improvements to address the items in the warning letter upon completing implementation of actions and process improvements to address the items in the warning letters and reinspection by the us fda we expect that the tyrx and heartware warning letters will be lifted 

trade regulations 

the movement of products services and investment across borders subject us to extensive trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders these laws and regulations govern among other things our import export and other business activities we are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if we or the third parties through which we do business are not in compliance with applicable import export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services violate antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs new compliance challenges and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

for example in the us the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers privacy and security rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims health plans and health care clearinghouses and by their “business associates” which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce rules under hipaa and hitech include specific security standards and breach notification requirements the us department of health and human services hhs through the office of civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to both the security and privacy rules including civil and criminal liability with the exception of certain of its operations in its diabetes and care management services businesses medtronic is generally not a covered entity medtronic also operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances there are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers and medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses 

in addition to the regulation of personal health information a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data state consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers 

outside the us we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international national and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customers in more than 150 countries legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalties in the eu increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in may 2018 the new eu general data protection regulation gdpr applies uniformly across the eu and includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for noncompliance the gdpr also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the eu to comply with eu privacy and data protection rules 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services 

us federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded health care programs including laws related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and health care fraud there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other health care programs and private thirdparty payers in some circumstances insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved 

devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them further as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” the us is implementing valuebased payment methodologies and seeking to create alternate payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered together with all the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the sec furthermore additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business our business financial condition operating results cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties 

risks relating to the company 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies from time to time we have lost and may in the future lose market share in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products which highlights the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems to our business in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price further our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop acquire and market new and differentiated products technologies and intellectual property and as a result we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success 

reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture the majority of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities worldwide we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain components and raw materials used in our products are obtained from a sole supplier although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these components and raw materials may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies including the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources furthermore the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and could result in lost sales 

other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes or wildfires and other environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation for example in june 2017 we experienced a global information technology systems 

interruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing processes furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured at a particular manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities such as the damage caused by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september 2017 we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices and technologies as well as our business activities are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance it may 

 both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda and other applicable nonus government agency regulations for instance many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with applicable regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda and other nonus government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations furthermore we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we cannot predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigations any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs andor entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligations these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

governmental regulations outside the us have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and common in the european union for example a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which when it enters into full force in 2020 will 

include significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for regulatory noncompliance could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services including laws and regulations related to kickbacks false claims selfreferrals and health care fraud many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers in certain circumstances insurance companies can attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties 

we are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and these licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts reputational harm adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing defects design flaws offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

any of the foregoing problems including future product liability claims or recalls regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives which requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

health care policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government state governments regulators and thirdparty payers to control these costs and more generally to reform the health care system including us health care reform legislation certain of these proposals could among other things limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a thirdparty insurer that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses there may be a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers on our customers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results 

we develop manufacture distribute and sell our products globally operations in countries outside of the us are accompanied by certain risks we intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the us especially in emerging markets which could expose us to additional and greater risks our profitability and global operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

 on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu although it is unknown what those terms will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities similarly from time to time proposals are made in the us to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the us and other countries although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented changes to trade policy may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with antibribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentadministered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws we also participate in publicprivate partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more frequent voluntary selfdisclosures by companies aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by us and nonus governmental agencies and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors it is our policy 

to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices however existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many health care industry companies including health care systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions if we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

health care industry costcontainment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components 

most of our customers and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that health care providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals and gpos and idns have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies including us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we violate these environmental laws and regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers if we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on the proper function security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business and a breach cyberattack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position    

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business including to process transmit and store sensitive data and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to our systems like other large multinational corporations we could experience and in the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems as well as data breaches such as cyberattacks malicious intrusions breakdowns interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions furthermore we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems these thirdparty systems could also become vulnerable to cyberattack malicious intrusions breakdowns interference or other significant disruptions and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and as a result may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems 

our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “item 1 business  other factors impacting our operations  data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations  for example in the eu the data protection directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the eu and the new general data protection regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations occurring after its implementation in may 2018 furthermore there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyberattacks any data security breaches cyberattacks malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies andor civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation or competitive position 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 

if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality and we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

at april 27 2018 we had approximately 21 billion  of current debt obligations and 237 billion  of longterm debt outstanding we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

 we also could experience negative effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the us ireland and various other jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act  which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our quarter ending january 2018 associated with the us taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue us deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the us corporate tax rate 

certain elements of the tax act impact fiscal year 2018 while other portions of the legislation are not effective until future fiscal years the us treasury has issued additional guidance subsequent to the enactment of the tax act  and we expect ongoing guidance to be provided which could change the impact on our tax reserves we made reasonable estimates of the effect of the tax act and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2018 additional guidance as well as future changes to these rules may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect our financial results 

in 2013 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published an action plan called base erosion and profit shifting beps with a view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authorities and their approach to international tax matters the final beps action report was published in october 2015 and subsequently many taxing authorities have adopted the guidelines provided within their local laws the eu expanded upon these guidelines with antitax avoidance directives atad to be applied by its member states we continue to monitor any and all changes to local country legislation resulting from this guidance one specific change is a requirement for increased disclosures of financial information on a local and global basis this information could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing sites an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 19  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because medtronic plc is organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the covidien transaction held 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership 

test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly our articles of association contain as permitted by irish company law provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares and to disapply statutory preemption rights the authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market 

value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold which irish revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the eu if they had been made between member states of the eu this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt eritrea iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan syria tunisia and ukraine 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax currently 20 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

 

 irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 27 2018  and april 28 2017  and for each of the three fiscal years ended april 27 2018  fiscal year 2018 april 28 2017  fiscal year 2017 and april 29 2016  fiscal year 2016  which are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k our fiscal yearend is the last friday in april and therefore the total weeks in a fiscal year fluctuates between 52 and 53 weeks fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were 52week years fiscal year 2016 was a 53week year with the additional week occurring in the first quarter 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures and are intended to supplement and should not be considered as superior to financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we generally use nongaap financial measures to facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning we believe that nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the companys underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry 

as presented in the gaap to nongaap reconciliations section below our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the income tax provision adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows

diluted earnings per share eps for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  was unfavorably affected by the net 24 billion tax charge related to the enactment of us comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which had a significant effect on the income tax provision in fiscal year 2018  further diluted eps for fiscal year 2018  was unfavorably affected by an investment loss related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments of 227 million  along with impairments of iprd of 68 million  additionally for fiscal year 2018  diluted eps was unfavorably affected by the july 29 2017 sale of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the minimally invasive therapies group net sales of these businesses for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  were 06 billion and 24 

billion respectively for fiscal year 2018  diluted eps was partially offset by a 697 million  gain on the sale of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses 

diluted eps for fiscal year 2017 as compared to 2016 was favorably affected by the recognition of certain tax adjustments of 417 million including a charge of 442 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily related to the us income tax expense resulting from our completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by our us controlled nonus subsidiaries partially offset by a benefit related to the establishment of a deferred tax asset on the tax basis in excess of book basis of a wholly owned us subsidiary of which we disposed further diluted eps was also affected by a 226 million charge in fiscal year 2016 related to the recognition of the fair value stepup of acquired covidien inventory

net sales 

segment and division 

the table below illustrates net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  



 for fiscal year 2018  total net sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the minimally invasive therapies group which closed on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies therapy innovation globalization and economic value we are creating competitive advantages and capitalizing on the longterm trends in healthcare namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes the growing demand for expanded access to care and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems in our therapy innovation growth strategy we continue to see clear acceleration in our innovation cycle with several meaningful new product launches during fiscal year 2018 across all of our segments we advanced a pipeline of groundbreaking medical technology and we are creating new markets disrupting existing markets and leading in several of the fastest growth markets in globalization net sales in emerging markets grew 12  during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 our consistent emerging market performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification with strong balanced results around the world in our third growth strategy economic value we continue to execute our valuebased healthcare signature programs and aggressively develop unique valuebased healthcare solutions that directly link our therapies to improving outcomes across each of our segments we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume 

segment and market geography 

the tables below include net sales by market geography for each of our segments for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016 





 for fiscal year 2018  net sales for the us decreased 5  percent developed markets outside the us increased 6  percent and emerging markets increased 12  percent as compared to fiscal year 2017  net sales declines in the us were impacted by the july 29 2017 divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the minimally invasive therapies group partially offset by growth in the other segments net sales growth in nonus developed markets was led by strong performance in western europe emerging market sales growth was driven by solid performance in all of our segments with strong performance in china latin america eastern europe and the middle east  africa currency had a favorable effect of 494 million on net sales for fiscal year 2018  

for fiscal year 2017  net sales for the us increased 1 percent nonus developed markets increased 4 percent and emerging markets increased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2016 net sales growth across all markets was driven by meaningful product 

launches and introduction of groundbreaking new technologies partially offset by an unfavorable impact of an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 net sales growth in the us was led by strong growth in the cardiac and vascular group and minimally invasive therapies group and solid growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes group in emerging markets net sales growth was also attributable to the expansion of access to our therapies 

looking ahead our segments are likely to face competitive product launches and pricing pressure geographic macroeconomic risks reimbursement challenges impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings the timing of product registration approvals replacement cycle challenges and fluctuations in currency exchange rates additionally changes in procedural volumes could affect our cardiac and vascular minimally invasive therapies and restorative therapies groups

the cardiac and vascular group’s products include pacemakers insertable and external cardiac monitors cardiac resynchronization therapy devices crtd implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd leads and delivery systems ventricular assist systems ablation products electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents balloons and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products the cardiac and vascular group also includes care management services and cath lab managed services clms within the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2018  were 114 billion  an increase of 8  percent as compared to fiscal year 2017 currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2018  of 215 million cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017 benefited from strong net sales in all three divisions see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2018  were 59 billion  an increase of 5  percent as compared to fiscal year 2017 cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2018  was driven by strong growth in arrhythmia management and heart failure the strong growth in arrhythmia management was largely due to growth in af solutions driven by the continued global acceptance of our arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system growth in diagnostics driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor as well as strong adoption of the micra transcatheter pacing system and tyrx absorbable antibacterial envelope the strong growth in heart failure was driven by growth in mechanical circulatory support from sales of the hvad system as well as continued demand for the crtp quadripolar pacing system which launched in the us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2018  were 36 billion  an increase of 14  percent as compared to fiscal year 2017 coronary  structural heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2018  was largely driven by the continued strong customer adoption of the evolut pro transcatheter aortic valve system evolut pro and the evolut r 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve as well as continued penetration into intermediate risk in the us which received approval late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 net sales growth was also driven by the continued strong demand for the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in the us and japan which launched in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2018  were 18 billion  an increase of 6  percent as compared to fiscal year 2017 aortic  peripheral vascular net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was driven by growth in valiant captivia thoracic stent grafts percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta balloons and drugcoated balloons as well as success of the helifx endoanchor system net sales growth was further driven by strong performance in endovenous due to accelerated growth of the venaseal vein closure system for which approval for reimbursement payment in the us from the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms was initiated in january 2018 

the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 105 billion  an increase of 3  percent as compared to fiscal year 2016 the cardiac and vascular group’s net sales for fiscal year 2017 were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter fiscal year 2016 the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 benefited from strong net sales in arrhythmia management within cardiac rhythm  heart failure largely due to growth in af solutions and diagnostics coronary  structural heart largely due to the transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us and europe and in aortic  peripheral vascular as well as the acquisition of heartware in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2017 were 56 billion  an increase of 3 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016 cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was driven by strong growth in arrhythmia management largely due to growth in af solutions and diagnostics the strong growth in af solutions was driven by the continued global acceptance of our arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system including strong growth in japan the strong growth in diagnostics was driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac 

monitor cardiac rhythm  heart failure also benefited from the acquisition of heartware which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2017 were 31 billion  an increase of 1 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016 coronary  structural heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was largely driven by the continued launch of the evolut r 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us and europe net sales growth was partially offset by challenges with drugeluting stents in both the us and japan due to competitive pressures related to the anticipated approval of the resolute onyx drugeluting stents in these countries which received us fda approval as well as approval in japan during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 net sales growth was also partially offset by continued pricing pressures and competition worldwide in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2017 were 17 billion  an increase of 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016 aortic  peripheral vascular net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was driven by the continued strong worldwide growth of the inpact admiral drugcoated balloon as well as success of the helifx endoanchor system and the endurant iis aortic stent graft net sales growth as compared to fiscal year 2016 was also driven by the launch of the hawkone 6 french directional atherectomy system in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

litigation contingencies    we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property and commercial disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings income tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations the outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged 

periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

income tax reserves and us tax reform    we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly revises us corporate income taxation by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate broadening the base of taxation and implementing a territorial tax system we have a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recognition of the related tax impacts the final impact of the tax act may differ from the provisional amounts recognized in the current period possibly materially due to among other things changes in our interpretation of the tax act legislative or administrative actions to clarify the intent of the statutory language provided that differ from our current interpretation any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the impacts including changes to current year earnings estimates and applicable foreign exchange rates 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets primarily include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value including projected future cash flows we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participants view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangibles annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangibles require us to make several estimates to determine fair value including projected future cash flows and discount rates

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of cost of products sold research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 



cost of products sold  we continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management manufacturing improvements and optimizing our manufacturing network 

cost of products sold was 91 billion  93 billion  and 91 billion  during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales from fiscal year 2018 as compared to 2017 was due primarily to the divestiture of lowermargin products in conjunction with the divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses during fiscal year 2018 and a 38 million charge during fiscal year 2017  related to the recognition of the fair value stepup taken on inventory acquired in connection with the heartware acquisition the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales due to the divestiture and fairvalue stepup on heartware inventory was partially offset by 17 million of costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four puerto rico manufacturing sites after hurricane maria including idle facility costs asset writedowns and other facilityrelated costs and the infusion set recall in our diabetes group the decrease in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was largely due to a 226 million charge in fiscal year 2016 related to the recognition of the fair value stepup of acquired covidien inventory 

research and development expense we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare 

research and development expense was 23 billion  22 billion  and 22 billion  during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively research and development expense remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales with a slight decrease from fiscal year 2016  to 2018  due in part to the timing of clinical trials and product approvals as well as our sales increasing at a slower rate than the increase in research and development following the divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses 

selling general and administrative expense  our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions selling general and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries and wages as well as other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses 

selling general and administrative expense was 100 billion  97 billion  and 95 billion  during fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively selling general and administrative expense increased a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2017  to 2018  as we incurred expenses associated with new product launches and transition service agreements tsas in conjunction with the divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses on july 29 2017 we entered into tsas with cardinal to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations expenses associated with the tsa agreements are recognized in selling general and administrative expenses however tsa revenue is recognized in other expense net  thereby contributing to an increase in selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue 

selling general and administrative expense remained fairly flat as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 with a slight decrease due to cost savings associated with selling general and administrative expense initiatives 

the following is a summary of other costs and expenses 



amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets   includes the amortization expense of our definitelived intangible assets consisting of purchased patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and other intangible assets amortization expense was 18 billion  20 billion  and 19 billion  in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in amortization expense from fiscal year 2017  to fiscal year 2018  is primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization on the definitelived intangible assets classified as assets held for sale at april 28 2017 and through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 related to the divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses this divestiture was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 

restructuring 

enterprise excellence 

in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 we announced a multiyear global enterprise excellence program designed to drive longterm business growth and sustainable efficiency the enterprise excellence program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience

in fiscal year 2017  other expense net was  222 million  as compared to  107 million  in fiscal year 2016  the increase from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs which resulted in an 81 million gain for fiscal year 2017 as compared to a 314 million gain in fiscal year 2018 partially offset by the decrease in us medical device tax due to the suspension of the us medical device tax beginning january 1 2016

in fiscal year fiscal year 2017  interest expense net was 728 million  as compared to  955 million  in fiscal year 2016 the decrease in interest expense net for fiscal year 2017  was the result of a 183 million  charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities in fiscal year 2016 and a 45 million  loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year 2016 

income taxes 



on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which significantly revises us corporate income taxation by among other things lowering the us corporate income tax rate from 350 percent to 210 percent broadening the base of taxation implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the decrease in the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 percent to 210 percent results in a blended statutory tax rate of 305 percent for our fiscal year ended april 27 2018  

many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our blended us statutory rate thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the us statutory rate of 305 percent for fiscal year 2018  a significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in puerto rico switzerland and ireland the statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 125 percent to 451 percent our earnings in puerto rico and switzerland are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country statutory tax rates unless our tax incentive grants are extended they expire between fiscal years 2019 and 2029 the tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2018  did not have a material impact on our financial results see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018  was 455 percent  as compared to 126 percent  in fiscal year 2017  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from us tax reform the divestiture of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses the utilization of nonus special deductions the net tax cost associated with an internal reorganization excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and the tax effect from the intercompany sales of certain intellectual property 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2018  was 147 percent  as compared to 162 percent  in fiscal year 2017  the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2018  we recognized   135 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 61 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and a 74 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017  was 126 percent  as compared to 184 percent  in fiscal year 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was due to the net tax impact of inventory stepup debt tender premium certain litigation payments certain tax adjustments operational tax benefits described below and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2017  was 162 percent  as compared to 158 percent  in fiscal year 2016  the increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2017  we recognized 95 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 44 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a 51 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  of approximately   77 million 76 million and 74 million respectively 

certain tax adjustments 

during fiscal year 2018  certain tax adjustments of 19 billion recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income included the following 

 during fiscal year 2017  certain tax adjustments of 202 million recognized in income tax provision  in the consolidated statement of income included the following 



 during fiscal year 2016  certain tax adjustments of 417 million recognized in income tax provision  in the consolidated statement of income included the following 

 certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider these nongaap adjustments refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion of these adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital structure is evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process we consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations which includes working capital needs investments in research and development property plant and equipment and other operating costs we also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases satisfying maturing debt and acquiring businesses and technology 

summary of cash flows 

the following is a summary of cash provided by used in operating investing and financing activities the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and the net change in cash and cash equivalents 



operating activities    the 22 billion decrease in net cash provided in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily driven by an increase in cash paid for taxes of 15 billion an increase in net cash outflows for collateral related to our derivative instruments of 145 million cash paid for divestiturerelated expenses of approximately 100 million an increase in certain litigation payments of 60 million and a decrease in cash collected from customers the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of a 11 billion prepayment we elected to make to the us irs related to inprocess litigation on puerto rico transfer pricing tax payments related to the intercompany sale of intellectual property and sale of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses as well as settlement payments for us federal income taxes for fiscal years 2012 to 2014 and audit settlements outside of the us 

the 17 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily attributable to an increase in cash collected from customers as well as a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest of 350 million and 

132 million respectively and a 191 million payment in fiscal year 2016 related to the covidien tax sharing agreement the increase in cash collected from customers was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue the decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of payments made for the resolution of the kyphon acquisitionrelated matters as well as covidien income tax extension payments in fiscal year 2016 we did not make any significant tax audit settlement payments or significant extension payments in fiscal year 2017 the decrease in cash paid for interest was the result of less debt on average in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 

investing activities   the 74 billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to the sale of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses on july 29 2017 resulting in net proceeds of 61 billion a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of 12 billion primarily due to the acquisition of heartware during fiscal year 2017 and a decrease in additions to property plant and equipment 

the 38 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments in fiscal year 2017 

financing activities     the 87 billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily attributable to the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan including accrued interest for 30 billion in august 2017 the repayment of our 6000 percent tenyear 2008 cifsa senior notes including accrued interest for 12 billion in october 2017 the repayment of our 3500 percent sevenyear 2010 htwr senior notes including accrued interest for 43 million in december 2017 the repayment of our 1500 percent threeyear 2015 senior notes including accrued interest for 10 billion in march 2018 repayment of our 1375 percent fiveyear 2013 senior notes including accrued interest for 10 billion in april 2018 repayment of our 4450 percent tenyear 2010 senior notes including accrued interest and early redemption premium for 795 million in april 2018 and repayment of our 5600 percent tenyear 2009 senior notes including accrued interest and early redemption premium for 413 million in april 2018 the increase in net cash used was also due to the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2017 and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of 14 billion 

the 63 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2017 an increase in commercial paper borrowings and lower payments on maturing and extinguished debt partially offset by increases in dividends to shareholders and repurchases of ordinary shares 

free cash flow 

free cash flow a nongaap financial measure is calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs current debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations at april 27 2018  was 21 billion  as compared to 75 billion  at april 28 2017  historically we have issued senior notes to meet our longterm financing needs longterm debt at april 27 2018  was 237 billion  as compared to 259 billion  at april 28 2017  

total debt at april 27 2018  was 258 billion  as compared to 334 billion  at april 28 2017  the decrease in total debt was primarily driven by the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan and senior notes detailed below along with a reduction in our commercial paper borrowings of 203 million  

during fiscal year 2018 we repaid our senior unsecured term loan including accrued interest for 30 billion our 6000 percent tenyear 2008 cifsa senior notes including accrued interest for 12 billion our 3500 percent sevenyear 2010 htwr senior notes including interest for 43 million our 1500 percent threeyear 2015 senior notes including accrued interest for 10 billion our 1375 percent fiveyear 2013 senior notes including accrued interest for 10 billion our 4450 percent tenyear 2010 senior notes including accrued interest and early redemption premium for 795 million and our 5600 percent tenyear 2009 senior notes including accrued interest and early redemption premium for 413 million 

we maintain a commercial paper program for shortterm financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion at april 27 2018  we had 698 million  of commercial paper outstanding as compared to 901 million  at april 28 2017  during fiscal years 2018  and 2017  the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 28  and 39  days respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 146 percent  and 089 percent  respectively the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion syndicated line of credit facility credit facility which expires in january 2020 the credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes the credit facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 500 million at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date we could also request a oneyear extension of the maturity date at april 27 2018  and april 28 2017  no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit 

interest rates on advances of our credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp and moodys refer to the liquidity section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we were in compliance with at april 27 2018  

we repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders in june 2015 our board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the repurchase of 80 million of our ordinary shares at april 28 2017  we had used 51 million of the 80 million shares authorized under the june 2015 share repurchase program in june 2017 our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to 50 billion for new share repurchases replacing the previous 2015 repurchase authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares during fiscal years 2018  and 2017  we repurchased a total of 25 million  and 43 million  shares respectively under these programs at an average price of 8371  and 8303  respectively at april 27 2018  we had approximately 40 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors

liquidity 

the following table is a summary of our cash cash equivalents and current investments working capital and current ratio 

 our liquidity sources at april 27 2018  include 37 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 76 billion of current investments additionally we maintain a commercial paper program 698 million of commercial paper outstanding at april 27 2018 and credit facility see discussion above regarding changes in our cash and cash equivalents and commercial paper program and credit facility 

our current investments include marketable debt and equity securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt and equity securities include us and nonus government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities debt funds equity securities and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss 

for fiscal year 2018  the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities and funds were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recognized all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost at april 27 2018  we have 321 million  of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate availableforsale debt securities and funds of 76 billion  if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary impairment in the future which could adversely affect our financial results we are required to use estimates and assumptions in our valuation of investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual results could differ materially from estimates see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our working capital and current ratio at april 27 2018  increased as compared to april 28 2017  primarily due to the receipt of 61 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses on july 29 2017 partially offset by repayments of current and longterm debt obligations and a 11 billion income tax prepayment we elected to make to the us irs related to inprocess litigation on puerto rico transfer pricing in fiscal year 2018 

the following table is a summary of our standard and poors rating services sp and moodys investors service moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings 



 

sp and moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 27 2018  were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 28 2017  we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and credit facility and related commercial paper program 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows refer to the offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations section of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on these obligations and commitments 

note 19  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested as a result of the tax act we have removed our permanently reinvested assertion on the historical earnings through april 27 2018  for legal entities with accumulated earnings subject to the transition tax we continue to evaluate our permanently reinvested assertion for certain legal entities we expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future in addition we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility and that our cash cash equivalents and current investments as well as our 35 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program  698 million  of commercial paper outstanding at april 27 2018  will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements 

presented below is a summary of our offbalance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at april 27 2018  as well as longterm contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at april 27 2018  








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the euro japanese yen and british pound fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 27 2018  and april 28 2017  was 115 billion  and 108 billion  respectively at april 27 2018  these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of 159 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 27 2018  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies the fair value of these contracts would increasedecrease by approximately 879 million any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our shortterm investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio at april 27 2018  was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars of which approximately 95 is fixed rate debt and approximately 5 is floatingrate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest ratesensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates as compared to interest rates at april 27 2018  indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 81 million

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns primarily through thirdparty distributors although we also have direct sales representatives we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our three largest markets are the us western europe and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide  including physicians hospitals other medical institutions and gpos to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products we believe that we maintain excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry that enable us to gain a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments trends and emerging opportunities and respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and patients we attempt to enhance our presence in the medical community through active participation in medical meetings and by conducting comprehensive training and educational activities we believe that these activities contribute to physician expertise 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among hospitals and other customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power this enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendors our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition and industry 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160  countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in addition in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology 

incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues earnings and cash flows from operations we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k in addition the repatriation of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the us may result in substantial us tax cost 

for financial reporting purposes net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability due to the us fda’s requirements regarding manufacturing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our operations we have reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries pursuant to these requirements we are required to report on form sd the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2016 calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to item 2 properties in this annual report on form 10k 

working capital practices 

our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers 

employees 

on april 28 2017  we employed more than 91000  fulltime employees our employees are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere particularly in european countries in addition pulse oximetry sales may be impacted by flu season 

government regulation and other considerations 

our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda and similar agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products our business is also affected by patient privacy laws cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations the primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below 

product approval processes 

authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device or technology in the us is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device or technology in this process we must submit data that supports our equivalence claim if human clinical data is required it must be gathered in compliance with us fda investigational device exemption regulations we must receive an order from the us fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we are able to commercially distribute the new medical device or technology modifications to cleared medical devices or technologies may be made without using the 510k process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness minimally invasive therapies group products are generally subject to the premarket notification process a very small number of our devices are exempt from premarket review 

the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval pma requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective we do this by collecting data regarding design materials bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device the us fda will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective this determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device this process is much more detailed timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process a third seldom used process for approval exists for humanitarian use devices intended for patient populations of less than 4000 patients per year in the us this exemption is similar to the pma process however a full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trials is not required the threshold for approving these products is probable benefit and safety 

many countries outside the us to which we sell medical devices also subject such medical devices and technologies to their own regulatory requirements frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a country outside of the us prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however some countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device or technology and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing it is possible that laws and regulations may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute products 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes a notified body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance the competent authorities of the eu countries generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner various penalties exist for noncompliance with the laws transcribing the medical device directives a new medical device regulation has been published by the eu in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements the regulation has a threeyear implementation period and after that time all products marketed in the eu will require certification according to these new requirements 

to be sold in japan most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval or “shonin” the japanese government through the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical devices under the pharmaceutical affairs law pal oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda a quasigovernment organization performing many of the review functions for mhlw penalties for a company’s noncompliance with pal could be severe including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions mhlw and pmda also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the pal medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies 

our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future there may be no assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or costeffective manner or approved at all 

ongoing us fda regulations 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations the us fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the us fda for compliance with the us fda’s quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other us regulatory bodies including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the us department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products although surgeons are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the us fda the us fda has prohibited manufacturers from promoting products for such “offlabel” uses and has taken the position that manufacturers may only market their products for cleared or approved uses 

if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices the us fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the u s department of justice conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by thirdparty payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our pain therapies divisions synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree limits our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system unless specific conditions are met the agreement does not require the retrieval of any of our products but we must retain a thirdparty expert to inspect the neuromodulation quality system and to provide a certification that the system complies with the requirements of the consent decree once this certification is accepted by the us fda and a us fda inspection is successfully completed the limitations on manufacturer and distribution of synchromed pumps will be lifted thereafter we must submit periodic audit reports to the us fda to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree 

in june 2016 tyrx inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey we are taking action to address the warning letter and upon successful reinspection by the us fda the warning letter will be lifted 

in june 2014 heartware inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the heartware facility in miami lakes florida medtronic acquired heartware in august 2016 and is implementing actions and process improvements to address the items in the warning letter upon successful reinspection by fda the warning letter will be lifted 

governmental trade regulations 

the sale and shipment of our products and services across borders as well as the purchase of components and products from different countries subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across borders because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities these laws and regulations govern among other things our import and export activities 

the us fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance medtronic is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by several us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department we import raw materials components and finished products into the countries in which we transact business we act as the importer of record in many instances but we also sell and ship goods to third parties who are themselves responsible for complying with applicable trade laws and regulations in our role as importer of record we are directly responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations concerning the importation of our raw materials components and finished products if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or such third parties were not in compliance with applicable us fda or customs laws and regulations when engaging in crossborder transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability depending on the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability in addition such determinations may cause supply chain disruptions and delays in the distribution of our products that impact our business activities 

many countries control the export and reexport of goods technology and services for reasons including public health national security regional stability antiterrorism policies and other reasons in certain circumstances approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods technology or services are exported or reexported to certain destinations to certain endusers and for certain enduses in addition sales of our medical devices to customers outside of the us for medical devices that have not received us fda approval are subject to us fda export requirements some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or the third parties through which we export goods were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability similarly such determinations may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products or result in restrictions being placed upon our distribution and sales of products which may materially impact our business activities 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their controlledinfact subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and countries outside of the us currently the us considers the arab league boycott of israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott we are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirements of us antiboycott laws for all transactions in which we are involved if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services are determined to have violated us antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability penalties for any violations of antiboycott laws and regulations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines imprisonment debarment from government contracts loss of export privileges and the denial of certain tax benefits including foreign tax credits and outside us subsidiary deferrals 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

as a business with a significant global footprint compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology systems products such as medical devices and other services provided by us may result in increased costs lower revenue new complexities in compliance new challenges for competition and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce 

for example in the us the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers privacy and security rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa as amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims health plans and health care clearinghouses and by their “business associates” which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce rules under hipaa and hitech include specific security standards and breach notification requirements us department of health and human services hhs through the office of civil rights has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to both the security and privacy rules including civil and criminal liability medtronic is generally not a covered entity with a few exceptions such as our diabetes business medtronic monitoring inc beacon idtf and our health insurance plans medtronic also operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances in those cases the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information there are comparable state level laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers and medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses 

the us fda has issued guidance advising manufacturers to take cybersecurity risks into account in product design for connected medical devices and systems to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical devices that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threats into hospital systems that are connected to such devices the us fda also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical devices 

in addition to the regulation of personal health information a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such as social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with 48 us states now enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers 

outside the us we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international national and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customers in approximately 160 countries legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes more privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalties in the eu increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry are scheduled to go into effect in may 2018 

these laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data protected health information and our information technology systems they also impact our ability to move store and access data across geographic boundaries compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices complicate our operations and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs they also may complicate our clinical research activities as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data 

because the laws and regulations continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at times inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant cost expenditures or changes in products or business that reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines penalties or orders to stop noncompliant activities 

cost containment initiatives 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs hospitals which purchase implants are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that may participate 

in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

some thirdparty payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private thirdparty payers in addition some private thirdparty payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms in markets significant to medtronics business outside of the us include japan where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures as a result of our manufacturing efficiencies cost controls and other costsavings initiatives we believe we are wellpositioned to respond to changes resulting from the worldwide trend toward costcontainment however uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation new or changed coverage and reimbursement from government or private payers or decisions or other reforms making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of costcontainment trends on future operating results 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services 

us federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded health care programs the principal us federal laws include 1 the antikickback statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing ordering recommending making referrals to items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program 2 the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federallyfunded health care program including claims resulting from a violation of the antikickback statute 3 the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider and 4 health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payer there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other health care programs and private thirdparty payers insurance companies may also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico in addition as a manufacturer the us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals further the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa may be used to prosecute companies in the us for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the us if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in legislative regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us similar to other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials to the best of our knowledge at this time we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position andor cash flows 

litigation risks 

patent litigation    we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others” and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

product liability and other claims    we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class we are also susceptible to other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation these claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes products and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm to our reputation or adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows” and note 20  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

insurance 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks and we made this decision based on costs and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy providing coverage for our directors and officers we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future based on historical loss trends we believe that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends however may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in us involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our businesses and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to the company 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160  countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our products or proposed products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

competitive factors include 

 we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry 

reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture most of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities located throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability however we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and to make our related product sales 

other problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at 

the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost 

moreover pursuant to the conflict minerals requirements promulgated by the sec as a part of doddfrank we are required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials we will continue to incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to evaluate the source of any conflict minerals in our products and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of our raw materials 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater regulation in the future 

our medical devices and technologies and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations and an aggressive enforcement environment including by the us fda us department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities these authorities and members of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we will continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our business we anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda and comparable agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions and cash flows even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance it may 

 both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with the us fda’s requirements including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement since 2009 the us fda has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations including medical device companies by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the u s department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling a number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “offlabel” uses including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for “offlabel” uses constitute false and fraudulent claims to the government the failure to 

comply with “offlabel” promotion restrictions can result in significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

pursuant to doddfrank the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries under the rules we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2016 calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free in addition we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

governmental regulations outside the us have become increasingly stringent and more common and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future in the european union for example a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 which when it enters into full force will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for a company’s noncompliance with governmental regulation could be severe including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions any governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the health and safety of our employees the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical products and endoflife disposal and takeback programs for medical devices our operations involve the use of substances regulated under such laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we violate these environmental laws and regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

we may in the future be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities including the past activities of companies we have acquired the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flow 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services the principal us federal laws implicated include those that prohibit i the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment known as the false claims laws ii unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federallyfunded health care programs known as the antikickback laws and iii health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who 

was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider known as the stark law many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action claiming treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals 

our profitability and international operations are subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the us and outside of the us or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by cms any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation against us can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation we believe the results associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which would generally have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications owned by us may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes products and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm to our reputation or adverse verdicts or costly settlements and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing defects design flaws offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

further we have elected to selfinsure with respect to product liability risks and any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could be costly to defend and resolve see our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses any of the foregoing problems including product liability claims or product recalls in the future regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

health care policy changes including us health care reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government state governments regulators and thirdparty payers to control these costs and more generally to reform the us health care system certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “aca” and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 together the law or the legislation provide for a number of healthcare policy changes that are or will be applicable to us however there are many programs and requirements under the law for which the consequences are not fully understood and it is unclear what the full impacts will ultimately be from the law the legislation provides for significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 23 percent excise tax on all us medical device sales that commenced in january 2013 although the excise tax has been suspended by congress until the end of 2017 its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years under the legislation the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately 20 billion over 10 years the law also focuses on a number of medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies the medicare provisions include valuebased payment programs increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination such as bundled physician and hospital payments additionally the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending 

currently the us congress is considering legislation to repeal and replace the aca we cannot predict whether the aca will be repealed replaced or modified or how such repeal replacement or modification may be timed or structured as a result we cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal replacement or modification might have on our business and results of operations however any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a third party insurer that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will suffer 

we may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will be adversely affected 

we may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil gas and other commodities 

we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities oil gas and pulp prices are volatile and may increase resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the costcontainment efforts of our customers and thirdparty payers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

economic and political instability around the world could adversely affect our revenues financial condition or results of operations 

there can be no assurance that economic and political instability around the world will not adversely affect our revenues financial condition or results of operations our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis if at all as with our customers and vendors these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the us failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results 

although our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange we are a global company operations in countries outside of the us which account for approximately 44 percent of our net sales for fiscal year 2017 are accompanied by certain financial and other risks that would not be faced by a company operating purely within the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the us especially in emerging markets which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations our profitability and international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 



 there are recent legislative proposals to tax profits of us affiliates which are earned abroad while it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact us they may materially impact our results of operations if for example our profits earned abroad are subject to us income tax or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu although it is unknown what those terms will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities similarly from time to time proposals are made in the us to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the us and other countries although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented changes to trade policy may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the us net of expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more frequent voluntary selfdisclosures by companies aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by us and nonus governmental agencies and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors because these parties are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions due to our international operations we are subject to such laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and those in the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and surgical tools and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these 

regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

in response to a variety of actions by legislators regulators and third party payers to reduce the perceived rise in healthcare costs many health care industry companies including health care systems are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows would suffer 

our business is indirectly subject to health care industry costcontainment measures that could result in reduced sales of medical devices and medical devices containing our components 

most of our customers and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that health care providers are instituting both in the us and outside of the us could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals 

in an effort to reduce costs many existing and potential customers for our products within the us have become members of gpos and idns gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members gpos and idns typically award contracts on a categorybycategory basis through a competitive bidding process bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting processes we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major gpos and idns across our product portfolio furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products thereby reducing our profitability 

while having a contract with a gpo and idn for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that gpo or idn such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained gpos and idns increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a gpo or idn for a certain product category members of the gpo or idn generally are free to purchase from other suppliers furthermore gpo and idn contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days’ notice accordingly although we have multiple contracts with many major gpos and idns the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers if we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

cyberattacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology we rely on information technology systems to collect and process customer orders manage product manufacturing and shipping and support regulatory compliance and we routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information protected health information and business information many of our products and services incorporate software and information technology that allow patients and physicians to be connected and collect data regarding a patient and the therapy he or she is receiving or that otherwise allow the products or services to operate as intended we could experience and in the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruptions in our technology systems as well as data breaches we could also experience attempted or actual interference with the integrity of our products and data these incidents could materially harm our business and our reputation 

as is the case with other large enterprises the size and complexity of our products services and information technology systems can make them vulnerable to cyberattacks breakdown interruptions destruction loss or compromise of data obsolescence or incompatibility among systems or other significant disruptions unauthorized persons may attempt to inappropriately access our products or systems in order to disrupt disable or degrade such products or services or to obtain proprietary or confidential information such unauthorized access or interference with our products or services could create issues with product functionality which could pose a risk to patient safety and a risk of product recall or field activity 

we have programs processes and technologies in place to prevent detect contain respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents we undertake considerable ongoing improvements to our systems connected devices and informationsharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities in accordance with industry and regulatory standards because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect anticipating identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur may be challenging 

we also rely on third party vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems third party systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or unexpectedly compromise the information security of our own systems and we are dependent on these third parties to provide reliable systems and software and to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems 

in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions as a result of acquisitions we may face risks due to implementation modification or remediation of controls procedures and policies relating to data privacy and cybersecurity at the acquired company we continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and to upgrade and expand our information system capabilities for stable and secure business operations 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and prevent disruptions outages or data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations including data protection and cyber security laws and regulations in many jurisdictions the variety of us and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in item 1 business  other factors impacting our operations  data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations we have programs to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations however there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies enforcement actions may be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business in addition there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber attacks while medtronic has not been named in any such suits if a substantial breach or loss of data were to occur we could become a target of such litigation 

our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business if our information technology systems products or services or sensitive data are compromised patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality and we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach product failure information technology outages or disruptions or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation 

negative conditions in global credit markets may impair our ability to issue debt securities and impact the liquidity andor market value of investments in marketable debt securities which may cause us losses and liquidity issues 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include government and agency securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit debt funds and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities market conditions over the past several years have included periods of significant economic uncertainty and at times general market distress during these periods we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixedincome investment market including the securities in which we invest in the event we need to sell these securities we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or for a value that is equal to the underlying principal in addition we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge if we determine that the fair value of such securities is temporarily impaired we would record a temporary impairment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income within shareholders’ equity if it is determined that the fair value of these securities is otherthantemporarily impaired we would record a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

negative market conditions may also impair our ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities or may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institutions 

our products are continually the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several acquisitions in recent years including the 2015 acquisition of covidien and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 



 we also could experience negative effects on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

we may not complete the planned disposition of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the patient monitoring  recovery division of our minimally invasive therapies group on the anticipated timeline or at all and even if completed we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate 

in april 2017 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses within the patient monitoring  recovery division of our minimally invasive therapies group to cardinal health inc for 61 billion in cash subject to certain adjustments with total aftertax proceeds estimated to be approximately 55 billion we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of our 2018 fiscal year subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions in connection with the transaction we announced that we anticipate a number of benefits from the disposition including improvements in our revenue growth rate and operating margin a lower debt leverage ratio and an increased ability to fund potential investments in higher growth and higher margin opportunities 

the disposition transaction is complex in nature subject to various conditions and may be adversely affected by unanticipated developments and unexpected changes in market or other conditions if any closing conditions are not met the closing of the disposition transaction may be delayed or fail to occur and we may not achieve the intended benefits we anticipate moreover if the disposition is not completed on the anticipated timeline or at all our ongoing operation of the patient monitoring  recovery division may be harmed 

even if the disposition transaction is completed we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits including the financial and operational benefits described above and our future investments and other business opportunities that we anticipate will be facilitated by the disposition may not be successful and may prove not to be superior alternatives to the continued operation of our current patient monitoring  recovery division further execution of the proposed disposition will require significant time and attention from management and other employees including following the closing of the disposition transaction which may divert the attention of our management and other employees from the execution of our other initiatives and could affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the expansion of our services and solutions business may not yield the revenue we expect and will expose us to new risks 

we are increasingly focusing on our services and solutions businesses and the creation of comprehensive valuebased healthcare offerings in which payment is based on measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon these offerings include care management services cath lab and operating room managed services and solutions for chronic disease management we intend to expand our services and solutions model across all of our business groups and across geographic regions however we remain in the relatively early stages of developing and implementing this business model as a result we will need to invest significant expense and management resources into developing our expertise and executing our strategies and our efforts may not be profitable 

in addition the expansion of our services and solutions business model will expose us to or increase our exposure to a variety of regulations in the various countries we provide services and solutions including regulations related to government payments fraud and abuse patient privacy and the corporate practice of medicine compliance with these regulations may prove to be more costly than we anticipate and we may not successfully comply with such regulations these regulatory costs may slow our expansion into these business areas and may have a negative effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations into marketing and other business practices these investigations could result in the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to rigorous regulation by the us fda and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice and the office 

of inspector general of hhs these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices 

we cooperate with these investigations and respond to such requests however when an investigation begins we cannot predict when it will be resolved the outcome of the investigation or its impact on us an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations finally if these investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens including cost on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations or other investigations initiated by a government at any time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

at april 28 2017 our total consolidated external debt was approximately 334 billion we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various jurisdictions outside the us we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example legislation in 2010 imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers for us sales of medical devices beginning in january 2013 proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years on december 23 2010 the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues medtronic inc filed a petition with the us tax court on march 21 2011 objecting to the deficiency during october and november 2012 medtronic inc reached a resolution with the irs on various matters including the deductibility of a settlement payment medtronic inc and the irs agreed to hold one issue the calculation of amounts eligible for the onetime repatriation holiday because that issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation with the irs the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of the companys key manufacturing sites the us tax court proceeding with respect to this issue began on february 3 2015 and ended on march 12 2015 on june 9 2016 the us tax court issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 the us tax court generally rejected the irs’s position but also made certain modifications to the medtronic inc tax returns as filed during november 2016 medtronic and the irs entered into a stipulation of settled issues with the tax court which resolved the onetime repatriation holiday as an outstanding issue unless either party decided to appeal the tax court opinion and a final decision is inconsistent with the us tax court opinion the us tax court entered their final decision on january 25 2017 on april 21 2017 the irs filed their notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the 8th circuit regarding the tax court opinion a hearing date for the appeal has not been set a decision by the 8 th  circuit court of appeals overturning the tax court opinion could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

examination and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

the company has provided reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if the distribution of mallinckrodt ordinary shares to covidien shareholders in 2013 or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

covidien received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i certain transactions effected in connection with its 2013 separation of mallinckrodt qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code and ii the distribution qualifies as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling covidien received a tax opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp in form and substance acceptable to covidien which relied on the effectiveness of the irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code 

the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings in the case of the 2013 separation from covidien and mallinckrodt regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the tax opinions the irs could determine on audit that the 2013 distribution or the related internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the respective facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distributions or if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs rulings 

we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that was entered into with mallinckrodt if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 distribution are taxable 

our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations 

recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence limit the ability of foreignowned corporations to deduct interest expense tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of us corporations impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of us multinational groups and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations 

additionally the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business 

moreover tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from a crossborder business combination such as us which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act 2014 which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval which may limit medtronics flexibility to manage its capital structure 

under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders additionally subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares accordingly our articles of association contain as permitted by irish company law provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares and to disapply statutory preemption rights the authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold which irish revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents 

risks relating to the covidien acquisition the transaction 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating medtronic inc and covidien 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the medtronic inc and covidien businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of medtronic inc and covidien the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the transaction our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien all of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of the medtronic inc and covidien businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the transaction hold 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction does not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test 

in addition changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application 

since section 7874 was enacted there have been various legislative proposals to broaden its scope such proposals could among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation under section 7874 if the former shareholders of the us corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction or if the foreign corporation’s affiliated group has substantial business activities in the us and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the us accordingly if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the transactions such proposals could cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes based on our existing expected cash flows we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

specifically if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we would be subject to us corporate income tax on our worldwide income and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to us tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the us tax rules for controlled foreign corporations cfcs additionally covidiens foreign corporations which are not currently cfcs would become cfcs making them potentially subject to current or future us taxation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the us treasury department and the irs may promulgate rules that would adversely affect our tax position 

the us treasury department could make changes in the regulatory rules affecting companies that move their tax domicile outside the us in the event the us treasury department and the irs were to change the applicable regulatory rules we could face potentially substantial tax costs as a result of the transactions we cannot assess the potential impact of any such possible changes if adopted until they are announced 

on april 4 2016 the us treasury department and the irs issued proposed and temporary regulations interpreting multiple sections of the code including section 7874 to address inversion transactions and transactions that treasury and the irs characterize as “postinversion tax avoidance transactions” such regulations generally apply to transactions completed on or after september 22 2014 although in some cases they have a later effective date of april 4 2016 the regulations expand the set of circumstances under which section 7874 applies to cause the foreign acquirer of a us corporation to be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes such regulations also impose additional us taxes on certain transactions involving the acquired us corporation’s cfc’s the regulations do not cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes however if ultimately upheld by a reviewing court the regulations limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transactions involving nonus subsidiaries in addition the us treasury department and the irs issued final and temporary regulations on october 1 2016 which might limit our ability to deduct interest expense on certain intercompany debt for us federal income tax purposes 

the transaction may not allow us to maintain competitive global cash management and a competitive effective corporate tax rate 

while we believe that being incorporated in ireland should help us maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management we are unable to give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate nor global cash accessibility will be however because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate or global cash accessibility 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

except as indicated below there are no restrictions on nonresidents of ireland dealing in irish domestic securities which includes ordinary shares of irish companies except as indicated below dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to nonresident holders of such securities the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the european communities if they had been made between member states of the communities this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt eritrea iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan and syria 

any transfer of or payment in respect of a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of united nations sanctions any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into irish law 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax currently 20 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

 

 irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

understanding our financial information 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  and for each of the three fiscal years ended april 28 2017  fiscal year 2017 april 29 2016  fiscal year 2016 and april 24 2015  fiscal year 2015  our fiscal yearend is the last friday in april and therefore the total weeks in a fiscal year may fluctuate between 52 and 53 weeks fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52week years fiscal year 2016 was a 53week year with the additional week occurring in the first quarter 

early in the week of june 19 2017 we experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our ability to manufacture devices and fulfill orders from customers in a large portion of our business our systems have now been fully restored at this time we do not believe our fiscal year 2018 results of operations or financial condition will be materially affected by this incident 

on january 26 2015 the company acquired covidien and medtronic inc collectively the transactions following the consummation of the transactions medtronic inc and covidien became subsidiaries of the company in connection with the transactions the company became the successor registrant to medtronic inc and reregistered as a public limited company organized under the laws of ireland for fiscal year 2015 the results of operations of covidien are reflected in the companys results of operations for only the fourth quarter due to the timing of the acquisition of covidien which affects comparability throughout this annual report on form 10k 

organization of financial information      

management’s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures designed to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 

statements that are forwardlooking and not historical in nature are subject to risks and uncertainties see item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k and cautionary factors that may affect future results in this managements discussion and analysis for more information 

the consolidated financial statements are presented within item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and include the consolidated statements of income consolidated statements of comprehensive income consolidated balance sheets consolidated statements of equity consolidated statements of cash flows and the related notes which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements 

financial trends     

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that management uses to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures to facilitate management’s review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning management believes that nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company’s ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations the nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company’s operations investors should not consider results reflecting nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap and are cautioned that medtronic may calculate results reflecting nongaap financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies 

the gaap to nongaap reconciliation presents nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends but which include charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated because the effective rate may be significantly affected by the nongaap adjustments that take place during the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the provision for income taxes adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities 

refer to the “gaap to nongaap reconciliation income taxes and summary of cash flows sections for reconciliations of our results of operations prepared in accordance with us gaap to the adjusted nongaap financial measures considered by management

net income attributable to medtronic for fiscal year 2017  was 40 billion  289  per diluted share as compared to net income attributable to medtronic of 35 billion  248  per diluted share for fiscal year 2016  representing an increase of 14 percent and 17 percent respectively 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  



 currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 34 million  on net sales for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016 when using the average exchange rates in effect during fiscal year 2016  net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was also unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 resulting from our 5253 week fiscal year calendar in addition the fiscal year 2017  acquisitions of heartware and smith  nephews gynecology business contributed 200 million  to our total net sales growth 

our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies therapy innovation globalization and economic value we are creating competitive advantages and capitalizing on the longterm trends in healthcare namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes the growing demand for expanded access to care and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems in our therapy innovation growth strategy we continue to see strong adoption of our products across all our operating segments further discussion about our products is included within the operating segment sections below in globalization net sales in emerging markets and nonus developed markets grew 7 percent  and 4 percent  respectively in fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  in our third growth strategy economic value we continue to execute our valuebased healthcare signature programs and remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume see our discussion in the “net sales” section of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on the results of our operating segments 

gaap to nongaap reconciliation we have provided nongaap financial measures because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented management uses these nongaap financial measures to facilitate its review of our operational performance and as a basis for strategic planning management believes that nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations refer to our discussion in the costs and expenses and income taxes sections of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on the nongaap adjustments investors should not consider results reflecting nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap and should be cautioned that we may calculate results reflecting nongaap financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies 



 

 



 

gaap diluted eps and nongaap diluted eps for fiscal year 2017 were 289  and 460  per diluted share respectively as compared to 248  and 437  per diluted share respectively for fiscal year 2016 representing an increase of 17 and 5 respectively gaap diluted eps and nongaap diluted eps growth key contributors included realization of over 600 million in synergy savings since the acquisition of covidien coupled with our revenue growth 

critical accounting estimates 

we have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect managements best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

revenue recognition rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and other relevant information we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and recognize such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant price adjustment rebates charged against gross sales were 30 billion and 29 billion in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively and 679 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 

litigation contingencies    we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property disputes shareholder related matters environmental proceedings income tax disputes and governmental proceedings and investigations in the us and around the world the outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages as well as other civil or criminal remedies including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving us are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and while it is not possible to predict the outcome for 

most of the matters discussed we believe it is possible that costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

income tax reserves    we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value including projected future cash flows we assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired goodwill was 385 billion  and 415 billion  at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  respectively 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rates asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates definitelived intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 228 billion  and 262 billion  at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  respectively 

we assess the impairment of indefinitelived intangibles annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangibles require us to make several estimates about fair value including projected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rates indefinitelived intangible assets were 594 million  and 721 million  at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  respectively 

contingent consideration contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at estimated fair value and is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized within acquisitionrelated items  in our consolidated statements of income changes to the fair value of contingent consideration may result from changes in the estimated timing and amount of revenue in the timing or probability of achieving the milestones which trigger payment or in discount rates the fair value of contingent consideration was 246 million  and 377 million  at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  respectively 

net sales 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we amended the way in which we evaluate performance and allocate resources with the acquisition of covidien as a result we began to operate under four reportable segments and four operating segments the cardiac and vascular group composed of cardiac rhythm  heart failure coronary  structural heart and aortic  peripheral vascular divisions the minimally invasive therapies group composed of surgical solutions and patient monitoring  recovery divisions the restorative therapies group and the diabetes group 

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we realigned the divisions within the restorative therapies group the restorative therapies group consists of the following divisions spine brain therapies pain therapies and specialty therapies see note 22  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion related to our segment reporting 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment and division for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  





cardiac and vascular group 

the cardiac and vascular group’s products include pacemakers insertable and external cardiac monitors cardiac resynchronization therapy devices crtd implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd leads and delivery systems ventricular assist systems ablation products electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents balloons and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products the cardiac and vascular group also includes care management services and cath lab managed services clms within the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 105 billion  an increase of 3  percent compared to fiscal year 2016 currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 37 million  as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the cardiac and vascular group’s net sales for fiscal year 2017  were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2017  as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 benefited from strong net sales in arrhythmia management within cardiac rhythm  heart failure largely due to growth in af solutions and diagnostics coronary  structural heart largely due to transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us and europe and in aortic  peripheral vascular as well as the acquisition of heartware in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 56 billion  an increase of 3 percent  compared to fiscal year 2016 cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2017  was driven by strong growth in arrhythmia management largely due to growth in af solutions and diagnostics the strong growth in af solutions was driven by the continued global acceptance of our arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system including strong growth in japan the strong growth in diagnostics was driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor cardiac rhythm  heart failure also benefited from the acquisition of heartware which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 31 billion  an increase of 1 percent  compared to fiscal year 2016 coronary  structural heart net sales growth for fiscal year 2017  was largely driven by the continued launch of the evolut r 

34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us and europe net sales growth was partially offset by challenges with drugeluting stents in both the us and japan due to competitive pressures related to the anticipated approval of the resolute onyx drugeluting stents in these countries which received us fda approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and is expected to receive approval in japan during the summer of fiscal year 2018 net sales growth was also partially offset by continued pricing pressures and competition worldwide in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 17 billion  an increase of 6 percent  compared to fiscal year 2016 aortic  peripheral vascular net sales growth for fiscal year 2017 was driven by the continued strong worldwide growth of the inpact admiral drugcoated balloon as well as success of the helifx endoanchor system and the endurant iis aortic stent graft net sales growth as compared to fiscal year 2016 was also driven by the launch of the hawkone 6 french directional atherectomy system in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 

the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 102 billion  an increase of 9  percent compared to fiscal year 2015 the cardiac and vascular group’s fiscal year 2016 performance was favorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the cardiac and vascular group’s performance for fiscal year 2016 also benefited from the addition of the covidien peripheral business into the aortic  peripheral vascular division in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and strong net sales across all three divisions 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 55 billion  an increase of 4  percent compared to fiscal year 2015 the increase in cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales was driven by strong growth in af solutions with the continued global acceptance of our arctic front system additionally net sales were driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor and the launch of the evera mri surescan icd in the us during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with continued strong adoption through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 net sales for the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division were also affected by continued pricing pressures 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 31 billion  an increase of 2  percent compared to fiscal year 2015 net sales were driven by the corevalve evolut r recapturable system in the us which was launched late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and a strong corevalve launch in japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 in addition net sales of coronary  structural heart division were driven by drugeluting stents including the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in europe and the resolute integrity drugeluting stent in the us and the recent launches of the nc euphora and sc euphora balloon dilatation catheters  net sales were partially offset by continued pricing pressures in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 16 billion  an increase of 52  percent compared to fiscal year 2015 the aortic  peripheral vascular division net sales performance benefited from the addition of the covidien peripheral business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 the increase in aortic  peripheral vascular net sales was driven by strong growth of the inpact admiral drugcoated balloon in the us and globally continued strength in valiant captiva taa stent graft sales continued solid adoption of our aptus helifx endoanchor and continued adoption of the endurant iis abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa 3piece system in the us net sales for the aortic  peripheral vascular division were affected by increased competition in international markets and reimbursement cuts in japan 

looking ahead we expect our cardiac and vascular group could be affected by the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



minimally invasive therapies group   

the minimally invasive therapies group’s products span the entire continuum of care with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract lungs pelvic region kidneys obesity and preventable complications the products include those for advanced and general surgical care wound closure electrosurgery products hernia mechanical devices mesh implants advanced ablation interventional lung ventilators capnography airway products sensors monitors compression dialysis enteral feeding wound care and medical surgical products the minimally invasive therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2017 were  99 billion  an increase of 4 percent compared to fiscal year 2016 currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of 17 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the minimally invasive therapies groups net sales growth in fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the minimally invasive therapies groups net sales for fiscal year 2017  as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016 benefited from strong net sales in surgical solutions largely due to growth in advanced stapling and advanced energy and patient monitoring  recovery largely due to airways and ventilation management as well as the acquisition of smith  nephews gynecology business in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and bellco in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

surgical solutions net sales for fiscal year 2017 were  55 billion  an increase of 5 percent compared to fiscal year 2016 surgical solutions net sales growth was driven by advanced stapling and advanced energy advanced stapling growth resulted from strong adoption of endo stapling specialty reloads with tristaple technology growth in emerging markets and the release of the signia power stapling system advanced energy growth resulted from the launch of the ligasure vessel sealing instruments and continued adoption of the valleylab ft10 energy platform the launch of new ligasure vessel sealing instruments along with the 

valleylab ft10 energy platform helped mitigate the negative impact of reprocessing surgical solutions also benefited from the acquisition of smith  nephews gynecology business which was acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 

patient monitoring  recovery net sales for fiscal year 2017 were  44 billion  an increase of 3 percent compared to fiscal year 2016 patient monitoring  recovery net sales growth was driven by strong airways and ventilation management sales of the puritan bennett 980 strength in patient monitoring nellcor pulse oximetry products and growth in emerging markets patient monitoring  recovery also benefited from the acquisition of bellco which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 

surgical solutions net sales for fiscal year 2016 were 53 billion the net sales performance in surgical solutions was mainly attributable to advanced stapling and advanced energy advanced stapling products benefited from continued worldwide market adoption of the endo gia reinforced reload advanced energy products benefited from continued strong adoption of the ligasure maryland jaw and valleylab ft10 energy platform further early technologies product performance was driven primarily by our gastrointestinal product line 

patient monitoring  recovery net sales for fiscal year 2016 were 43 billion net sales contributions in patient monitoring  recovery were driven mainly by us sales within airways and ventilation management patient monitoring patient care nutritional insufficiency deep vein thrombosis and renal care solutions airways and ventilation management and patient monitoring performance was attributable to airway products acute ventilator sales and sensors patient care net sales results were primarily due to sales of incontinence wound care and sharpsafety product lines and sales within our electrode products the nutritional insufficiency and deep vein thrombosis net sales were largely driven by sales of enteral feeding and compression product lines renal care solutions results were primarily due to sales of dialysis products 

looking ahead we expect our minimally invasive therapies group could be affected by the following 





restorative therapies group   

the restorative therapies groups products focus on various areas of the spine bone graft substitutes biologic products trauma implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain movement disorders obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd overactive bladder urinary retention fecal incontinence and gastroparesis as well as products to treat conditions of the ear nose and throat and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments the restorative therapies group also manufactures and sells imageguided surgery and intraoperative imaging systems and therapies to treat diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain including coils neurovascular stents and flow diversion products the restorative therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 74 billion  an increase of 2 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the restorative therapies groups net sales were unfavorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the restorative therapies group’s performance for fiscal year 2017  was driven by solid growth in brain and specialty therapies partially offset by declines in pain therapies see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 26 billion  flat compared to fiscal year 2016  spine net sales were driven by growth in bmp due to strong us sales offset by declines in europe due to the inductos stop shipment due to suspension in the eu core spine had net sales growth in the us due to new product launches including the solera voyager and elevate expandable cage in conjunction with the speed to scale initiative which involves faster innovation cycles and launching a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market and growth in implants due to the success of our surgical synergy strategy offset by market softness in europe and the middle east driven by the macroeconomic conditions inductos returned to the european market in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 

brain therapies net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 21 billion  an increase of 6 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  the increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in both neurovascular and neurosurgery neurovascular net sales growth was driven by growth in coils from the axium prime extra soft detachable coil growth in flow diversion from the pipeline flex embolization device and growth in stents due to the solitaire revascularization device partially offset by declines due to a voluntary recall of certain product lines in the second quarter neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong sales of navigation capital equipment disposables and the oarm o2 surgical imaging system despite competitive pressure brain modulation drove net sales growth with us sales of the mr conditional activa dbs portfolio and through updated parkinson’s disease labeling for patients with recent onset of motor complications 

specialty therapies net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 15 billion  an increase of 5 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  the increase in net sales was driven by strong growth in advanced energy and pelvic health and growth in ent net sales growth in advanced energy was driven by the sales of the aquamantys transcollation and peak plasmablade products net sales growth in pelvic health was driven by strong interstim implant growth in the us net sales growth in ent continues to benefit from strong adoption of new products including nuvent balloons and fusion compact navigation 

pain therapies net sales for fiscal year 2017  were 11 billion  a decrease of 4 percent  as compared to fiscal year 2016  the decrease in net sales was driven by declines in sales of spinal cord stimulation products due to competitive pressures in the us partially offset by growth in interventional from the osteocool rf spinal tumor ablation system 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 26 billion  a decrease of 1 percent  compared to fiscal year 2015  the decrease in spine net sales was driven by declines in core spine partially offset by growth in bmp composed of infuse bone graft inductos in the eu in the us the us core spine market grew in the lowsingle digits with modest procedural growth offset by continued pricing pressures during fiscal year 2016 new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement in the core spine growth rate we saw incremental revenue from our differentiated olif procedures as well as from the recent solera voyager elevate and ptc interbody launches for tlif and midlf procedures in core spine we are realized some early benefits from our speed to scale initiative which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the market in bmp strong growth in the us was offset by declines in international bmp due to the inductos stop shipment in europe

operations by market geography 

the charts below illustrate net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  

the table below illustrates net sales by market geography for each of our operating segments for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015 



 for fiscal year 2017  net sales for the us increased 1 percent developed markets outside the us increased 4 percent and emerging markets increased 7 percent compared to fiscal year 2016  net sales growth across all markets was driven by meaningful product launches and introduction of groundbreaking new technologies partially offset by an unfavorable impact of an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 net sales growth in the us was led by strong growth in the cardiac and vascular group and minimally invasive therapies group and solid growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes in emerging markets net sales growth was also attributable to the expansion of access to our therapies 

for fiscal year 2016  net sales for the us increased 45 percent nonus developed markets increased 37 percent and emerging markets increased 43 percent over fiscal year 2015 the growth in all markets was primarily driven by the addition of minimally invasive therapies group net sales totaling 96 billion for fiscal year 2016 and was also favorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 net sales growth in the us was led by strong growth in the cardiac and vascular group and solid growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes 

net sales in nonus developed and emerging markets are accompanied by certain financial risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and collection of receivables which typically have longer payment terms we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business however a significant amount of our outstanding 

accounts receivable are with international customers we continue to monitor the economic conditions and the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable from our international customers although we do not currently foresee a significant credit risk associated with a material portion of these receivables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of the countries we serve 

costs and expenses 

cost of products sold   



we continue to focus on reducing our costs of products sold thus increasing gross profit through supply chain management and changes to our manufacturing network gross margin percent was 687 percent  683 percent  and 689 percent  in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively gross margin percent in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015 largely due to the change in product mix as a result of the covidien acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 gross margin percent changes in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  as compared to the same periods in the respective prior fiscal year were also affected by a 38 million charge during fiscal year 2017  related to the recognition of the fair value stepup of acquired heartware inventory as compared to a 226 million  charge and 623 million  charge during fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively related to the recognition of the fair value stepup of acquired covidien inventory 

research and development  selling general and administrative expense 

the following is a summary of research and development and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 



research and development    we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare 

research and development expense for both fiscal years 2017  and 2016  was 22 billion  as compared to 16 billion  in fiscal year 2015  research and development expense decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales over the threeyear period due in part to the timing of clinical trials and product approvals during fiscal year 2017  we continued to invest in new technologies to support our mission through continued product growth 

selling general and administrative  our goal is to continue to leverage selling general and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions selling general and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries and wages as well as other administrative costs such as professional fees and marketing expenses 

selling general and administrative expense was 97 billion  95 billion  and 69 billion  during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively selling general and administrative expense remained fairly flat as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year 2016  to 2017  with a slight decrease due to cost savings associated with selling general and administrative expense initiatives we continue to execute on our cost synergies from the covidien acquisition and transition to centers of excellence in our enabling functions 

other costs and expenses 



special charge    during fiscal year 2017  in continuing our commitment to improve the health of people and communities throughout the world we made a 100 million charitable cash contribution to meet the multiyear funding needs of the medtronic foundation a related party nonprofit organization

restructuring charges    we incur restructuring charges in connection with our costreduction and productivity initiatives or with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations amounts recognized as restructuring charges result from a series of judgments and estimates about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on assumptions upon implementation of the initiative programs 

we began our restructuring program related to the acquisition of covidien the cost synergies initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we anticipate approximately 850 million in cost synergies to be achieved as a result of the covidien acquisition through fiscal year 2018 including administrative office optimization manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure and certain general and administrative savings restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in future fiscal years as cost synergy initiatives are finalized restructuring charges are expected to be primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturing and facility closures 

our restructuring reserve balances at april 28 2017  april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  were 291 million  250 million  and 143 million  respectively during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized restructuring charges of 441 million  332 million  and 248 million  respectively for fiscal year 2017 the restructuring charges included 73 million  of incremental defined benefit pension and postretirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages for further discussion on the incremental defined benefit pension and postretirement related expenses see note 17  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

the restructuring charges during fiscal years 2017  and 2016  were partially offset by reversals of excess restructuring reserves of 68 million  and 18 million  respectively reversals of restructuring reserves relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the company cancellations of employee terminations and employee termination costs being less than initially estimated for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  restructuring charges of 10 million 9 million and 15 million respectively were recognized within cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income

other expense net    other expense net includes royalty income and expense realized equity security gains and losses currency transaction and derivative gains and losses impairment charges on equity securities puerto rico excise tax and us medical device excise tax in fiscal year 2017  other expense net was  222 million  as compared to  107 million  in fiscal year 2016  the largest contributor to the change in other expense net was a decrease in net currency gains partially offset by the decrease in us medical device tax due to the suspension of the us medical device tax beginning january 1 2016 total net currency gains recognized in other expense net  were 81 million in fiscal year 2017  compared to gains of 314 million in fiscal year 2016  

in fiscal year 2016  other expense net was  107 million  a decrease of 11 million from  118 million  in fiscal year 2015  the largest contributor to the change in other expense net   was was an increase in net currency gains partially offset by increased royalty expense within minimally invasive therapies group total net currency gains recognized in other expense net  were 314 million in fiscal year 2016  compared to gains of 196 million in fiscal year 2015  

interest expense net    interest expense net includes interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts and ineffectiveness on interest rate derivative instruments in fiscal year 2017  interest expense net was 728 million  compared to 955 million  in fiscal year 2016  the decrease in interest expense net for fiscal year 2017  was the result of a 183 million charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities in fiscal year 2016  and a 45 million loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year 2016  

in fiscal year fiscal year 2016  interest expense net was 955 million  compared to  280 million  in fiscal year 2015 the increase in interest expense net for fiscal year 2016  was driven by an increase in total debt primarily resulting from the covidien acquisition a 183 million  charge recorded in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain debt securities and a 45 million  loss on interest rate swaps which were entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that was no longer anticipated in fiscal year 2016  

income taxes 



our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 126 percent compared to 184 percent in fiscal year 2016 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was due to the net tax impact of inventory stepup debt tender premium certain litigation payments certain tax adjustments operational tax benefits described below and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 162 percent compared to 158 percent in fiscal year 2016 the increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2017 we recognized   95 million of operational tax benefits the operational tax benefits included a 44 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a 51 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves and changes to certain deferred income tax balances 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 184 percent compared to 233 percent in fiscal year 2015 the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to the net tax impact of inventory stepup debt tender premium acquisitionrelated items certain tax adjustments amortization of intangible assets the impact from the acquisition of covidien operational tax benefits described below and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 158 percent compared to 182 percent in fiscal year 2015 the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the covidien acquisition operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2016 we recognized 97 million of operational tax benefits the retroactive renewal and extension of the us federal research and development tax credit resulted in a 16 million operational tax benefit for fiscal year 2016 in addition we recognized a 40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a 41 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 of approximately   76 million 74 million and 58 million respectively 

certain tax adjustments    

during fiscal year 2017 we recognized certain tax adjustments of 202 million which included the following 



 the 202 million net certain tax adjustment was recognized in provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2017

 the 349 million certain tax adjustment was recognized in provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2015 

certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider these nongaap adjustments refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further analysis related to these adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 



 we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility in the future approximately 6 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and investments held by certain uscontrolled nonus subsidiaries may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes however we believe our other existing cash cash equivalents and investments as well as our 35 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program 901 million outstanding at april 28 2017  will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months including repayment of current debt obligations we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

in march 2017 medtronic luxco issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate face value of 1850 billion resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 1850 billion net of premiums discounts and issuance costs the first tranche consisted of 10 billion of 1700 percent senior notes due 2019 the second tranche consisted of 850 million of 3350 percent senior notes due 2027 concurrent with the offering by medtronic luxco medtronic inc issued 150 million in principal amount of its 4625 percent senior notes due 2045 the reopening notes the reopening notes are a further issuance of and form a single series 

with the 40 billion principal amount of the previously outstanding 4625 percent senior notes due 2045 we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in april 2016 we completed a cash tender offer and redemption of 27 billion  of senior notes for 30 billion  of total consideration we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 163 million  which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums the loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income in addition to the loss on debt extinguishment we recognized 20 million  of interest expense due to the acceleration of net losses on forward starting interest rate derivatives which were terminated at the time of original debt issuances relating to the portion of debt extinguished in the tender offer 



 

standard  poors ratings services sp and moodys investors service moodys longterm debt ratings and shortterm debt ratings at april 28 2017  were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 29 2016  we do not expect the sp and moodys ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and our 35 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program discussed above and within the “debt and capital” section of this managements discussion and analysis 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

note 20  to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to significant legal proceedings in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs however we evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include us government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities debt funds and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss 

for fiscal year 2017  the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recognized all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost however at april 28 2017  we have 242 million  of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate current and noncurrent availableforsale debt securities of 87 billion  if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary 

impairment in the future which could adversely impact our financial results management is required to use estimates and assumptions in its valuation of our investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding fair value measurements 

summary of cash flows 



operating activities    the 17 billion increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable collections as well as a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest of 350 million and 132 million respectively and a 191 million payment in fiscal year 2016  related to the covidien tax sharing agreement the increase in cash from accounts receivable was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue the decrease in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of payments made for the resolution of the kyphon acquisitionrelated matters as well as covidien income tax extension payments in fiscal year 2016  we did not make any significant tax audit settlement payments or significant extension payments in fiscal year 2017  the decrease in cash paid for interest was the result of less debt on average in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  

the 316 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization loss on debt extinguishment and acquisitionrelated items of 21 billion and a decrease in certain litigation payments of 469 million partially offset by an increase in cash paid for incomes taxes and interest of 747 million and 688 million respectively the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of the settlement payments made for the resolution of the kyphon acquisitionrelated matters covidien income tax extension payments and the impacts from the full year of covidien results the increase in cash paid for interest was primarily the result of a full year of interest payments on the senior notes and term loan issued in fiscal year 2015  primarily to fund the covidien acquisition as well as the interest payments on the outstanding debt assumed as part of the covidien acquisition the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also higher due to the impact of a full year of operations postcovidien acquisition 

investing activities   the 38 billion increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments in fiscal year 2017  

the 193 billion increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily attributable to the covidien acquisition in fiscal year 2015  as well as an increase in the net proceeds from purchases and sales of investments in fiscal year 2016  

financing activities     the 63 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily attributable to the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes an increase in commercial paper borrowings and lower payments on maturing and extinguished debt partially offset by increases in dividends to shareholders and repurchases of ordinary shares 

the 254 billion increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily attributable to higher issuances of debt in fiscal year 2015  primarily related to the covidien acquisition further contributing to the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 were higher payments on maturing and extinguished debt increased dividends to shareholders and increased repurchases of ordinary shares 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting additions to property plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our 

reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs current debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations at april 28 2017  was 75 billion  compared to 993 million  at april 29 2016  we utilize senior notes to meet our longterm financing needs longterm debt at april 28 2017  was 259 billion  compared to 301 billion  at april 29 2016  

total debt at april 28 2017  was 334 billion  compared to 311 billion  at april 29 2016  the increase in total debt was primarily driven by the issuance of three tranches of the 2017 senior notes with an aggregate face value of 20 billion in march 2017 we will use these funds for general corporate purposes 

we maintain a commercial paper program for shortterm financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion at april 28 2017  we had 901 million  of commercial paper outstanding no amount of commercial paper was outstanding under this program at april 29 2016  during fiscal years 2017  and 2016  the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 39  and 49  days respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 089 percent  and 057 percent  respectively the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion syndicated line of credit facility 35 billion revolving credit facility which expires in january 2020 the 35 billion revolving credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes the 35 billion revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional 500 million at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the 35 billion revolving credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date we could also request a one year extension of the maturity date at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit 

interest rates on advances on our 35 billion revolving credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp and moodys refer to liquidity and capital resources section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with at april 28 2017  

interestbearing debt as a percentage of total interestbearing debt and equity was 40 percent  at april 28 2017  and 37 percent  at april 29 2016  for further discussion on debt see the “liquidity and capital resources section of this management’s discussion and analysis the indentures under which the senior notes have been issued contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with at april 28 2017  

we repurchase shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders in january 2015 our board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the adoption of the existing medtronic inc share redemption program at april 29 2016  we had used all of the 80 million  shares authorized under the january 2015 share redemption program in june 2015 our board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the redemption of an additional 80 million  of our ordinary shares at april 29 2016  we had used 8 million of the 80 million shares authorized under the june 2015 share redemption program during fiscal years 2017  and 2016  we repurchased a total of 43 million  and 38 million  shares respectively under these programs at an average price of 8303  and 7492  respectively at april 28 2017  we had approximately 29 million  shares remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in june 2017 our board of directors replaced the existing june 2015 authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of 5 billion  beginning june 26 2017 to redeem ordinary shares

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes in periods in which the us dollar our functional currency is strengtheningweakening as compared to other currencies our revenues expenses assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies may be translated into us dollars at a lowerhigher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment 

we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the euro and japanese yen fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 28 2017  and april 29 2016  was 108 billion  at april 28 2017  these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of 118 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 28 2017  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies the fair value of these contracts would increasedecrease by approximately 836 million any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our shortterm investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio at april 28 2017  was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars of which approximately 85 is fixed rate debt and approximately 15 is floatingrate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates compared to interest rates at april 28 2017  indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 67 million

other factors impacting our operations 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate can be subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

during fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  we spent 22 billion   77  percent of net sales 16 billion   81  percent of net sales and 15 billion   87  percent of net sales on rd respectively our rd activities include improving existing products and 

therapies expanding their indications and applications for use and developing new therapies and procedures we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets clinical evidence generation and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers 

acquisitions and investments 

our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients health and extend lives requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop an allencompassing portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our rd efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon acquisitions investments and alliances to provide access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas and markets 

we expect to make future investments or acquisitions where we believe that we can stimulate the development of or acquire new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

for additional information see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k and item 1a risk factors  failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business

patents and licenses 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology we have filed and obtained numerous patents in the us and abroad and regularly file patent applications worldwide in our continuing effort to establish and protect our proprietary technology us patents typically have a 20year term from the application date while patent protection outside the us varies from country to country in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies we have also obtained certain trademarks and tradenames for our products to distinguish our genuine products from our competitors’ products and we maintain certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business as a whole our efforts to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights have included ongoing review of thirdparty patents and patent applications for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

markets and distribution methods 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business acquired through the covidien acquisition we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns primarily through thirdparty distributors although we also have direct sales representatives we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our three largest markets are the us western europe and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide  including physicians hospitals other medical institutions and gpos to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products we believe that we maintain excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry that enable us to gain a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments trends and emerging opportunities and respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and patients we attempt to enhance our presence in the medical community through active participation in medical meetings and by conducting comprehensive training and educational activities we believe that these activities contribute to physician expertise 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among hospitals and other customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power this enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendors our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition and industry 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160  countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in addition in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country often with longerterm receivables than are typical in the us currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect revenues net of expenses and cash flows from operations outside the us we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k in addition the repatriation of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the us may result in substantial us tax cost 

for financial reporting purposes net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture most of our products at 89 manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world for additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to item 2 in this annual report on form 10k we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability due to the us fda’s requirements regarding manufacturing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our operations we have reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries pursuant to these requirements we are required to report on form sd the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2015 calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

working capital practices 

our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers 

employees 

on april 29 2016  we employed more than 88000  fulltime employees our employees are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment 

seasonality 

worldwide sales including us sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere particularly in european countries in addition pulse oximetry sales can be impacted by flu season 

government regulation and other considerations 

our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda and similar agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products our business is also affected by patient privacy laws cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations the primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below 

the laws applicable to us are subject to change and are subject to evolving interpretations if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations medtronic and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial fines and damages and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 

product approval processes 

authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device or technology in the us is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device or technology in this process we must submit data that supports our equivalence claim if human clinical data is required it must be gathered in compliance with us fda investigational device exemption regulations we must receive an order from the us fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we can commercially distribute the new medical device or technology modifications to cleared medical devices or technologies can be made without using the 510k process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness minimally invasive therapies group products are generally subject to the premarket notification process a very small number of our devices are exempt from premarket review 

the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval pma requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective we do this by collecting data regarding design materials bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device the us fda will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective this determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device this process is much more detailed timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process a third seldom used process for approval exists for humanitarian use devices intended for patient populations of less than 4000 patients per year in the us this exemption is similar to the pma process however a full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trials is not required the threshold for approving these products is probable benefit and safety 

many countries outside the us to which we export medical devices also subject such medical devices and technologies to their own regulatory requirements frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a country outside of the us prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device or technology and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing it is possible that laws and regulations may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute products 

in the eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes a notified body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive medtronic is subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance the competent authorities of the eu countries generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner various penalties exist for noncompliance with the laws transcribing the medical device directives we anticipate a new medical device regulation to be published by the european union in 2016 and it is likely to impose additional premarket and postmarket requirements 

to be sold in japan most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval or “shonin” the japanese government through the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical devices under the pharmaceutical affairs law pal oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda a quasigovernment organization performing many of the review functions for mhlw penalties for a company’s noncompliance with pal could be severe including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions mhlw and pmda also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the pal medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies 

our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on 

existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future there can be no assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or costeffective manner or approved at all 

ongoing us fda regulations 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations the us fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the us fda for compliance with the us fda’s quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other us regulatory bodies including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the u s department of justice and various state attorneys general monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products although surgeons are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the us fda the us fda has prohibited manufacturers from promoting products for such “offlabel” uses and has taken the position that manufacturers can only market their products for cleared or approved uses 

if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices the us fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the u s department of justice conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by thirdparty payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the us fda relating to our neuromodulation business’ synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires the company to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree limits the companys ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system unless specific conditions are met the agreement does not require the retrieval of any of the company’s products but the company must retain a thirdparty expert to inspect the neuromodulation quality system and to provide a certification that the system complies with the requirements of the consent decree once this certification is accepted by the us fda and a us fda inspection is successfully completed the limitations on manufacturer and distribution of synchromed pumps will be lifted thereafter the company must submit periodic audit reports to the us fda to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree 

in june 2016 tyrx inc received a warning letter from the us fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey the company is taking action to address the warning letter and has submitted a response to the us fda 

governmental trade regulations 

the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations both in the us and in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across international borders because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities these laws and regulations govern among other things our import and export activities 

the us fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance medtronic is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by several us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department we import raw materials components and finished products into the countries in which we transact business we act as the importer of record in many instances but we also sell and ship goods to third parties who are themselves responsible for complying with applicable trade laws and regulations in our role as importer of record we are directly responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations concerning the importation of our raw materials components and 

finished products if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or such third parties were not in compliance with applicable us fda or customs laws and regulations when engaging in crossborder transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability depending on the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability in addition such determinations may cause supply chain disruptions and delays in the distribution of our products that impact our business activities 

many countries including the us control the export and reexport of goods technology and services for reasons including public health national security regional stability antiterrorism policies and other reasons in certain circumstances approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods technology or services are exported or reexported to certain destinations to certain endusers and for certain enduses in addition international sales of our medical devices that have not received us fda approval are subject to us fda export requirements some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or the third parties through which we export goods were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability similarly such determinations may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products or result in restrictions being placed upon our international distribution and sales of products which may materially impact our business activities 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their controlledinfact subsidiaries and affiliates outside the us are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and a foreign country currently the us considers the arab league boycott of israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott we are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirements of us antiboycott laws for all transactions in which we are involved if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services are determined to have violated us antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability penalties for any violations of antiboycott laws and regulations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines imprisonment debarment from government contracts loss of export privileges and the denial of certain tax benefits including foreign tax credits and outside us subsidiary deferrals 

data privacy and security laws and regulations 

the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the us federal and state international and industry levels us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers for example the us fda has issued guidance advising manufacturers to review their cybersecurity practices and policies to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized access or modification to their medical devices or compromise of the security of the hospital network that may be connected to the device moreover in april 2003 the us department of health and human services hhs published patient privacy rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and in april 2005 published security rules for protected health information the hipaa privacy and security rules govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims health plans and health care clearinghouses in 2009 congress passed the hitech act which modified certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rules for covered entities and their business associates which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce these included directing hhs to publish more specific security standards and increasing breach notification requirements as well as tightening certain aspects of the privacy rules hhs published the final versions of these new rules in january 2013 and covered entities and business associates were expected to be in compliance by september 2013 in addition the hitech act provided that business associates will now be subject to the same security requirements as covered entities and that with regard to both the security and privacy rule business associates will be subject to direct enforcement by hhs including civil and criminal liability just as covered entities are in the past hipaa has generally affected us indirectly but these modifications increase the potential for enforcement action against us as a business associate medtronic is generally not a covered entity except for our diabetes business medtronic monitoring inc and our health insurance plans medtronic only operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances in those cases the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information 

a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices such as state laws that govern the use disclosure and protection of social security numbers or that are designed to protect credit card account data 

state and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information including information related to consumers and care providers 

we are also impacted by the privacy requirements of countries outside the united states privacy standards in europe and asia are becoming increasingly strict enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the eu are growing and new laws and restrictions are being passed in april of 2016 the european council and the parliament adopted the new general data protection regulation which sets demanding requirements for the management of individually identifiable data in the eu 

the management of cross border transfers of information among and outside of eu member countries is becoming more complex which may complicate our clinical research activities as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data china and russia have passed socalled “data localization” laws which require multinational companies that store certain individually identifiable data on their citizens to maintain that data on servers located in their country restrictions on transfer or processing of that data may apply as well the restrictions may complicate our operations in those countries adding complexity and additional management and oversight needs and the chinese and russian governments are still clarifying how they will apply and enforce these laws 

cost containment initiatives 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs hospitals which purchase implants are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

some thirdparty payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private thirdparty payers in addition some private thirdparty payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement international examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms in markets significant to medtronics business include japan where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures as a result of our manufacturing efficiencies cost controls and other costsavings initiatives we believe we are wellpositioned to respond to changes resulting from the worldwide trend toward costcontainment however uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation new or changed coverage and reimbursement government or private payer policies or decisions or other reforms making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of costcontainment trends on future operating results 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services 

us federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded health care programs the principal us federal laws include 1 the antikickback statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing ordering recommending making referrals to items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program 2 the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federallyfunded health care program including claims resulting from a violation of the antikickback statute 3 the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients 

to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider and 4 health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payer there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other health care programs and private thirdparty payers insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico in addition as a manufacturer the us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals further the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa can be used to prosecute companies in the us for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the us if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in legislative regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the us and abroad or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us similar to other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials to the best of our knowledge at this time we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position andor cash flows 

litigation risks 

patent litigation  we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

product liability and other claims    we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class we are also susceptible to other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation these claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes goods and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows  ” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

insurance 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on costs and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy providing coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future based on historical loss trends we believe that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends however may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in us involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company however the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our businesses and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to the company 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160  countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our products or proposed products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

competitive factors include 

 we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry 

reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture most of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities located throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability however we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and to make our related product sales 

other problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost 

moreover pursuant to the conflict minerals requirements promulgated by the sec as a part of doddfrank we are required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials we will continue to incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to evaluate the source of any conflict minerals in our products and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of our raw materials 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater regulation in the future 

our medical devices and technologies and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations and an aggressive enforcement environment including by the us fda u s department of justice health and human servicesoffice of the 

inspector general and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities these authorities and members of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our business we anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda and comparable agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions and cash flows even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance it may 

 both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with the us fda’s requirements including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement since 2009 the us fda has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations including medical device companies by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities the us fda has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of nonus governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the u s department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations 

in addition the us fda has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling a number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “offlabel” uses including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for “offlabel” uses constitute false and fraudulent claims to the government the failure to comply with “offlabel” promotion restrictions can result in significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

pursuant to doddfrank the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries under the rules we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2015 calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free in addition we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that 

certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

governmental regulations outside the us have become increasingly stringent and more common and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future in the european union for example we anticipate a new medical device regulation to be published in 2016 and it is likely to impose additional premarket and postmarket requirements penalties for a company’s noncompliance with governmental regulation could be severe including fines revocation or suspension of a company’s business license mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions any governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents in medical equipment and endoflife disposal and takeback programs and the health and safety of our employees our operations involve the use of substances regulated under such laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we violate these environmental laws and regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

we may in the future be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities including the past activities of companies we have acquired the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flow 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers such as governmental programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable nonus programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services the principal us federal laws implicated include those that prohibit i the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment known as the false claims laws ii unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federallyfunded health care programs known as the antikickback laws and iii health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider known as the stark law many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico in addition as a manufacturer of us fdaapproved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs we are subject to the physician payments sunshine act which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to uslicensed physicians or us teaching hospitals 

our profitability and international operations are subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the us and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the us and abroad or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce 

reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by cms any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation against us can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation we believe the results associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which would generally have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications owned by us may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes goods and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing defects design flaws offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future 

strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services if we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

further we have elected to selfinsure with respect to product liability risks and any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could be costly to defend see our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses any of the foregoing problems including product liability claims or product recalls in the future regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

health care policy changes including us health care reform legislation signed in 2010 may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government state governments regulators and thirdparty payers to control these costs and more generally to reform the us health care system certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 provide for a number of healthcare policy changes that are or will be applicable to us however certain provisions of the law are not yet effective and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood and it is unclear what the full impacts will be from the law the legislation provides for significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 23 percent excise tax on all us medical device sales that commenced in january 2013 although the excise tax has been suspended by congress until the end of 2017 its status is unclear for 2018 and subsequent years under the legislation the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately 20 billion over 10 years the law also focuses on a number of medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies the medicare provisions include valuebased payment programs increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination such as bundled physician and hospital payments additionally the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending we cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation however any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain a portion of our selfinsured program through a whollyowned captive insurance company we continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with a third party insurer that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future although we believe based on historical loss trends that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will suffer 

we may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will be adversely affected 

we may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil gas and other commodities 

we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities oil gas and pulp prices are volatile and may increase resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the costcontainment efforts of our customers and thirdparty payers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

economic and political instability around the world could adversely affect our revenues financial condition or results of operations 

there can be no assurance that economic and political instability around the world will not adversely affect our revenues financial condition or results of operations our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis if at all as with our customers and vendors these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the us failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results 

although our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange we are a global company operations in countries outside of the us which account for approximately 43 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016 are accompanied by certain financial and other risks that would not be faced by a company operating purely within the us we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the us especially in emerging markets which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations our profitability and international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

 there are recent legislative proposals to tax profits of us affiliates which are earned abroad while it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact us they may materially impact our results of operations if for example our profits earned abroad are subject to us income tax or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu although it is unknown what those terms will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

finally changes in currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the us net of expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more frequent voluntary selfdisclosures by companies aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by us and nonus governmental agencies and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors because these parties are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions due to our international operations we are subject to such laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and those in the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and surgical tools and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

in response to a variety of actions by legislators regulators and third party payers to reduce the perceived rise in healthcare costs many health care industry companies including health care systems are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows would suffer 

our business is indirectly subject to health care industry costcontainment measures that could result in reduced sales of medical devices and medical devices containing our components 

most of our customers and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce 

or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that health care providers are instituting both in the us and internationally could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals 

in an effort to reduce costs many existing and potential customers for our products within the us have become members of group purchase organizations gpos and integrated delivery networks idns gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members gpos and idns typically award contracts on a categorybycategory basis through a competitive bidding process bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting processes we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major gpos and idns across our product portfolio furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products thereby reducing our profitability 

while having a contract with a gpo and idn for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that gpo or idn such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained gpos and idns increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a gpo or idn for a certain product category members of the gpo or idn generally are free to purchase from other suppliers furthermore gpo and idn contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days’ notice accordingly although we have multiple contracts with many major gpos and idns the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers if we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our systems and data if our products and services do not operate as intended or we experience a cyberattack or other breach of these systems or products our business could be materially affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations and routinely process store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information in addition many of our products and services incorporate software and information technology that allows patients and physicians to be connected or to collect data regarding a patient and the therapy he or she is receiving 

the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks breakdown destruction loss or compromise of data obsolescence or incompatibility among systems or other significant disruption including power outages and telecommunications failures unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data relating to patients or employees our confidential or proprietary information or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties if third parties successfully hack into or interfere with our implanted or connected products or services they may create issues with product functionality that could pose a risk of loss of data a risk to patient safety and a risk of product recall or field activity we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents and we make ongoing improvements to our informationsharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities in accordance with industry and regulatory standards however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when and if they occur 

we also rely on third party vendors to supply andor support certain aspects of our information technology systems third party systems may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security of our own systems and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems 

in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions with this growth we will continue to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and to upgrade and expand our information system capabilities for stable and secure business operations 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to data protection and cyber security laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and that some of the data we process store and transmit may be transmitted across countries in the us hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of patient medical records and other health information and the federal trade commission has begun to assert authority over protection of privacy and the use of cyber security in information systems particularly in the area of online communications and mobile healthcare applications in which we have a growing presence in europe the general data protection regulation requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the eu and in the event of violations may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue china and russia have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data we believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our business however there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business in addition there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies while medtronic has not been named in any such suits if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur we could become a target of such litigation 

our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities continuing to build security into the design of our products protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could expose patients or employees to financial or medical identity theft suffer a loss of product functionality lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws state laws or the laws of other jurisdictions experience increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences including legal action and damage to our reputation 

negative conditions in global credit markets may impair our ability to issue debt securities including our commercial paper program and the liquidity andor market value of investments in marketable debt securities such as our other fixed income securities which may cause us losses and liquidity issues 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include government and agency securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit debt funds and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities market conditions over the past several years have included periods of significant economic uncertainty and at times general market distress during these periods we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixedincome investment market including the securities in which we invest in the event we need to sell these securities we may not 

be able to do so in a timely manner or for a value that is equal to the underlying principal in addition we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge if we determine that the fair value of such securities is temporarily impaired we would record a temporary impairment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income within shareholders’ equity if it is determined that the fair value of these securities is otherthantemporarily impaired we would record a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

negative market conditions may also impair our ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper or debt securities or may impact our ability to sell such securities at a reasonable price and may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institutions 

our products are continually the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several acquisitions in recent years including the 2015 acquisition of covidien and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

 we also could experience negative effects on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

the expansion of our services and solutions business may not yield the revenue we expect and will expose us to new risks 

we are increasingly focusing on our services and solutions businesses and the creation of comprehensive valuebased healthcare offerings in which payment is based on measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon these offerings include care management services cath lab and operating room managed services and solutions for chronic disease management we intend to expand our services and solutions model across all of our business groups and across geographic regions however we remain in the relatively early stages of developing and implementing this business model as a result we will need to invest significant expense and management resources into developing our expertise and executing our strategies and our efforts may not be profitable 

in addition the expansion of our services and solutions business model will expose us to or increase our exposure to a variety of regulations in the various countries we provide services and solutions including regulations related to government payments fraud and abuse patient privacy and the corporate practice of medicine compliance with these regulations may prove to be more costly than we anticipate and we may not successfully comply with such regulations these regulatory costs may slow our expansion into these business areas and may have a negative effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations into marketing and other business practices these investigations could result in the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to rigorous regulation by the us fda and numerous other federal state and nonus governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice and the office of inspector general of hhs these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices 

we cooperate with these investigations and respond to such requests however when an investigation begins we cannot predict when it will be resolved the outcome of the investigation or its impact on us an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations finally if these investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens including cost on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations or other investigations initiated by a government at any time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

as of april 29 2016 our total consolidated external debt was approximately 312 billion we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business acquisitions and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various jurisdictions outside the us we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example legislation in 2010 imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers for us sales of medical devices beginning in january 2013 proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic incs fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years on december 23 2010 the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues medtronic inc filed a petition with the us tax court on march 21 2011 objecting to the deficiency during october and november 2012 medtronic inc reached a resolution with the irs on various matters including the deductibility of a settlement payment medtronic inc and the irs agreed to hold one issue the calculation of amounts eligible for the onetime repatriation holiday because such issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation with the irs the remaining unresolved issue relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of the companys key manufacturing sites the tax court proceeding with respect to this issue began on february 3 2015 and ended on march 12 2015 the us tax court issued its opinion on june 9 2016 the us tax court generally rejected the irs’s position but also made certain modifications to the medtronic inc tax returns as filed final resolution of this matter is not expected until the end of calendar 2016 or later if the tax court opinion is appealed 

examination and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments which could have a material adverse effect on our and covidien’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

the company has provided reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if the distribution of mallinckrodt ordinary shares to covidien shareholders in 2013 or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

covidien received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i certain transactions effected in connection with its 2013 separation of mallinckrodt qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code and ii the distribution qualifies as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling covidien received a tax opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp in form and substance acceptable to covidien which relied on the effectiveness of the irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code 

the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings in the case of the 2013 separation from covidien and mallinckrodt regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the tax opinions the irs could determine on audit that the 2013 distribution or the related internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the respective facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distributions or if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs rulings 

we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that was entered into with mallinckrodt if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 distribution are taxable 

our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations 

recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence limit the ability of foreignowned corporations to deduct interest expense tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of us corporations impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of us multinational groups and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations 

additionally the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released several components of its 

comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business 

moreover tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from a crossborder business combination such as us which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold which irish revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents 

risks relating to the covidien acquisition the transaction 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating medtronic inc and covidien 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the medtronic inc and covidien businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of medtronic inc and covidien the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the transaction our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien all of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of the medtronic inc and covidien businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the transaction hold 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction does not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test 

in addition changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application 

since section 7874 was enacted there have been various legislative proposals to broaden its scope such proposals could among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation under section 7874 if the former shareholders of the us corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction or if the foreign corporation’s affiliated group has substantial business activities in the us and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in 

the us accordingly if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the transactions such proposals could cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes based on our existing expected cash flows we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

specifically if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we would be subject to us corporate income tax on our worldwide income and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to us tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the us tax rules for controlled foreign corporations cfcs additionally covidiens foreign corporations which are not currently cfcs would become cfcs making them potentially subject to current or future us taxation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the us treasury department and the irs may promulgate rules that would adversely affect our tax position 

the us treasury department has announced that it is examining possible changes in the regulatory rules affecting companies that move their tax domicile outside the us in the event the us treasury department and the irs were to change the applicable regulatory rules we could face potentially substantial tax costs as a result of the transactions we are unable to assess the potential impact of any such possible changes if adopted until they are announced 

on september 22 2014 the us treasury department and the irs issued new guidance announcing their intention to issue regulations interpreting multiple sections of the code including section 7874 to address inversion transactions and transactions that treasury and the irs characterize as “postinversion tax avoidance transactions” the irs notice when issued such regulations would apply to transactions completed on or after september 22 2014 the regulations described in the irs notice would expand the set of circumstances under which section 7874 applies to cause the foreign acquirer of a us corporation to be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes such regulations would also impose additional us taxes on certain transactions involving the acquired us corporation’s cfc’s 

the regulations interpreting section 7874 of the code announced in the irs notice are not expected to cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes however if ultimately upheld by a reviewing court the regulations announced in the irs notice would be expected to limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transactions involving nonus subsidiaries 

in addition in the irs notice the us treasury department and the irs announced their intention to issue additional guidance in the future intended to restrict our ability to undertake certain transactions which could reduce our us tax liability according to the irs notice such guidance may include among other things limitations on our ability to deduct interest on certain intercompany debt for us federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such guidance will be issued the nature of regulations that may be promulgated thereunder or the effect such guidance may have on our business 

the transaction may not allow us to maintain competitive global cash management and a competitive effective corporate tax rate 

while we believe that being incorporated in ireland should help us maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate nor global cash accessibility will be however because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate or global cash accessibility 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the european communities if they had been made between member states of the communities this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt eritrea iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan and syria 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax currently 20 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

 irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

understanding our financial information 

the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries you should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  and for each of the three fiscal years ended april 29 2016  april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  

on january 26 2015 pursuant to the transaction agreement the company acquired covidien and medtronic inc collectively the transactions following the consummation of the transactions medtronic inc and covidien became subsidiaries of the company in connection with the transactions the company became the successor registrant to medtronic inc and reregistered as a public limited company organized under the laws of ireland for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015 the results of operations of covidien are reflected in medtronic’s results of operations for only the fourth quarter due to the timing of the transactions which will affect comparability throughout this annual report on form 10k 

for further information regarding the acquisition see the section entitled acquisition and investments  acquisition of covidien plc in fiscal year 2015 contained in item 1 business and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

organization of financial information      

management’s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures designed to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 

statements that are forwardlooking and not historical in nature are subject to risks and uncertainties see item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k and cautionary factors that may affect future results in this managements discussion and analysis for more information 

the consolidated financial statements are presented within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and include the consolidated statements of income consolidated statements of comprehensive income consolidated balance sheets consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity consolidated statements of cash flows and the related notes which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements 

financial trends     

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we present certain financial measures that management uses to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning however such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap these financial measures are considered nongaap financial measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures to facilitate management’s review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning management believes that nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company’s ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations the nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company’s operations investors should not consider results reflecting nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap and are cautioned that medtronic may calculate results reflecting nongaap financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies 

the gaap to nongaap reconciliation presents nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and may affect financial trends but which include charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods nongaap adjustments 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by these nongaap adjustments that take place in the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is calculated as the provision for income taxes adjusted for the impact of nongaap adjustments as a percentage of income from operations before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows 

refer to the “gaap to nongaap reconciliation income taxes and summary of cash flows sections for reconciliations of our results of operations prepared in accordance with us gaap to the adjusted nongaap measurements considered by management 

our fiscal yearend is the last friday in april and therefore the total weeks in a fiscal year can fluctuate between 52 and 53 weeks fiscal year 2016 was a 53week year with the additional week occurring in the first quarter fiscal years 2015  and 2014  were 52week years 

executive level overview 

medtronic is among the worlds largest medical technology services and solutions companies  alleviating pain restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world we employ more than 88000  fulltime employees worldwide serving physicians hospitals and patients in approximately 160  countries our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders cardiovascular disease advanced and general surgical care respiratory and monitoring solutions neurological disorders spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma urological and digestive disorders and ear nose and throat and diabetes conditions 

net income for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  was 35 billion  248  per diluted share as compared to net income of 27 billion  241  per diluted share for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  representing an increase of 32 percent and 3 percent respectively 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  



 our performance for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  was favorably impacted by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 due to our 5253 week fiscal year calendar currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 14 billion  on net sales compared to the prior fiscal year the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was primarily a result of the addition of the covidien peripheral business into the aortic  peripheral vascular division and strong net sales across all three divisions cardiac rhythm  heart failure coronary  structural heart and aortic  peripheral vascular the surgical solutions and patient monitoring  recovery divisions within the minimally invasive therapies group contributed 53 billion  and 43 billion  of revenue respectively the restorative therapies group’s performance was a result of solid growth in surgical technologies and was favorably impacted by the addition of the covidien neurovascular division partially offset by declines in spine and neuromodulation the diabetes groups performance was primarily due to growth in international markets driven by the nextgeneration minimed 640g system with the enhanced enlite sensor see our discussion in the “net sales” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for more information on the results of our operating segments 

acquisition of covidien    in fiscal year 2015 we acquired covidien to continue in our mission to create a medical technology and services company with a comprehensive product portfolio and a broad global reach that is better able to improve healthcare outcomes covidien meaningfully accelerates our core strategies of therapy innovation globalization and economic value the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date 

for further information regarding the acquisition see the section entitled “acquisition and investments  acquisition of covidien” contained in “item 1 business” and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k the full text of the transaction agreement was filed as exhibit 21 to our amendment no 5 to the registration statement on form s4 filed with the sec on november 20 2014 

gaap to nongaap reconciliation the following is a reconciliation of our net sales operating profit income from operations before income taxes net income provision for income taxes and effective tax rate prepared in accordance with us gaap to those results after giving effect to adjustments relating to charges or gains that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact on net income in future periods we have provided these nongaap financial measures because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented management uses these nongaap financial measures to facilitate managements review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning management believes that the resulting nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the companys ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations these nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the companys operations investors should not consider results reflecting nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap and are cautioned that medtronic may calculate results reflecting nongaap financial measures in a manner that is different from other companies

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect managements best judgment about economic and market conditions and their potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources see also note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k which discusses our significant accounting policies 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

revenue recognition based upon the lag time between the original sale to distributors at list price and the related distributor rebate earned at time of sale to the end customer and the judgments involved in estimating such rebates we consider certain minimally invasive therapies group price adjustment rebates to be a critical accounting estimate we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant price adjustment rebates charged against gross sales for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 were 29 billion and 679 million respectively 

litigation contingencies    we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property disputes shareholder derivative actions securities class actions other class actions income tax matters and environmental matters the outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages as well as other relief including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation governmental proceedings and income tax matters involving the company are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k while it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the matters discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we believe it is possible that costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

income tax reserves    we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail these reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of us gaap under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iv there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value including projected future cash flows the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the third quarter at the reporting unit level and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired goodwill was 415 billion  and 405 billion  as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively 

we test definitelived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k definitelived intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 262 billion  and 274 billion  as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively 

the company assesses the impairment of indefinitelived intangibles annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired our impairment tests of indefinitelived intangibles require the company to make several estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows indefinitelived intangible assets were 721 million  and 720 million  as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively 

the results of our annual impairment test are discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

contingent consideration contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at estimated fair value and is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as income or expense within acquisitionrelated items  in our consolidated statements of income changes to the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates in the timing or probability of achieving the milestones which trigger payment or in discount rates the fair value of contingent consideration was 377 million  and 264 million  as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively 

net sales 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we amended the way in which we evaluate performance and allocate resources with the acquisition of covidien as a result we began to operate under four reportable segments and four operating segments the cardiac and vascular group composed of cardiac rhythm  heart failure coronary  structural heart and aortic  peripheral vascular businesses the minimally invasive therapies group composed of surgical solutions and patient monitoring  recovery the restorative therapies group composed of the spine neuromodulation surgical technologies and neurovascular businesses and the diabetes group see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion related to our segment reporting 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment and division for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  





cardiac and vascular group the cardiac and vascular group’s products with specific focus on comprehensive disease management include pacemakers insertable and external cardiac monitors cardiac resynchronization therapy devices crtd implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd leads and delivery systems ablation products electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents balloon and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products the cardiac and vascular group also includes care management services formerly known as cardiocom and cath lab managed services clms within the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division the cardiac and 

vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 102 billion  an increase of 9  percent compared to the prior fiscal year currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 572 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was favorably impacted by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the cardiac and vascular group’s performance for fiscal year 2016 also benefited from the addition of the covidien peripheral business into the aortic  peripheral vascular division and strong net sales across all three divisions see the more detailed discussion of each divisions performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 55 billion  an increase of 4 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales was driven by strong growth in af solutions with the continued global acceptance of our arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system additionally net sales were driven by the continued adoption of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor and the launch of the evera mri surescan icd in the us during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 with continued strong adoption through the fourth quarter fiscal year 2016 net sales for the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division were also affected by continued pricing pressures 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 31 billion  an increase of 2 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year nets sales were driven by the corevalve evolut r recapturable system in the us which was launched late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and a strong corevalve launch in japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 in addition net sales of coronary  structural heart division were driven by drugeluting stents including the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in europe and the resolute integrity drugeluting stent in the us and the recent launches of the nc euphora and sc euphora balloon dilatation catheters  net sales were partially offset by continued pricing pressures in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 16 billion  an increase of 52 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year the aortic  peripheral vascular division net sales performance benefited from the addition of the covidien peripheral business the increase in aortic  peripheral vascular net sales was driven by strong growth of the inpact admiral drugcoated balloon in the us and globally continued strength in valiant captiva taa stent graft sales continued solid adoption of our aptus helifx endoanchor and continued adoption of the endurant iis abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa 3piece system in the us net sales for the aortic  peripheral vascular division were affected by increased competition in international markets and reimbursement cuts in japan 

the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 94 billion  an increase of 6  percent compared to the prior fiscal year the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was primarily a result of strong net sales in cardiac rhythm  heart failure and aortic  peripheral vascular and solid growth in coronary  structural heart 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 52 billion  an increase of 5  percent compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales was driven by the ongoing acceptance of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor and the launches of the viva xt crtd with attain performa quadripolar crtd lead system in the us in september 2014 and evera mri surescan icd in japan in november 2014 net sales of the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division were also driven by the continued global acceptance of the arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system net sales from cardiocom and our clms business which includes the august 2014 acquisition of ngc medical spa ngc 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 30 billion  an increase of 3  percent compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in coronary  structural heart net sales was driven by ongoing success of the corevalve transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us the launch of the corevalve evolute r recapturable system in international markets and the international launch of the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in november 2014 net sales were partially offset by continued pricing pressures in the us western europe japan and india in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 11 billion  an increase of 20  percent compared to the prior fiscal year the aortic  peripheral vascular division includes a portion of the covidien peripheral business which contributed strong performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 on the strength of its chronic venous insufficiency products the increase in aortic  peripheral vascular net sales was driven by inpact admiral drugcoated balloons in the us and international markets aortic  peripheral vascular net sales were also driven by strong sales of our valiant captivia thoracic stent graft system and growth from the endurant 2s abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa stent graft system in the us and western europe net sales for the aortic  peripheral vascular division were impacted by increased competitive and pricing pressures in the us western europe and japan 

looking ahead we expect our cardiac and vascular group could be affected by the following 



2016 and launched in march 2016 the ampliacompiaclaria family of mri quad crtd surescan systems received ce mark approval in february 2016 the systems are approved for mri scans on any part of the body without positioning restrictions 



procedure we added new sizes and indications for resolute onyx in europe in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 



minimally invasive therapies group  minimally   invasive therapies group’s goals are to diagnose and intervene earlier improve treatments and help patients recover faster our technologies and products span the entire continuum of care the group looks to enhance patient outcomes through minimally invasive solutions with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract lungs pelvic region kidneys obesity and preventable complications the surgical solutions divisions products include those for advanced and general surgical care stapling vessel sealing and other surgical instruments sutures electrosurgery products hernia mechanical devices mesh implants and solutions for gastrointestinal gi advanced ablation and interventional lung the patient monitoring  recovery divisions products include ventilators capnography and other airway products sensors monitors compression and dialysis products enteral feeding wound care and medical surgical products including operating room supply products electrodes needles syringes and sharps disposals the minimally invasive therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2016 were  96 billion  currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 493 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the minimally invasive therapies group was favorably impacted by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the minimally invasive therapies group contains the majority of covidiens former operations see the more detailed discussion of each business’s performance below 

net sales contributions in surgical solutions for fiscal year 2016 were  53 billion  the net sales performance in surgical solutions was mainly attributable to stapling and energy stapling products results benefited from continued worldwide market adoption of the endo gia reinforced reload and energy products benefited from continued strong adoption of the ligasure maryland jaw and valleylab ft10 energy platform further early technologies product performance was driven by gastrointestinal solutions products more specifically our gastrointestinal diagnostic product line 

patient monitoring  recovery net sales for fiscal year 2016 were  43 billion  net sales contributions in patient monitoring  recovery were driven mainly by us sales within respiratory and patient monitoring patient care and safety and nursing care respiratory and patient monitoring performance was attributable to sensors airway products and acute ventilator sales patient care and safety net sales results were primarily due to sales of compression and sharpsafety product lines and sales within our electrode and dialysis products the nursing care results were largely driven by sales of incontinence enteral feeding and wound care products 

looking ahead we expect minimally invasive therapies group could be impacted by the following 







restorative therapies group  the restorative therapies group includes products for various areas of the spine bone graft substitutes biologic products trauma implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain movement disorders obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd overactive bladder urinary retention fecal incontinence and gastroparesis products to treat conditions of the ear nose and throat and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments additionally this group manufactures and sells imageguided surgery and intraoperative imaging systems with the addition of the neurovascular division through the january 2015 covidien acquisition the group manufactures and markets products and therapies to treat diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain and includes sales of coils neurovascular stents and flow diversion products the restorative therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 72 billion  an increase of 7 percent  over the prior fiscal year currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 244 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the restorative therapies groups performance was favorably impacted by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 the restorative therapies group’s performance for fiscal year 2016  was favorably impacted by the addition of the neurovascular division growth in surgical technologies and by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 partially offset by declines in neuromodulation and spine see the more detailed discussion of each businesss performance below 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 29 billion  a decrease of 2 percent  over the prior fiscal year the decrease in spine net sales was driven by declines in core spine and interventional partially offset by growth in bmp composed of infuse bone graft inductos in the eu in the us the us core spine market grew in the lowsingle digits with modest procedural growth offset by continued pricing pressures during fiscal year 2016 new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement in the core spine growth rate we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated olif procedures as well as from the recent solera voyager elevate and ptc interbody launches for tlif and midlf procedures in core spine we are also realizing some early benefits from our speed to scale initiative which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the market the interventional spine net sales decline was driven by continued pricing pressures in bmp strong growth in the us was offset by declines in international bmp due to the inductos stop shipment in europe which we expect to continue until the back half of fiscal year 2017 

neuromodulation net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 19 billion  a decrease of 3 percent  over the prior fiscal year the decrease in net sales was primarily due to challenges in drug pumps and pain stimulation partially offset by growth in gastrouro with relatively flat results in dbs in drug pumps the business was negatively affected by challenges related to its april 2015 us fda consent decree as well as the january divestiture of its intrathecal baclofen drug in pain stimulation and dbs declines were driven by increased competition in the market however drivers such as the expanded early onset dbs indication in the us that we received earlier this fiscal year and new strategies that focus our pain products on the growing opioid epidemic could improve future results in gastrouro implant growth of our interstim therapy for overactive bladder urinary retention and bowel incontinence continued in the us during fiscal year 2016 

surgical technologies net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 18 billion  an increase of 6 percent  over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was driven by continued worldwide net sales growth across the portfolio of advanced energy ent and neurosurgery performance was driven by strong growth of power systems aquamantys transcollation and peak plasmablade technologies as well as solid growth of midas rex products monitoring and oarm imaging systems 

neurovascular net sales for fiscal year 2016  were 587 million  the division contributed revenue from the strength of its coils stents flow diversion and access product lines our solitaire fr mechanical thrombectomy device delivered strong results solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms pipeline flex in the us and japan and pipeline shield in europe continue to lead the market 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 30 billion a decrease of 2 percent over the prior fiscal year the decrease in spines net sales for fiscal year 2015 was driven by declines in core spine and interventional partially offset by growth in bmp both the global and us core spine markets grew in the lowsingle digits with modest procedural growth offset by continued pricing pressures during fiscal year 2015 the core spine business continued to focus on differentiating itself over the longterm through portfolio updates procedural innovation and continued development and deployment of the its surgical synergy program that 

integrates imaging navigation and powered surgical instruments fiscal year 2015 included several new product launches including our prestige lp cervical disc and pure titanium coated ptc interbodies spacers which partially offset declines in core spine interventional spine net sales decline was driven by a decline in european sales where the business faced pricing pressures in germany and unfavorable currency translation underlying demand for bmp stabilized and returned to slight growth in the latter half of fiscal year 2015 

neuromodulation net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 20 billion an increase of 4 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was primarily due to strong growth in gastrouro and growth in dbs and pain stimulation our global focus on our neurologist referral programs and the strength of the earlystim data in international markets continues to drive solid growth of dbs systems implant growth of our interstim therapy for overactive bladder urinary retention and bowel incontinence continued in the us throughout fiscal year 2015 the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2015 was also due to global growth of our restoresensor surescan mri system while the us pain stimulation market has weakened as a result of reimbursement changes net sales of our surescan mri system for the fiscal year demonstrate our continued strength in the market 

surgical technologies net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 17 billion an increase of 7 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was driven by continued worldwide net sales growth across the portfolio of advanced energy ent and neurosurgery partially offset by unfavorable currency translation performance was driven by strong growth of power systems aquamantys transcollation and peak plasmablade technologies as well as solid growth of midas rex products monitoring and oarm imaging systems additionally net sales growth was positively impacted by launch of our nuvent sinus balloons in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisition of visualase during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 adding a mriguided laser ablation technology to our broad suite of neuroscience solutions for neurosurgery the increase in revenue from visualase and our nuvent sinus balloons was partially offset by our divestiture of the microfrance product line during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 

neurovascular net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 132 million the division formerly part of covidien contributed revenue from the strength of its coils stents flow diversion and access product lines the new england journal of medicine published several positive clinical trials on our solitaire fr revascularization device resulting in continued customer adoption of the product additionally net sales were positively impacted by the us launch of the pipeline flex embolization device which was launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 

looking ahead we expect our restorative therapies group could be affected by the following 



pc our small and advanced primary cell battery and activa rc a rechargeable dbs device we anticipate continued competitive pressures in europe and expect competition to enter the us market in the coming year 



diabetes group    the diabetes group is composed of the intensive insulin management iim nonintensive diabetes therapies ndt and diabetes service  solutions dss divisions the diabetes group products include insulin pumps continuous glucose monitoring cgm systems insulin pump consumables and therapy management software the diabetes group’s net sales for fiscal year 2016 were 19 billion  an increase of 6  percent over the prior fiscal year and were favorably affected by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 net sales in the us increased 6 percent compared to the prior fiscal year driven by the minimed 530g system with enlite sensor in the iim division currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 101 million as a result of the change in exchange rates from the prior year the diabetes groups performance in international markets was favorably affected by our nextgeneration minimed 640g system with the enhanced enlite sensor 

the diabetes group’s net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 18 billion  an increase of 6 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was primarily driven by 9 percent growth in the us driven by the ongoing launch of the minimed 530g system with enlite sensor approval was obtained late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 net sales in the international markets increased 2 percent compared to the prior fiscal year performance in international markets was favorably affected by the launch of our nextgeneration minimed 640g system with the enhanced enlite cgm sensor in australia and europe partially offset by unfavorable currency translation 

looking ahead we expect our diabetes group could be impacted by the following 



america countries and the minimed 620g the first integrated system customized for the japanese market the company continues to make progress in bringing the minimed 640g to the us and plans to submit the premarket approval to the us fda in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 in addition the company is on track to file its premarket approval to the us fda for the first hybrid closed loop system by the end of june 2016 

 

operations by market geography 

the graph below illustrates net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  

the table below illustrates net sales by market geography for each of our operating segments for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  



for fiscal year 2016  net sales for the us increased 45 percent developed markets outside the us increased 37 percent and emerging markets increased 43 percent compared to the prior fiscal year currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 14 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2016  net sales growth in the us was led by strong growth in the cardiac and vascular group and solid growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes the growth in all markets was primarily driven by the addition of minimally invasive therapies group net sales totaling  96 billion  for fiscal year 2016 and was also favorably impacted by an additional selling week during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 

for fiscal year 2015  net sales for the us increased 22 percent nonus developed markets increased 13 percent and emerging markets increased 23 percent over the prior fiscal year currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 666 million on net sales for fiscal year 2015  net sales growth in nonus developed markets was driven by the addition of the minimally invasive therapies group in the fourth quarter as a result of the covidien acquisition offset by unfavorable currency translation emerging markets growth was led by strong growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes solid growth in the cardiac and vascular group and the addition of the minimally invasive therapies group in the fourth quarter as a result of the covidien acquisition partially offset by unfavorable currency translation 

net sales outside the us are accompanied by certain financial risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and collection of receivables which typically have longer payment terms we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business however a significant amount of our outstanding accounts receivable are with international customers we continue to monitor the economic conditions in many countries outside the us and the average length of time it takes to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries although we do not currently foresee a significant credit risk associated with a material portion of these receivables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries 

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percent of net sales 



cost of products sold  we continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through channel optimization supply chain management and review of our manufacturing network beginning in fiscal year 2015 our product mix has substantially changed with the acquisition of covidien in fiscal year 2015 the patient monitoring  recovery division within minimally invasive therapies group which accounts for approximately 45 percent of minimally invasive therapies groups net sales generally realizes a lower average margin due to the type products sold within the division therefore cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales has increased in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 cost of products sold was 91 billion  63 billion  and 43 billion  in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

we have recognized amortization of the adjustment related to inventory fair value from the covidien acquisition to cost of products sold totaling 226 million and 623 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively additionally in fiscal year 2015 cost of products sold included a 74 million charge related to a crhf global comprehensive program for home based monitors due to industry conversion from analog to digital technology restructuring charges included in cost of products sold totaled 9 million 15 million and 10 million in fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively for inventory writeoffs of discontinued product lines these charges affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further analysis related to these charges 

research and development    we remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs lead to enhanced quality of life and can be validated by clinical and economic evidence we are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare during fiscal year 2016 we continued to invest in new technologies to support our mission with several new acquisitions as well as continued product growth within our business units 

research and development expense for fiscal year 2016  2015  and 2014  was 22 billion  16 billion  and 15 billion  respectively research and development expense remained fairly flat as a percentage of net sales over the threeyear period 

selling general and administrative  our goal is to continue selling general and administrative expense leverage initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from the acquisition of covidien during fiscal year 2016 we realized a 13 percentage point decrease in our selling general and administrative expense percentage to net sales as a result of these initiatives 

selling general and administrative expense was 95 billion  69 billion  and 58 billion  during fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the following is a summary of other costs and expenses 



special charges gains net    during fiscal year 2016  we recognized special charges of 70 million  in connection with the impairment of a debt investment 

during fiscal year 2015 we recognized special gains of 138 million  which consisted of a 41 million  gain on the sale of a product line in the surgical technologies division and a 97 million  gain on the sale of an equity method investment  

during fiscal year 2015 and 2014 consistent with our commitment to improving the health of people and communities throughout the world we made charitable contributions of 100 million  and 40 million  respectively to the medtronic foundation which is a related party nonprofit organization 

special charges gains net will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods and we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further analysis related to these charges 

restructuring charges net    we incur restructuring charges in connection with our costreduction and productivity initiatives or with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations amounts recognized as restructuring charges result from a series of judgments and estimates about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on assumptions upon implementation of the initiative programs restructuring programs will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods and we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis 

we began our restructuring program related to the acquisition of covidien the cost synergies initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we anticipate approximately 850 million in cost synergies to be achieved as a result of the covidien acquisition through fiscal year 2018 including administrative office optimization manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure and certain general and administrative savings restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in future fiscal years as cost synergy initiatives are finalized restructuring charges are expected to be primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturing and facility closures 

currently we have   several initiative programs in various states of progress with total restructuring liabilities of 257 million  and 233 million  at april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively during fiscal year 2016 we incurred 332 million  in restructuring charges 9 million  of which was related to inventory writeoffs of discontinued product lines recognized within cost of products sold  in the consolidated statements of income these charges were partially offset by a 33 million  reversal of excess restructuring reserves 

for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

certain litigation charges net    we classify material litigation charges and gains recognized as certain litigation charges net certain litigation charges net will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods and we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 we recorded certain litigation charges net of 26 million  and 42 million  respectively which primarily relate to additional accounting charges for probable and reasonably estimable infuse product liability litigation which were recorded as a result of additional filed and unfiled claims and other litigation matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

during fiscal year 2014 we recorded certain litigation charges net of 770 million  which primarily included the global patent settlement agreement with edwards lifesciences corporation of 589 million  and accounting charges for probable and reasonably estimable infuse product liability litigation of 140 million  

acquisitionrelated items during fiscal year 2016  we recorded charges from acquisitionrelated items of 283 million  primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the covidien acquisition the charges incurred in connection with the covidien acquisition include 219 million  of professional services and integration costs and 58 million  of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense 

during fiscal year 2015 we recorded charges from acquisitionrelated items of 550 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the covidien acquisition the charges incurred in connection with the covidien acquisition include 275 million of professional services and integration costs 189 million of accelerated or incremental stock compensation expense and 69 million of incremental officer and director excise tax 

during fiscal year 2014 we recorded net charges from acquisitionrelated items of  117 million  primarily including iprd and longlived asset impairment charges of  236 million  related to the ardian inc acquisition recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 the impairment charges were partially offset by income of  138 million  related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration associated with acquisitions subsequent to april 29 2009 

acquisitionrelated items will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods and we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on iprd charges 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definitelived intangible assets consisting of purchased patents trademarks tradenames purchased technology and other intangible assets amortization of intangible assets will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider this a nongaap adjustment refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further details related to this expense 

in fiscal year 2016  amortization expense was 19 billion  as compared to 733 million  in fiscal year 2015  the 12 billion increase in amortization expense in fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to realizing a full year impact of amortization of intangibles acquired with covidien in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 

in fiscal year 2015  amortization expense was 733 million  an increase of 384 million from 349 million  in fiscal year 2014  the increase was primarily due to the fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 acquisition of covidien which added 379 million in amortization expense and fiscal year 2014 acquisitions of tyrx corventis inc and visualase inc partially offset by reduced ongoing amortization expense from certain intangible assets that became fully amortized 

other expense net    other expense net includes royalty income and expense realized equity security gains and losses realized currency transaction and derivative gains and losses impairment charges on equity securities the puerto rico excise tax and the us medical device excise tax in fiscal year 2016  other expense net was  107 million  a decrease of 11 million from  118 million  in the prior fiscal year the largest contributor to the change in other expense net was an increase in net realized currency gains which were partially offset by increased royalty expense within minimally invasive therapies group and a writeoff of a minority investment in the current year total net realized currency gains recorded in other expense net  were 314 million in fiscal year 2016  compared to gains of 196 million in the prior fiscal year looking ahead we expect other expense net will be impacted as a result of the suspension of the us medical device excise tax for two years beginning january 1 2016 and ending december 31 2017 

in fiscal year 2015  other expense net was  118 million  a decrease of 63 million from  181 million  in the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to an increase in net realized currency gains partially offset by increased royalties in our structural heart business and increased us medical device excise tax which for fiscal year 2015 was 135 million compared to 112 million in the prior fiscal year total net realized currency gains recorded in other expense net  were 196 million in fiscal year 2016  compared to gains of 43 million in the prior fiscal year 

interest expense net    interest expense net includes interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on trading securities ineffectiveness on interest rate derivative instruments and the net realized gain or loss on the sale or impairment of availableforsale debt securities in fiscal year 2016  interest expense net was 955 million  as compared to 280 million  in fiscal year 2015  the increase in interest expense net for fiscal year 2016 was largely driven by an increase in total shortterm and longterm borrowings primarily resulting from the covidien acquisition and a 183 million  charge recorded 

in connection with the cash tender offer and redemption of certain outstanding debt securities as discussed within the “liquidity and capital resources section of this management’s discussion and analysis in addition during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 we incurred a 45 million  loss on interest rate swaps which were previously entered into in advance of a planned debt issuance that is no longer expected after the internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy covidien businesses completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 the company treats this interest expense charge as well as the 183 million  charge associated with the cash tender offer and redemption as nongaap adjustments the increase in interest expense net during fiscal year 2016  was partially offset by increased interest income earned on higher investment balances as compared to fiscal year 2015  based on current expected rates we expect interest expense net to increase in future quarters as our investment balances decline resulting from the deployment of capital including incremental share repurchases and net debt reduction 

in fiscal year 2015  interest expense net was  280 million  as compared to  108 million  in fiscal year 2014 for fiscal year 2015  the increase in interest expense net was primarily due to the impact of the incremental interest expense resulting from the issuance of 170 billion of debt to fund the covidien acquisition and the 30 billion term loan funded in january 2015 the 170 billion debt resulted in 77 million of incremental interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 prior to the close of the covidien transaction the company treated this interest expense item as a nongaap adjustment 

see our discussion in the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for more information regarding our investment portfolio 

income taxes 



our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 184 percent compared to 233 percent in the prior fiscal year the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to the net tax impact of inventory stepup debt tender premium acquisitionrelated items certain tax adjustments amortization of intangible assets the impact from the acquisition of covidien operational tax benefits described below and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 158 percent compared to 182 percent in the prior fiscal year the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the covidien acquisition operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2016 we recorded 97 million in operational tax benefits the retroactive renewal and extension of the us federal research and development tax credit resulted in a 16 million operational tax benefit for fiscal year 2016 in addition we recorded a 40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses and a 41 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 233 percent compared to 173 percent from the prior fiscal year the increase in our effective tax rate was due to the net tax impact of special charges gains net restructuring charges net certain litigation charges net acquisitionrelated items certain tax adjustments the impact from the acquisition of covidien the operational tax benefits described below 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 182 percent compared to 192 percent in the prior fiscal year the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the covidien acquisition operational tax benefits described below and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2015 we recorded 33 million in operational tax benefits the retroactive renewal and extension of the us federal research and development tax credit resulted in a 12 million operational tax benefit for fiscal year 2015 in addition we recorded a 9 million benefit associated with foreign dividend distributions and a 12 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves 

an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal years ended april 29 2016 and april 24 2015 of approximately 74 million and 58 million respectively 

certain tax adjustments      

during fiscal year 2016 we recorded certain tax adjustments of 417 million a 442 million certain tax adjustment charge was recorded which primarily related to the us income tax expense resulting from our completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by our uscontrolled nonus subsidiaries the internal reorganization as a result of the internal reorganization approximately 97 billion of cash cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities previously held by uscontrolled nonus subsidiaries became available for general corporate purposes this charge was partially offset by a 25 million tax benefit associated with the disposition of a wholly owned us subsidiary the 417 million net certain tax adjustment was recorded in the provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2016 

in fiscal year 2015 we recorded certain tax adjustments of 349 million of which 329 million related to the resolution of the kyphon inc kyphon acquisitionrelated issues with the us internal revenue service irs in addition the certain tax adjustments include 20 million related to a taxable gain associated with the covidien acquisition the 349 million certain tax adjustment was recorded in the provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2015 

in fiscal year 2014 we recorded a 63 million certain tax benefit associated with the resolution of certain issues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 with the irs relating to their review of our fiscal year 2009 through 2011 domestic income tax returns the 63 million certain tax benefit was recorded in the provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 2014 

certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods therefore we consider these nongaap adjustments refer to the executive level overview section of this managements discussion and analysis for further analysis related to these adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 



 as of april 29 2016  we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility in the future approximately 5 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and investments held by certain uscontrolled nonus subsidiaries may not represent available liquidity for general corporate purposes however we believe our other existing cash cash equivalents and investments as well as our 35 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program no commercial paper outstanding as of april 29 2016  will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements 

our net cash position in fiscal year 2016  decreased by 19 billion  as compared to fiscal year 2015  see the “summary of cash flows” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

in april 2016 the company completed a cash tender offer and redemption of 27 billion  of senior notes for 30 billion  of total consideration we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 163 million  which included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums the loss on debt extinguishment was recorded in the interest expense in the consolidated statement of income in addition to the loss on debt extinguishment we recognized 20 million  of interest expense due to the acceleration of net losses on forward starting interest rate derivatives which had been terminated at the time of original debt issuances relating to the portion of debt extinguished in the tender offer

standard  poors sp ratings services and moodys investors service longterm debt rating and shortterm debt rating at april 29 2016  were unchanged as compared to the ratings at april 24 2015  we do not expect the moodys and sp ratings services ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet our 35 billion revolving credit facility and related commercial paper program discussed above and within the “debt and capital” section of this managements discussion and analysis 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k provide information regarding amounts we have accrued related to significant legal proceedings in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows 

we provide for tax liabilities in our financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate funds that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs however we evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include us government and agency securities corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities debt funds and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss 

for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recorded all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost however as of april 29 2016  we have 327 million  of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate shortterm and longterm availableforsale debt securities of 97 billion  if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary impairment in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results management is required to use estimates and assumptions in its valuation of our investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual 

results could differ materially from those estimates see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding fair value measurements 

summary of cash flows 



operating activities    our net cash provided by operating activities was 52 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  compared to 49 billion  provided in the prior year the 316 million increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization loss on debt extinguishment and acquisitionrelated items of 21 billion and a decrease in certain litigation payments of 469 million partially offset by an increase in cash paid for incomes taxes and interest of 747 million and 688 million respectively the increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of the settlement payments made for the resolution of the kyphon acquisitionrelated matters internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy covidien businesses and the impacts from the full year of covidien results the increase in cash paid for interest was primarily the result of a full year of interest payments on the senior notes and term loan issued in fiscal year 2015 primarily to fund the 16 billion cash consideration portion of the covidien acquisition as well as the interest payments on the outstanding debt assumed as part of the covidien acquisition net cash provided by operating activities was further offset by the impact of a full year of operations postcovidien acquisition 

our net cash provided by operating activities was 49 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  compared to 50 billion  provided in the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  the slight yearoveryear decrease is primarily the result of certain covidien acquisition impacts including acquisitionrelated items accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes offset by the 750 million settlement payment made to edwards in may 2014 

investing activities    our net cash provided by investing activities was 22 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  compared to 171 billion  used in the prior year the 193 billion increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of cash used in the prior year for acquisitions primarily related to the covidien acquisition as well as an increase in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of marketable securities in the current fiscal year 

our net cash used in investing activities was 171 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  compared to 36 billion  used in the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  the 135 billion increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of cash used in fiscal year ended april 24 2015  for acquisitions primarily related to the covidien acquisition partially offset by a decrease in net purchases and sales and maturities of marketable securities 

financing activities     our net cash used in financing activities was 95 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 29 2016  compared to 159 billion  provided in the prior year the 255 billion decrease primarily resulted from a net decrease in debt issued primarily related to the covidien acquisition higher payments of maturing and extinguished longterm debt an increase in cash paid for dividends to shareholders and an increase in repurchases of ordinary shares 

our net cash provided by financing activities was 159 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  compared to 918 million  used in the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  the 169 billion increase primarily resulted from a net increase in issuances of longterm debt primarily related to the covidien acquisition net of payments on longterm debt and shortterm borrowings partially offset by a decrease in net issuance and repurchases of ordinary shares 

free cash flow 

free cash flow a nongaap financial measure is calculated by subtracting property plant and equipment additions from operating cash flows management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt interestbearing debt as a percentage of total interestbearing debt and equity was 38 percent  as of april 29 2016  and 40 percent  as of april 24 2015  

as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders shares are repurchased from time to time in january 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the adoption of the existing medtronic inc share redemption program during fiscal years 2016  and 2015  we repurchased a total of 38 million  and 30 million  shares at an average price of 7492  and 6453  respectively in june 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the redemption of an additional 80 million  of the companys ordinary shares as of april 29 2016  we have approximately 72 million  shares remaining under the current board authorization 

we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs shortterm debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations as of april 29 2016  was 993 million  compared to 24 billion  as of april 24 2015  

we maintain a commercial paper program for short term financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 35 billion no amounts were outstanding under this program as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  respectively 

during fiscal years 2016  and 2015  the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 49 and 52 days respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 057 percent  and 013 percent  respectively the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 35 billion syndicated line of credit facility 35 billion revolving credit facility which expires in january 2020 the 35 billion revolving credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes the 35 billion revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional 500 million at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the 35 billion revolving credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date the company could also request a one year extension of the maturity date as of april 29 2016  and april 24 2015  no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit 

interest rates on advances on our 35 billion revolving credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp ratings services and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp 

ratings services and moodys refer to liquidity and capital resources section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with as of april 29 2016  

we utilize senior notes that are unsecured senior obligations that rank equally with all other secured and unsubordinated indebtedness to meet our longterm financing needs we use the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes and in the case of senior notes issued on december 10 2014 to finance the covidien acquisition and related expenses longterm debt as of april 29 2016  was 302 billion  compared to 338 billion  as of april 24 2015  the decrease is primarily due to the cash tender offer and redemption of 27 billion of senior notes for 30 billion of total consideration in april 2016 as discussed within the “liquidity and capital resources section of this management’s discussion and analysis the indentures under which the senior notes have been issued contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with as of april 29 2016  

on december 10 2014 we issued seven tranches of the 2015 senior notes with an aggregate face value of 170 billion in addition on january 26 2015 we also borrowed 30 billion for a term of three years under a term loan agreement we used these combined proceeds to fund the 160 billion cash consideration portion of the covidien acquisition to pay certain transaction and financing expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes

milestone payments we acquire assets still in development enter into research and development arrangements and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone andor royalty payments to a thirdparty contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events milestone payments may be required upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of a product or upon certain predesignated levels of achievement in clinical trials in addition if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based on a percentage of sales related to the product under development or in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment we have included those milestone or minimum royalty payments in the preceding table however the majority of these arrangements give us the discretion to unilaterally make the decision to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments although we are unlikely to cease development if a device successfully achieves clinical testing objectives these payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations because of the contingent nature of these payments and our ability to avoid them if we decided to pursue a different path of development or testing see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration 

indemnification provisions in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our commitments table historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations

we undertake no obligation to update any statement we make but investors are advised to consult all other disclosures by us in our filings with the securities and exchange commission especially on forms 10k 10q and 8k in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results in addition actual results may differ materially from those anticipated due to a number of factors including among others those discussed in the section entitled “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors as such investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

currency exchange rate risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes in a period where the us dollar is strengtheningweakening as compared to other currencies our revenues and expenses denominated in other currencies are translated into us dollars at a lowerhigher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment 

we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of the derivative instruments are the euro and japanese yen fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 29 2016  and april 24 2015 was 108 billion  and 98 billion respectively at april 29 2016  these contracts were in an unrealized loss position of 11 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 29 2016  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies the fair value of these contracts would increasedecrease by approximately 725 million any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our shortterm investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio as of april 29 2016  was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars of which approximately 90 is fixed rate debt and approximately 10 is floatingrate debt we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates compared to interest rates as of april 29 2016  indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 85 million

other factors impacting our operations 

research and development 

the markets in which we participate can be subject to rapid technological advances constant improvement of products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership our research and development rd efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future we have not engaged in significant customer or governmentsponsored research 

during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  we spent 1640 billion   81  percent of net sales 1477 billion   87  percent of net sales and 1557 billion   94  percent of net sales on rd respectively the covidien acquisition contributed to the decline in rd as a percent of net sales during fiscal year 2015 our rd activities include improving existing products and therapies expanding their indications and applications for use and developing new products we continue to focus on optimizing innovation improving our rd productivity driving growth in emerging markets clinical evidence generation and assessing our rd programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers 

acquisitions and investments 

our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients health and extend lives requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop an allencompassing portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our rd efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon acquisitions investments and alliances to provide access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas and markets 

we expect to make future investments or acquisitions where we believe that we can stimulate the development of or acquire new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

for additional information see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k and item 1a risk factors  failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business

patents and licenses 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks tradenames copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology we have filed and obtained numerous patents in the us and abroad and regularly file patent applications worldwide in our continuing effort to establish and protect our proprietary technology 

us patents typically have a 20year term from the application date while patent protection outside the us varies from country to country in addition we have entered into exclusive and nonexclusive licenses relating to a wide array of thirdparty technologies we have also obtained certain trademarks and tradenames for our products to distinguish our genuine products from our competitors’ products and we maintain certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business as a whole our efforts to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights have included ongoing review of thirdparty patents and patent applications for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

markets and distribution methods 

we sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the us for certain portions of our business acquired through the covidien acquisition we also sell through distributors in the us our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals surgicenters and alternate care facilities such as home care and longterm care facilities and are marketed to materials managers gpos and integrated delivery networks idns primarily through thirdparty distributors although we also have direct sales representatives we often negotiate with gpos and idns which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities our three largest markets are the us western europe and japan emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity as we believe they remain underpenetrated 

our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid costeffective delivery of highquality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide  including physicians hospitals other medical institutions and gpos to achieve this objective we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties this focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to crosssell complementary products we believe that we maintain excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry that enable us to gain a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments trends and emerging opportunities and respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and patients we attempt to enhance our presence in the medical community through active participation in medical meetings and by conducting comprehensive training and educational activities we believe that these activities contribute to physician expertise 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among hospitals and other customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power this enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendors our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve we are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales 

competition and industry 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries our product lines face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products in addition we face competition from providers of other medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry in addition in the current environment of managed care economically motivated customers consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner maintain highquality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products 

worldwide operations 

our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country often with longerterm receivables than are typical in the us foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect revenues net of expenses and cash flows from operations outside the us we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flow see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k in addition the repatriation of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the us may result in substantial us tax cost 

for financial reporting purposes net sales and property plant and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

production and availability of raw materials 

we manufacture most of our products at 80 manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world the largest of these manufacturing facilities are located in ireland the us in thirteen states puerto rico canada costa rica dominican republic france germany israel italy japan mexico the peoples republic of china singapore and switzerland we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability due to the us fda’s requirements regarding manufacturing of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials generally we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our operations we have reporting and disclosure requirements related to the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries pursuant to these requirements we are required to report on form sd the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2014 calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

working capital practices 

our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers 

employees 

on april 24 2015  we employed more than 92000 employees including fulltime equivalent employees our employees are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment 

seasonality 

worldwide sales including us sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedures incorporating medtronic products is generally lower during summer months due to summer vacation schedules in the northern hemisphere particularly in european countries in addition pulse oximetry sales can be impacted by flu season 

government regulation and other considerations 

our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda and similar agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products our business is also affected by us and foreign 

patient privacy laws cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations the primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below 

the laws applicable to us are subject to change and are subject to evolving interpretations if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations medtronic and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial fines and damages and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 

product approval processes 

authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device or technology in the us is generally received in one of two ways the first known as premarket notification or the 510k process requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device or technology in this process we must submit data that supports our equivalence claim if human clinical data is required it must be gathered in compliance with us fda investigational device exemption regulations we must receive an order from the us fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we can commercially distribute the new medical device or technology modifications to cleared medical devices or technologies can be made without using the 510k process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness covidien products are generally subject to the premarket notification process a very small number of our devices are exempt from premarket review 

the second more rigorous process known as premarket approval pma requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective we do this by collecting data regarding design materials bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device the us fda will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective this determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device this process is much more detailed timeconsuming and expensive than the 510k process a third seldom used process for approval exists for humanitarian use devices intended for patient populations of less than 4000 patients per year in the us this exemption is similar to the pma process however a full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trials is not required the threshold for approving these products is probable benefit and safety 

many countries outside the us to which we export medical devices also subject such medical devices and technologies to their own regulatory requirements frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device or technology and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing we cannot assure you that laws and regulations may not be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute products 

in the european union eu a single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the ce mark to obtain a ce mark defined products must meet minimum standards of performance safety and quality ie the essential requirements and then according to their classification comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes a notified body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the medical device directive medtronic is subject to inspection by notified bodies for compliance the competent authorities of the eu countries generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner various penalties exist for noncompliance with the laws transcribing the medical device directives 

to be sold in japan most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval or “shonin” the japanese government through the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical devices under the pharmaceutical affairs law pal oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda a quasigovernment organization performing many of the review functions for mhlw penalties for a company’s noncompliance with pal could be severe including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions mhlw and pmda also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the pal medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies 

our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for 

medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future there can be no assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or costeffective manner or approved at all 

ongoing us fda regulations 

both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations the us fda reviews design and manufacturing practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices we are also subject to periodic inspection by the us fda for compliance with the us fda’s quality system regulations which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use in addition the us fda and other us regulatory bodies including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the department of justice doj and various state attorneys general monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products although surgeons are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the us fda we are prohibited from promoting products for such “offlabel” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or ban such medical devices the us fda may also impose operating restrictions enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices including a hold on approving new devices until issues are resolved to its satisfaction and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers employees or us the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by thirdparty payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct 

in april 2015 we entered into a consent decree with the fda relating to our neuromodulation business’ synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires the company to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree limits the companys ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system unless specific conditions are met the agreement does not require the retrieval of any of the company’s products but the company must retain a thirdparty expert to inspect the neuromodulation quality system and to provide a certification that the system complies with the requirements of the consent decree once this certification is provided to the fdas satisfaction the limitations on manufacturer and distribution of synchromed pumps will be lifted thereafter the company must submit periodic audit reports to the fda to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree 

governmental trade regulations 

the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations a variety of laws and regulations both in the us and in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of goods services and technology across international borders because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs penalties or liabilities these laws and regulations govern among other things our import and export activities 

the us fda in cooperation with us customs and border protection cbp administers controls over the import of medical devices into the us the cbp imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance medtronic is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by several us government agencies including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign assets control within the treasury department we import raw materials components and finished products into the countries in which we transact business we act as the import of record in many instances but we also sell and ship goods to third parties who are themselves responsible for complying with applicable trade laws and regulations in our role as importer of record we are directly responsible for complying with customs laws and regulations concerning the importation of our raw materials components and finished products if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or such third parties were not in compliance with applicable us fda or customs laws and regulations when engaging in crossborder transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability depending on the nature of the violation and 

the extent of our culpability in addition such determinations may cause supply chain disruptions and delays in the distribution of our products that impact our business activities 

many countries including the us control the export and reexport of goods technology and services for reasons including public health national security regional stability antiterrorism policies and other reasons in certain circumstances approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods technology or services are exported or reexported to certain destinations to certain endusers and for certain enduses in addition international sales of our medical devices that have not received us fda approval are subject to us fda export requirements some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons or entities in addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities we also sell and provide goods technology and services to agents representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and endusers if applicable government agencies were to determine that we or the third parties through which we export goods were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability similarly such determinations may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products or result in restrictions being placed upon our international distribution and sales of products which may materially impact our business activities 

antiboycott laws 

under us laws and regulations us companies and their controlledinfact foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of goods or services within the us or between the us and a foreign country currently the us considers the arab league boycott of israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott we are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirements of us antiboycott laws for all transactions in which we are involved if we or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services are determined to have violated us antiboycott laws and regulations we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability penalties for any violations of antiboycott laws and regulations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines imprisonment debarment from government contracts loss of export privileges and the denial of certain tax benefits including foreign tax credits and foreign subsidiary deferrals

us federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers in particular in april 2003 the us department of health and human services hhs published patient privacy rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and in april 2005 published security rules for protected health information the hipaa privacy and security rules govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by “covered entities” which are health care providers that submit electronic claims health plans and health care clearinghouses in 2009 congress passed the hitech act which modified certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rules for covered entities and their business associates which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity’s workforce these included directing hhs to publish more specific security standards and increasing breach notification requirements as well as tightening certain aspects of the privacy rules hhs published the final versions of these new rules in january 2013 and covered entities and business associates were expected to be in compliance by september 2013 in addition the hitech act provided that business associates will now be subject to the same security requirements as covered entities and that with regard to both the security and privacy rule business associates will be subject to direct enforcement by hhs including civil and criminal liability just as covered entities are in the past hipaa has generally affected us indirectly medtronic is generally not a covered entity except for a few units such as our diabetes business medtronic monitoring inc and our health insurance plans medtronic only operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances in those cases the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information we are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patients’ health information and believe that we meet the expectations of the hipaa rules some modifications to our systems and policies may be necessary but the framework is already in place however the potential for enforcement action against us is now greater as hhs can take action directly against business associates thus while we believe we are and will be in substantial compliance with hipaa standards there is no guarantee that the government will agree enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business we believe the ongoing costs and impacts of assuring compliance with the hipaa privacy and security rules are not material to our business in addition there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies while medtronic has not been named in any such suits if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur we could become a target of such litigation 

we are also impacted by the privacy requirements of countries outside the united states privacy standards in europe and asia are becoming increasingly strict enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the eu are growing and new 

laws and restrictions are being passed the management of cross border transfers of information among and outside of eu member countries is becoming more complex which may complicate our clinical research activities as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data china and russia have passed socalled “data localization” laws which require multinational companies that store certain individually identifiable data on their citizens to maintain that data on servers located in their country restrictions on transfer or processing of that data may apply as well these laws are new and the chinese and russian governments have not yet issued guidance on how they will apply or enforce them the restrictions may complicate our operations in those countries adding complexity and additional management and oversight needs we will continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to applicable laws 

cost containment initiatives 

government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanics coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical devices and therapies government programs including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments tying reimbursement to outcomes shifting to population health management and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs hospitals which purchase implants are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms including for example creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limiting the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements such as gainsharing where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products 

some thirdparty payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private thirdparty payers in addition some private thirdparty payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement international examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms in markets significant to medtronics business include japan where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures as a result of our manufacturing efficiencies cost controls and other costsavings initiatives we believe we are wellpositioned to respond to changes resulting from the worldwide trend toward costcontainment however uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation new or changed coverage and reimbursement government or private payor policies or decisions or other reforms making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of costcontainment trends on future operating results 

regulations governing reimbursement 

the delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services us laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services 

us federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federallyfunded health care programs the principal us federal laws include 1 the antikickback statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing ordering recommending making referrals to items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program 2 the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federallyfunded health care program including claims resulting from a violation of the antikickback statute 3 the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider and 4 health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payer there are often similar state false claims antikickback and antiselfreferral and insurance laws that apply to statefunded medicaid and other health care programs and private thirdparty payers insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa can be used to prosecute companies in the us for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the us if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in us and foreign legislative regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the us and abroad or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

environmental health and safety laws 

we are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other companies in our industry our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials to the best of our knowledge at this time we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

litigation risks 

patent litigation  we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products at any given time we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

product liability and other claims    we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims these claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class we are also susceptible to other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation these claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation we believe the outcomes associated with this type of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows for additional information see “item 1a risk factors  quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes goods and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows  ” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

selfinsurance 

with the exception of insurance that covidien currently holds for certain risks we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks we made this decision based on conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of selfinsurance retentions increasing numbers of coverage limitations and dramatically higher insurance premium rates we maintain a directors and officers insurance policy providing limited coverage and we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future based on historical loss trends we believe that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses historical trends however may not be indicative of future losses the absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

section 13r of the exchange act 

under section 13r of the exchange act the company is required to include certain disclosures in its periodic reports if the company or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report as part of its ongoing compliance program the company identified certain sales of medical devices made during fiscal year 2015 by one of its nonus affiliated entities to parties in iran that were not covered by a general license issued by the us treasury departments office of foreign assets controls ofac those sales which were generally conducted through distributors whose customers include public hospitals which may be owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the iranian government resulted in approximately 4 million in gross revenues and approximately 3 million in net profits excluding selling general and administrative expenses and allocations in fiscal year 2015 at the time of these sales the company believed based on correspondence received from ofac in response to a request to renew the specific licenses the company had to cover these sales that the sales were eligible for an ofac general license the company subsequently obtained the specific licenses required for these continued sales the company has also submitted an initial notification of voluntary selfdisclosure regarding this matter to ofac

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in us involves a variety of risks and uncertainties known and unknown including among others those discussed below each of the following risks should be carefully considered based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company however the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones related to our businesses and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to the company 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively 

we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in approximately 160 countries throughout the world these markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries in the product lines in which we compete we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products development by other companies of new or improved products processes technologies or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our products or proposed products less competitive in addition we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies competitive factors include 

 we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these 

companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies 

major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems physician advisories safety alerts and publications about our products reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality systems in our industry in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary products obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our products given these factors we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry 

reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements we manufacture most of our products at numerous manufacturing facilities located throughout the world we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components however for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability however we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in addition due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the us fda regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and to make our related product sales 

other problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues 

in addition several of our key products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost 

moreover pursuant to the conflict minerals requirements promulgated by the sec as a part of doddfrank we are required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials we will incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to evaluate the source of any conflict minerals in our products and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of our raw materials 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater regulation in the future 

our medical devices and technologies and our business activities are subject to a complex regime of regulations and an aggressive enforcement environment including by the us fda doj health and human servicesoffice of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities and members of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after august 1 2013 to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our business we anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to costly and complex us and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous us and foreign government agencies including the us fda and comparable agencies outside the us to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations 

governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions and cash flows even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance it may 

 both before and after a product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibilities under us fda regulations many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the us fda to determine compliance with the us fda’s requirements including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations the results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on us fda’s form483 warning letters or other forms of enforcement since 2009 the us fda has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations including medical device companies by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities the us fda has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations 

in addition device manufacturers are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling a number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “offlabel” uses including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for “offlabel” uses constitute false and fraudulent claims to the government the failure to comply with “offlabel” promotion restrictions can result in significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligations and costs andor other potential penalties from andor agreements with the federal government 

pursuant to doddfrank the sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten or their ores and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries under the rules we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as of the date of each of medtronic inc’s and covidiens conflict minerals report for the 2014 calendar year each of medtronic inc and covidien were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of its respective suppliers and was unable to determine that all of its respective products are conflict free in addition we may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement 

foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future penalties for a company’s noncompliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities violations and litigation 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites chemical constituents 

in medical equipment and endoflife disposal and takeback programs and the health and safety of our employees our operations involve the use of substances regulated under such laws and regulations primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes if we violate these environmental laws and regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators furthermore environmental laws outside of the us are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

in addition certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 

we may in the future be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our medtronic inc and covidien’s past present or future business activities the costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flow 

our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

our devices products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payors such as governmental programs eg medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs private insurance plans and managed care plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from thirdparty payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay as a result our devices products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms as well as comparable state and nonus agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services the principal us federal laws implicated include those that prohibit i the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment known as the false claims laws ii unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federallyfunded health care programs known as the antikickback laws and iii health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider known as the stark law many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payors insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 

our profitability and international operations are subject to risks relating to changes in us and foreign medical government and private reimbursement programs and policies and changes in us and foreign legal regulatory requirements implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement system in the us and abroad or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them 

the laws and regulations of health care goods and services that are applicable to us including those described above are subject to evolving interpretations if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by cms any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flows 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others 

we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation against us can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products at any given time we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation we believe the results associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages andor royalty payments negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others which would generally have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property our patents trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent applications owned by us may not result in patents being issued to us patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge 

in addition the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

quality problems with and product liability claims in connection with our processes goods and services could lead to recalls or safety alerts harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our cash flows 

quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in addition many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely component failures manufacturing defects design flaws offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient these problems could lead to recall of or issuance of a safety alert relating to our products and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits including class actions which could ultimately result in certain cases in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brands a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future 

in addition our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services if we fail to meet these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts our reputation could be damaged we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precisionengineered components subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situations we also may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 

further we have elected to selfinsure with respect to product liability risks and any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could be costly to defend see our selfinsurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses any of the foregoing problems including product liability claims or product recalls in the future regardless of their ultimate 

outcome could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

health care policy changes including us health care reform legislation signed in 2010 may have a material adverse effect on us 

in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government state governments regulators and thirdparty payers to control these costs and more generally to reform the us health care system certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products the adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in march 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 certain provisions of the law will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood and it is unclear what the full impacts will be from the law the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 23 percent excise tax on all us medical device sales that commenced in january 2013 under the legislation the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately 20 billion over 10 years the law also focuses on a number of medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies the medicare provisions include valuebased payment programs increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination such as bundled physician and hospital payments additionally the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending we cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation however any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our selfinsurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses 

we have elected to selfinsure most of our insurable risks we made this decision based on conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of selfinsurance retentions increasing numbers of coverage limitations and dramatically higher insurance premium rates we maintain a directors and officers policy providing limited coverage and continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to us of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future while based on historical loss trends we believe that our selfinsurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses we cannot guarantee that this will remain true historical trends may not be indicative of future losses the fact that we do not maintain thirdparty insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

if we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will suffer 

we may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers if the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses our results of operations will be adversely affected 

we may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of changes in prices for oil gas and other commodities 

we use resins other petroleumbased materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities oil gas and pulp prices are volatile and may increase resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the costcontainment efforts of our customers and thirdparty payers we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

continuing worldwide economic instability could adversely affect our revenues financial condition or results of operations 

since fiscal year 2008 the global economy has been impacted by the sequential effects of an ongoing global financial crisis this global financial crisis continues to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability during certain periods there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis if at all as with our customers and vendors these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities in addition a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries 

in light of these global economic fluctuations we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the us failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results 

operations in countries outside of the us accounting for approximately 44 percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015 are accompanied by certain financial and other risks we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the us especially in emerging markets which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations our profitability and international operations are and will continue to be subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

 in particular the obama administration has announced potential legislative proposals to tax profits of us companies earned abroad while it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact us they may materially impact our results of operations if for example our profits earned abroad are subject to us income tax or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits 

finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency revenues net of expenses and cash flows we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates the impact of exchange rate changes nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes 

the failure to comply with us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil andor criminal sanctions 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such antibribery laws 

global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more frequent voluntary selfdisclosures by companies aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants sales agents or distributors because these parties are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on 

these legal requirements and discourage improper practices however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees consultants sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

laws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business 

the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the us department of commerce bis administer certain laws and regulations that restrict us persons and in some instances nonus persons in conducting activities transacting business with or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to us economic sanctions due to our international operations we are subject to such laws and regulations which are complex restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals and are constantly changing further restrictions may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations 

from time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions including iran sudan syria cuba and those in the region of crimea certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices and surgical tools and may provide related services to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

many health care industry companies including health care systems are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows would suffer 

our business is indirectly subject to health care industry costcontainment measures that could result in reduced sales of medical devices and medical devices containing our components 

most of our customers and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing efforts of governmental authorities insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these thirdparty payers if thirdparty payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components the costcontainment measures that health care providers are instituting both in the us and internationally could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals 

in an effort to reduce costs many existing and potential customers for our products within the us have become members of group purchase organizations gpos and integrated delivery networks idns gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members gpos and idns typically award contracts on a categorybycategory basis through a competitive bidding process bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting processes we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major gpos and idns across our product portfolio furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products thereby reducing our profitability 

while having a contract with a gpo and idn for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that gpo or idn such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained gpos and idns increasingly are awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a 

gpo or idn for a certain product category members of the gpo or idn generally are free to purchase from other suppliers furthermore gpo and idn contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days’ notice accordingly although we have multiple contracts with many major gpos and idns the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability 

our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful 

our strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas 

we expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

the continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals 

if we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products is dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our products physicians assist us as researchers marketing and product consultants inventors and public speakers if we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or if our products do not operate as intended or we experience a cyberattack or other breach of these systems our business could be materially affected 

we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns as a result of technology initiatives recently enacted regulations changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 

in addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or the company’s proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

negative conditions in the global credit market may impair our commercial paper program our auction rate securities and our other fixed income securities which may cause us losses and liquidity issues 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include us and foreign government and agency securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit debt funds and mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities including auction rate securities market conditions over the past several years have included periods of significant economic uncertainty and at times general market distress especially in the banking and financial services sector during these periods of economic uncertainty we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixedincome investment market including the securities in which we invest in the event we need to sell these securities we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or for a value that is equal to the underlying principal in addition we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the securities and record an impairment charge if we determine that the fair value of such securities is temporarily impaired we would record a temporary impairment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity if it is determined that the fair value of these securities is otherthantemporarily impaired we would record a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

negative market conditions may also impair our ability to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper or debt securities or may impact our ability to sell such securities at a reasonable price and may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institutions 

our products are continually the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the market’s or us fda’s perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 

as part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies we have made several acquisitions in recent years including the recent acquisition of covidien and may make additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include 

 we also could experience negative effects on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges these effects individually or in the aggregate could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 

the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations into marketing and other business practices these investigations could result in the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to rigorous regulation by the us fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us doj and the office of inspector general of hhs these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices 

we cooperate with these investigations and respond to such requests however when an investigation begins we cannot predict when it will be resolved the outcome of the investigation or its impact on us an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil andor criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties andor administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations finally if these investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant administrative burdens including cost on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations or other investigations initiated by the government at any time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business 

as of april 24 2015 our total consolidated external debt was approximately 362 billion we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various jurisdictions outside the us we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example legislation in 2010 imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers for us sales of medical devices beginning in january 2013 proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

in march 2009 the irs issued its audit report for medtronic incs fiscal years 2005 and 2006 medtronic inc reached agreements with the irs on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years on december 23 2010 the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issues medtronic inc filed a petition with the us tax court on march 21 2011 objecting to the deficiency during october and november 2012 medtronic inc reached a resolution with the irs on various matters including the deductibility of a settlement payment medtronic inc and the irs agreed to hold one issue the calculation of amounts eligible for the onetime repatriation holiday because such issue was being addressed by other taxpayers in litigation 

with the irs the remaining unresolved issue relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and its whollyowned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of the companys key manufacturing sites the tax court proceeding with respect to this issue began on february 3 2015 and ended on march 12 2015 the company expects a ruling from the tax court during fiscal year 2017 

examination and audits by tax authorities and covidien’s tax sharing agreement with tyco international plc and te connectivity ltd could result in additional tax payments which could have a material adverse effect on our and covidien’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

on june 29 2007 covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement with tyco international plc tyco international and te connectivity ltd te connectivity pursuant to which covidien tyco international and te connectivity agreed to share 42 27 and 31 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to covidien’s tyco international’s and te connectivity’s us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of covidien’s 2007 separation from tyco international 2007 separation under the tax sharing agreement tyco international currently has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our or covidien’s best interests the other parties to the tax sharing agreement can remove tyco international as the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties 

in connection with the 2007 separation all tax liabilities associated with covidien’s business became covidien’s tax liabilities following covidien’s spinoff of its pharmaceuticals business to covidien shareholders through a distribution of all the outstanding ordinary shares of mallinkrodt 2013 separation mallinckrodt became the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for the tax liabilities attributable to its subsidiaries a significant portion of which relate to periods prior to the 2007 separation however covidien remains the sole party subject to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and te connectivity accordingly mallinckrodt does not share in covidien’s liability to tyco international and te connectivity nor in the receivable that covidien has from tyco international and te connectivity although covidien shares certain tax liabilities with tyco international and te connectivity pursuant to the tax sharing agreement if tyco international and te connectivity default on their obligations to covidien under the tax sharing agreement covidien would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

further if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party’s fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority covidien could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and be required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances covidien may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the agreed upon share of covidien’s tyco international’s and te connectivity’s tax liabilities 

on september 28 2012 tyco international spunoff two of its businesses to its shareholders with tyco international remaining as a publiclytraded company this could have a material adverse impact on tyco international’s ability to fulfill its obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement 

in addition the irs has concluded its field examination of certain of tyco international’s us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and proposed tax adjustments several of which also affect covidien’s income tax returns for years after 2000 tyco international has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the irs and has resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments with respect to the outstanding issue that remains in dispute on june 20 2013 tyco international advised covidien that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tyco international’s former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 914 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco international and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the position taken by the irs is ultimately proved correct the irs has asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tyco international’s intercompany debt originating during the years 1997 through 2000 should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed interest deductions related to the intercompany debt and certain tax attribute adjustments recognized on tyco international’s us income tax returns totaling approximately 30 billion on july 22 2013 tyco international filed a petition with the us tax court contesting the irs assessment the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain and could result in a significant increase in liability for taxes arising during these periods in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would likely assert that approximately 66 billion of interest deductions with respect to tyco international’s intercompany debt in subsequent time periods should also be disallowed 

the company has provided reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions therefore 

any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charges to expense and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if the distribution of mallinckrodt ordinary shares to covidien shareholders in 2013 the distribution of covidien and te connectivity common shares by tyco international to its shareholders in 2007 or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of either the 2013 or the 2007 separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and covidien could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

covidien received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i certain transactions effected in connection with its 2013 separation of mallinckrodt qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code and ii the distribution qualifies as a transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling covidien received a tax opinion from skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp in form and substance acceptable to covidien which relied on the effectiveness of the irs ruling substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution and certain transactions entered into in connection with the distribution qualify as transactions under sections 355 andor 368a of the code 

tyco international has received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of covidien and te connectivity common shares by tyco international to its shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of covidien shares and the te connectivity common shares qualifies as taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation from tyco international qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained tax opinions from the law firm of mcdermott will  emery llp confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions 

the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings a in the case of the 2013 separation from covidien and mallinckrodt and b in the case of the 2007 separation from covidien te connectivity and tyco international regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the tax opinions the irs could determine on audit that the 2013 distribution or the 2007 distribution or the related internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the respective facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distributions or if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinions that are not covered by the irs rulings 

we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that was entered into with mallinckrodt if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2013 distribution are taxable we could also incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of covidien’s separation from tyco international should be treated as taxable transactions 

our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations 

recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence limit the ability of foreignowned corporations to deduct interest expense tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of us corporations impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of us multinational groups and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations 

additionally the us congress government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organisation for economic cooperation and development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the organisation for economic cooperation and development has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business 

moreover us and foreign tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that result from a crossborder business combination such as us which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

a transfer of our shares other than ones effected by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your shares 

in certain limited circumstances dividends we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

in certain limited circumstances dividend withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares a number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the us and other specified countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax 

shareholders resident in the us that hold their shares through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the us and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us however other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their shares 

shareholders entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholders who receive dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividends 

our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €225000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents 

risks relating to the covidien acquisition the transactions 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating medtronic inc and covidien 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the medtronic inc and covidien businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of medtronic inc and covidien the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented 

ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the transaction our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

 many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of medtronic inc and covidien all of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the combination of the medtronic inc and covidien businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

future potential changes to the us tax laws could result in us being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes even so the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code 

under section 7874 of the code if medtronic inc’s shareholders immediately prior to the transaction hold 80 or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction does not have substantial business activities in ireland relative to its worldwide activities the substantial business activities test we would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 of the code medtronic inc’s shareholders received approximately 70 of our ordinary shares by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section 7874 including the application of the ownership test 

in addition changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application 

since section 7874 was enacted there have been various legislative proposals to broaden its scope such proposals could among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation under section 7874 if the former shareholders of the us corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction or if the foreign corporation’s affiliated group has substantial business activities in the us and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the us accordingly if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the transactions such proposals could cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes based on our existing expected cash flows we could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated as a nonus corporation 

specifically if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes we would be subject to us corporate income tax on our worldwide income and the income of our foreign subsidiaries would be subject to us tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the us tax rules for controlled foreign corporations cfcs additionally covidiens foreign 

corporations which are not currently cfcs would become cfcs making them potentially subject to current or future us taxation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the us treasury department and the irs may promulgate rules that would adversely affect our tax position 

the us treasury department has announced that it is examining possible changes in the regulatory rules affecting companies that move their tax domicile outside the us in the event the us treasury department and the irs were to change the applicable regulatory rules we could face potentially substantial tax costs as a result of the transactions we are unable to assess the potential impact of any such possible changes if adopted until they are announced 

on september 22 2014 the us treasury department and the irs issued new guidance announcing their intention to issue regulations interpreting multiple sections of the code including section 7874 to address inversion transactions and transactions that treasury and the irs characterize as “postinversion tax avoidance transactions” the irs notice when issued such regulations would apply to transactions completed on or after september 22 2014 the regulations described in the irs notice would expand the set of circumstances under which section 7874 applies to cause the foreign acquirer of a us corporation to be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes such regulations would also impose additional us taxes on certain transactions involving the acquired us corporation’s cfc’s 

the regulations interpreting section 7874 of the code announced in the irs notice are not expected to cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes however if ultimately upheld by a reviewing court the regulations announced in the irs notice would be expected to limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transactions involving nonus subsidiaries 

in addition in the irs notice the us treasury department and the irs announced their intention to issue additional guidance in the future intended to restrict our ability to undertake certain transactions which could reduce our us tax liability according to the irs notice such guidance may include among other things limitations on our ability to deduct interest on certain intercompany debt for us federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such guidance will be issued the nature of regulations that may be promulgated thereunder or the effect such guidance may have on our business 

the transaction may not allow us to maintain competitive global cash management and a low effective corporate tax rate 

while we believe that being incorporated in ireland should help us maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be however because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business

 item 5 market for medtronic’s common equity related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

the company’s ordinary shares are listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “mdt” 

in january 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the adoption of the existing medtronic inc share redemption program as of april 24 2015  the company had used 503 million  of the 80 million shares authorized under the january 2015 share redemption program in june 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the redemption of an additional 80 million  of the companys ordinary shares as authorized by the board of directors our share redemption program expires when the total number of authorized shares have been redeemed 

the following table provides information about shares redeemed by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 



on june 16 2015 there were approximately 53730 shareholders of record of the company’s ordinary shares ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 305 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2015  and 28 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2014  the following prices are the high and low market sales quotations per share of the company’s ordinary shares for the quarters indicated

irish restrictions on import and export of capital 

the financial transfers act 1992 provides that the irish minister for finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between ireland and other countries for the purposes of this act “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the european communities if they had been made between member states of the communities this act has been used by the minister for finance to implement european council directives which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries organizations and people including the alqaeda network and the taliban afghanistan belarus burma myanmar democratic people’s republic of korea democratic republic of congo egypt eritrea iran iraq ivory coast lebanon liberia libya republic of guinea somalia sudan and syria 

irish taxes applicable to us holders 

dividends paid by medtronic will generally be subject to irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax currently 20 percent unless an exemption applies 

dividends paid to us residents will not be subject to irish dividend withholding tax provided that 

• in the case of a beneficial owner   of medtronic shares held in the depository trust company dtc the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the united states and this information is provided by the broker to the company’s qualifying intermediary or 

• in the case of a record owner the record owner has provided to the company’s transfer agent a valid us certification of residence form 6166 or valid irish nonresident form v2 

irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on medtronic’s ordinary shares a us resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold medtronic shares through a branch or agency in ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by medtronic in addition if a us shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax the withholding payment discharges any irish income tax liability provided the shareholder furnishes to the irish revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed 

while the usireland double tax treaty contains provisions regarding withholding due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under irish domestic law it would generally be unnecessary for a us resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

understanding our financial information

our fiscal yearend is the last friday in april and therefore the total weeks in a fiscal year can fluctuate between 52 and 53 weeks fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  were 52week years fiscal year 2016 is a 53week year with the additional week occurring in the first quarter 

executive level overview 

medtronic is the global leader in medical technology  alleviating pain restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world we develop manufacture and market our medical devices and technologies in approximately 160 countries our primary products prior to the covidien acquisition included those for cardiac rhythm disorders cardiovascular disease neurological disorders spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma urological and digestive disorders and ear nose and throat and diabetes conditions as a result of the covidien acquisition our products were expanded to include advanced and general surgical care and patient care products including respiratory and monitoring solutions 

net income for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  was 2675 billion  241  per diluted share as compared to net income of 3065 billion  302  per diluted share for the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  representing a decrease of 13 percent and 20 percent respectively 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  



 net sales in fiscal year 2015  were 20261 billion  an increase of 19 percent  from the prior fiscal year foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 666 million on net sales compared to the prior fiscal year net sales growth for fiscal year 2015  was driven by 6 percent  growth in our cardiac and vascular group 4 percent  growth in our restorative therapies group and 6 percent  growth in our diabetes group compared to the prior fiscal year and the addition of 2387 billion  of revenue during the fourth quarter from our minimally invasive therapies group due to the acquisition of covidien which closed on january 26 2015 the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was primarily a result of strong net sales in aortic and peripheral with the addition of a portion of covidiens peripheral business and growth in cardiac rhythm  heart failure and coronary  structural heart the restorative therapies group’s performance was a result of solid growth in surgical technologies and growth in neuromodulation partially offset by a decline in spine the diabetes groups performance was due to solid growth in the us driven by the ongoing launch of the minimed 530g system within the minimally invasive therapies group the surgical solutions and patient monitoring  recovery divisions contributed 1293 billion  and 1094 billion  of revenue respectively see our discussion in the “net sales” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for more information on the results of our operating segments 

acquisition of covidien    on january 26 2015 pursuant to the transaction agreement we acquired covidien to continue in our mission to create a medical technology and services company with a comprehensive product portfolio and a broad global reach that is better able to improve healthcare outcomes covidien meaningfully accelerates our core strategies of therapy innovation globalization and economic value the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date 

for further information regarding the acquisition see the section entitled “acquisition and investments  acquisition of covidien” contained in “item 1 business” and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k the full text of the transaction agreement was filed as exhibit 21 to our amendment no 5 to the registration statement on form s4 filed with the sec on november 20 2014 

net income gaap to nongaap reconciliation the following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with us gaap to those results after giving effect to adjustments relating to items or charges considered by management to be unusual or infrequent refer to our discussion in the cost and expenses section of this managements discussion and analysis for more information on these reconciling items 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses these estimates reflect managements best judgment about economic and market conditions and their potential effects on the valuation andor carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources see also note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

revenue recognition the company records price adjustment rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized we estimate rebates based on sales terms historical experience and trend analyses subsequent to the january 26 2015 acquisition of covidien we reevaluated the judgments used by management of the company in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts for revenues expenses assets and liabilities related to revenue recognition based upon the lag time between the original sale to distributors at list price and the related distributor rebate claim earned at time of sale to the end customer and the judgments involved in estimating such rebates we consider price adjustment rebates for covidien to be a critical accounting estimate we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant covidien price adjustment rebates charged against gross sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 were 679 million 

legal proceedings   we are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability intellectual property disputes shareholder derivative actions securities class actions other class actions income tax matters and environmental matters the outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages as well as other relief including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation governmental proceedings and income tax matters involving the company are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k while it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the matters discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we believe it is possible that costs associated with them could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial position or cash flows 

income taxes     our effective tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail these reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of us gaap under us gaap if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position or cash flows 

in the event there is a nongaap adjustment recognized in our operating results the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by these discrete items that take place in the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the nongaap nominal tax rate the nongaap nominal tax rate is defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes excluding nongaap adjustments we believe this resulting nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it excludes the effect of these discrete items so that investors can compare our recurring results over multiple periods investors should consider this nongaap measure in addition to and not as a substitute for financial performance measures prepared in accordance with us gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure may not be the same or similar to measures presented by other companies 

tax regulations require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when those items are required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a result our effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income 

the company’s overall tax rate from continuing operations including the tax impact of nongaap adjustments resulted in an effective tax rate of 233  percent for fiscal year 2015  excluding the impact of the nongaap adjustments our operational and tax strategies have resulted in a nongaap nominal tax rate of 182  percent versus the us federal statutory rate of 350 percent an increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  of approximately 58 million see discussion of our tax rate and the tax adjustments in the “income taxes” section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

valuation of intangible assets  intangible assets include patents trademarks tradenames customer relationships purchased technology and iprd when we acquire a business the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date iprd represents the fair value of those rd projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates these estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks the fair value assigned to iprd is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values the discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies there is risk that actual results will differ materially from the original cash flow projections due to the uncertainty associated with rd projects in addition there are risks associated with achieving product commercialization these risks include but are not limited to delays or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials delays or failure to obtain required market clearances or delays or issues with patent issuance validity and litigation 

our impairment reviews of other intangible assets are based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates we use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated the results of our annual impairment test are discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 

financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including among others changes in competitive conditions timing of regulatory approval results of clinical trials changes in worldwide economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these risk factors are discussed in “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 28101 billion  and 2286 billion  as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  respectively 

goodwill  goodwill is the excess of the purchase price consideration over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses the test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flows our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value including projected future cash flows the results of annual impairment test are discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k goodwill was 40530 billion  and 10593 billion  as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  respectively 

contingent consideration  contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at estimated fair value the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as income or expense within acquisitionrelated items  in our consolidated statements of income changes to the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in discount rates the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or probability of achieving the milestones which trigger payment the fair value of contingent consideration was 264 million  and 68 million  as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  respectively 

net sales 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we amended the way in which we evaluate performance and allocate resources with the acquisition of covidien as a result we began to operate under four reportable segments and four operating segments the cardiac and vascular group composed of cardiac rhythm  heart failure coronary  structural heart and aortic  peripheral vascular businesses the minimally invasive therapies group composed of surgical solutions and patient monitoring  recovery the restorative therapies group composed of the spine neuromodulation surgical technologies neurovascular businesses and the diabetes group see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion related to our segment reporting 

the table below illustrates net sales by operating segment and division for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  



the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to the covidien acquisition in fiscal years 2015  and 2014  net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of 666 million and 175 million respectively the primary exchange rate movements that impacted our consolidated net sales growth were the us dollar as compared to the euro and the 

japanese yen the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales was not indicative of the impact on net income due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses and our hedging activities see “item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk” and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for further details on foreign currency instruments and our related risk management strategies 

cardiac and vascular group  the cardiac and vascular group is composed of the cardiac rhythm  heart failure coronary  structural heart and aortic  peripheral vascular divisions the cardiac and vascular group’s products with specific focus on comprehensive disease management include pacemakers insertable and external cardiac monitors implantable defibrillators leads and delivery systems ablation products electrophysiology catheters products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation information systems for the management of patients with cardiac rhythm  heart failure devices products designed to reduce surgical site infections coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems endovascular stent graft systems heart valve replacement technologies cardiac tissue ablation systems and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products the cardiac and vascular group also includes cardiocom and cath lab managed services clms the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 9361 billion  an increase of 6  percent compared to the prior fiscal year foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 296 million compared to the prior fiscal year the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was primarily a result of strong net sales in cardiac rhythm  heart failure and aortic  peripheral vascular and solid growth in coronary  structural heart see the more detailed discussion of each business’s performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 5245 billion  an increase of 5 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales was driven by the ongoing acceptance of the reveal linq insertable cardiac monitor and the launches of the viva xt crtd with attain performa quadripolar crtd lead system in the us in september 2014 and evera mri surescan icd in japan in november 2014 net sales of the cardiac rhythm  heart failure division were also driven by the continued global acceptance of the arctic front advance cardiac cryoablation catheter arctic front system net sales from cardiocom and our clms business which includes the august 2014 acquisition of ngc net sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 3038 billion  an increase of 3 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in coronary  structural heart net sales was driven by ongoing success of the corevalve transcatheter aortic heart valve in the us the launch of the corevalve evolute r recapturable system in international markets and the international launch of the resolute onyx drugeluting stent in november 2014 net sales were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued pricing pressures in the us western europe japan and india in our coronary business 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 1078 billion  an increase of 20 percent  compared to the prior fiscal year the aortic  peripheral vascular division includes a portion of the covidien peripheral business which contributed strong performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 on the strength of its chronic venous insufficiency products the increase in aortic  peripheral vascular net sales was driven by inpact admiral drugcoated balloons in the us and international markets aortic  peripheral vascular net sales were also driven by strong sales of our valiant captivia thoracic stent graft system and growth from the endurant 2s abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa stent graft system in the us and western europe net sales for the aortic  peripheral vascular division were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation and increased competitive and pricing pressures in the us western europe and japan 

the cardiac and vascular groups net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 8847 billion an increase of 2 percent compared to the prior fiscal year foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of 118 million compared to the prior fiscal year the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was primarily a result of solid growth in aortic  peripheral vascular and growth in cardiac rhythm  heart failure and coronary  structural heart additionally the cardiac and vascular group’s performance was favorably affected by new products and the august 2013 acquisition of cardiocom and january 2014 acquisition of tyrx see the more detailed discussion of each business’s performance below 

cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 4996 billion an increase of 2 percent compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in cardiac rhythm  heart failure net sales were driven by continued global acceptance of the arctic front system and the launches of our advisa dr mri surescan in the us and japan in the fourth and second quarters of fiscal year 2013 respectively net sales of cardiac rhythm  heart failure were also impacted by the continued acceptance of our shock reduction and lead integrity alert technologies and our vivabrava family of crtd devices and evera family of icds a strong launch of reveal linq in western europe and the us in the second half of fiscal year 2014 and net sales from the acquisition of cardiocom and clms also contributed to the increase in net sales net sales for the cardiac rhythm  heart failure were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation declines in the us high power and low power markets and pricing pressures in certain international markets 

coronary  structural heart net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 2956 billion an increase of 2 percent compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in coronary  structural heart net sales were driven by strong sales of the corevalve transcatheter aortic heart valves in western europe and of our perfusion system and blood management products in emerging markets growth was also driven by a strong initial us launch of corevalve transcatheter aortic heart valves for extreme risk patients in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 the increase in net sales was also due to worldwide share gains in drugeluting stents driven by the continued strength of our resolute integrity drugeluting coronary stent growth was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation pricing pressures and declines in our cardiopulmonary product lines driven principally by a competitors full reentry into the market following a supply disruption and by unfavorable foreign currency translation 

aortic  peripheral vascular net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 895 million an increase of 3 percent compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in aortic  peripheral vascular net sales was driven by strong sales of our valiant captivia thoracic stent graft system as well as the launch of the endurant ii aaa stent graft system in japan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 growth was partially offset by the divestiture of a reentry catheter product line in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 the removal of a peripheral belowtheknee product from the market unfavorable foreign currency translation and increased competitive and pricing pressures in the us western europe and japan 

looking ahead we expect our cardiac and vascular group could be impacted by the following

net sales contributions in surgical solutions included strong performance in both stapling and energy stapling results benefitted from the rollout of new products including the endo gia reinforced reload while energy results included strong procedural volumes in vessel sealing gi solutions advanced ablation and interventional lung solutions results in early technologies also contributed to net sales 

net sales contributions in patient monitoring  recovery were led by solid performance in patient monitoring as a result of the us flu season which drove pulse oximetry sales 

looking ahead we expect minimally invasive therapies group could be impacted by the following 

 restorative therapies group  the restorative therapies group is composed of the spine neuromodulation surgical technologies and neurovascular divisions the restorative therapies group includes products for various areas of the spine bone graft substitutes biologic products trauma implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain movement disorders obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd overactive bladder urinary retention fecal

spine net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 2971 billion  a decrease of 2 percent  over the prior fiscal year the decrease in spines net sales for fiscal year 2015  was driven by declines in core spine and interventional partially offset by growth in bmp composed of infuse bone graft inductos in the eu both the global and us core spine markets grew in the lowsingle digits with modest procedural growth offset by continued pricing pressures during fiscal year 2015 the core spine business continued to focus on differentiating itself over the longterm through portfolio updates procedural innovation and continued development and deployment of the its surgical synergy program that integrates imaging navigation and powered surgical instruments fiscal year 2015 included several new product launches including our prestige lp cervical disc and pure titanium coated ptc interbodies spacers which partially offset declines in core spine interventional spine net sales decline was driven by a decline in european sales where the business faced pricing pressures in germany and unfavorable foreign currency translation underlying demand for bmp stabilized and returned to slight growth in the latter half of fiscal year 2015 

neuromodulation net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 1977 billion  an increase of 4 percent  over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was primarily due to strong growth in gastrouro and growth in dbs and pain stimulation our global focus on our neurologist referral programs and the strength of the earlystim data in international markets continues to drive solid growth of dbs systems implant growth of our interstim therapy for overactive bladder urinary retention and bowel incontinence continued in the us throughout fiscal year 2015 the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2015 was also due to global growth of our restoresensor surescan mri system while the us pain stimulation market has weakened as a result of reimbursement changes net sales of our surescan mri system for the fiscal year demonstrate our continued strength in the market 

surgical technologies net sales for fiscal year 2015  were 1671 billion  an increase of 7 percent  over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was driven by continued worldwide net sales growth across the portfolio of advanced energy ent and neurosurgery partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation performance was driven by strong growth of power systems aquamantys transcollation and peak plasmablade technologies as well as solid growth of midas rex products monitoring and oarm imaging systems additionally net sales growth was positively impacted by launch of our nuvent sinus balloons in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the acquisition of visualase during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 adding a mriguided laser ablation technology to our broad suite of neuroscience solutions for neurosurgery the increase in revenue from visualase and our nuvent sinus balloons was partially offset by our divestiture of the microfrance product line during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 

neurovascular net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 132 million  the division formerly part of covidien contributed revenue from the strength of its coils stents flow diversion and access product lines the new england journal of medicine published several positive clinical trials on our solitaire fr revascularization device resulting in continued customer adoption of the product additionally net sales were positively impacted by the us launch of the pipeline flex embolization device which was launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 

the restorative therapies group’s net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 6501 billion an increase of 2 percent over the prior fiscal year foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 58 million when compared to the prior fiscal year the restorative therapies group’s performance for fiscal year 2014 was favorably impacted by strong net sales in surgical technologies and growth in neuromodulation partially offset by declines in spine primarily driven by bmp and balloon kyphoplasty bkp see the more detailed discussion of each businesss performance below 

spine net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 3041 billion a decrease of 3 percent over the prior fiscal year the decrease in spines net sales for fiscal year 2014 was primarily driven by declines in bmp and bkp and unfavorable foreign currency translation net sales in bkp for fiscal year 2014 declined compared to the prior fiscal year due to increased competition pricing pressures and reimbursement challenges with select payers significant declines in us sales of infuse bone graft resulted from the june 2011 articles in the spine journal in addition some surgeons reduced their usage through both patient selection and the use of smaller kits core spines lowsingle digit decline for fiscal year 2014 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and negative performance in bkp as discussed above which were substantially offset by recent launches of our new products and therapies including product line extensions to our vertex platform 

and bryan artificial cervical disc as well as the continued adoption of other biologics products the global core spine markets were relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis during fiscal year 2014 core spine benefited from our focus on enabling technologies including the oarm imaging system stealthstation navigation and powerease powered surgical instruments 

neuromodulation net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 1898 billion an increase of 5 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was primarily due to 8 percent growth in international markets strong global growth of our activa dbs systems for movement disorders driven by new implant growth and strong performance from our conditionally safe surescan mri system we received us fda approval for our conditionally safe surescan mri system earlier than anticipated and transitioned manufacturing in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 to the surescan mri system resulting in supply constraints which continued through early in the second fiscal quarter of 2014 growth in sales of our interstim therapy for overactive bladder urinary retention and bowel incontinence continued during fiscal year 2014 although at a slower rate compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of increased competition from nondevice therapies 

surgical technologies net sales for fiscal year 2014 were 1562 billion an increase of 10 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was driven by continued worldwide net sales growth across the portfolio of ent neurosurgery and advanced energy partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation growth was driven by strong sales of navigation power systems monitoring aquamantys transcollation peak plasmablade technologies and strata adjustable valves additionally net sales growth was positively impacted by the late fiscal year 2013 launches of the trivantage emg tube in the us and indigo highspeed otologic drill internationally 

looking ahead we expect our restorative therapies group could be affected by the following

 diabetes group    the diabetes group products include insulin pumps cgm systems insulin pump consumables and therapy management software the diabetes group’s net sales for fiscal year 2015 were 1762 billion  an increase of 6  percent over the prior fiscal year the diabetes group’s performance was primarily the result of 9 percent growth in the us compared to the prior fiscal year driven by the ongoing launch of the minimed 530g system with enlite sensor approval was obtained late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 net sales in the international markets increased 2 percent compared to the prior fiscal year performance in international markets was favorably affected by the launch of our nextgeneration minimed 640g system with the enhanced enlite cgm sensor in australia and europe partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency 

the diabetes group’s net sales for fiscal year 2014  were 1657 billion  an increase of 9 percent over the prior fiscal year the increase in net sales was driven by us sales of the minimed 530g system with enlite sensor as well as 23 million of revenue recognized that was deferred in fiscal year 2013 as some customers upgraded to the minimed 530g system after it was released in the us net sales in the international markets increased 9 percent compared to the prior fiscal year performance in international markets was favorably affected by the continued adoption and use of the veo insulin pump with lowglucose suspend and enlite cgm sensor 

looking ahead we expect our diabetes group could be impacted by the following 

 

operations by market geography 

the graph below illustrates net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  

the table below illustrates net sales by market geography for each of our operating segments for fiscal years 2015  and 2014  



for fiscal year 2015  net sales for the us increased 22 percent developed markets outside the us increased 13 percent and emerging markets increased 23 percent compared to the prior fiscal year foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 666 million on net sales for fiscal year 2015  net sales growth in nonus developed markets was driven by the addition of the minimally invasive therapies group in the fourth quarter as a result of the covidien acquisition offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation emerging markets growth was led by strong growth in the restorative therapies group and diabetes solid growth in the cardiac and vascular group and the addition of the minimally invasive therapies group in the fourth quarter as a result of the covidien acquisition partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 

for fiscal year 2014  net sales for the us increased 2 percent nonus developed markets remained flat and emerging markets increased 13 percent over the prior fiscal year foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 175 million on net sales for fiscal year 2014  net sales growth outside of the us was led by strong emerging market growth in diabetes the restorative therapies group and the cardiac  vascular group partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 

net sales outside the us are accompanied by certain financial risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and collection of receivables which typically have longer payment terms we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business however a significant amount of our outstanding accounts receivable are with international customers we continue to monitor the economic conditions in many countries outside the us and the average length of time it takes to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries although we do not currently foresee a significant credit risk associated with a material portion of these receivables repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries 

costs and expenses 

the following is a summary of major costs and expenses as a percent of net sales 



cost of products sold  cost of products sold was 6309 billion  in fiscal year 2015  representing 311  percent of net sales reflecting an increase of 56 of a percentage points from fiscal year 2014  the increase is primarily related to the acquisition of covidien during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the related inventory fair value adjustment amortization which totaled 623 million  and covidiens lower average margin for its products additionally the increase was also attributable to a technology upgrade commitment which totaled 74 million  related to a crhf global comprehensive program for home based monitors due to industry conversion from analog to digital technology and a 15 million  restructuring charge for inventory writeoffs of discontinued product lines we anticipate an additional 208 million of inventory fair value adjustment amortization in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 

cost of products sold was 4333 billion  in fiscal year 2014  representing 255  percent of net sales reflecting an increase of 06 of a percentage point from fiscal year 2013  cost of products sold as a percent of net sales was negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable foreign currency additional spending to address quality issues in the neuromodulation business and diabetes group and 10 million of expense recorded within cost of products sold during fiscal year 2014 related to the fiscal year 2014 restructuring initiative for inventory writeoffs of discontinued product lines 

research and development    during fiscal year 2015 we continued to invest in new technologies to drive future growth research and development expense for fiscal year 2015  was 1640 billion  representing 81  percent of net sales a decrease of 06 of a percentage point from fiscal year 2014  due to the acquisition of covidien the company expects research and development as a percentage of net sales to range between 7 and 8 percent in fiscal year 2016 

research and development expense for fiscal year 2014  was 1477 billion  representing 87  percent of net sales a decrease of 07 of a percentage point from fiscal year 2013  the decrease for fiscal year 2014 was driven by a shift in research and development resources to investment in product support to enhance our quality systems in the neuromodulation business and diabetes group 

we remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet medical needs that commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high furthermore we expect our development activities to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future in addition to our investment in research and development we continue to access new technologies in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas through acquisitions licensing agreements alliances and certain strategic equity investments 

selling general and administrative  fiscal year 2015  selling general and administrative expense was 6904 billion  representing 341  percent of net sales reflecting a decrease of 03 of a percentage point from fiscal year 2014  this decrease was primarily driven by several initiatives focused on leveraging our expenses 

fiscal year 2014  selling general and administrative expense was 5847 billion  representing 344  percent of net sales reflecting an increase of 01 of a percentage point from fiscal year 2013  this increase was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation 

special gains charges net    during fiscal year 2015  we recognized special gains of 138 million  which consisted of a 41 million  gain on the sale of a product line in the surgical technologies division and a 97 million  gain on the sale of an equity method investment  

during fiscal years 2015  and 2014 consistent with our commitment to improving the health of people and communities throughout the world we made charitable contributions of 100 million  and 40 million respectively to the medtronic foundation which is a related party nonprofit organization 

during fiscal year 2013  there were no special gains charges net 

restructuring charges net    we incur restructuring charges in connection with our costreduction and productivity initiatives or with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations amounts recognized as restructuring charges result from a series of judgments and estimates about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on assumptions upon implementation of the initiative programs restructuring programs will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods currently we have   several initiative programs in various states of progress with total restructuring liabilities of 233 million  and 99 million  at april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  respectively during fiscal year 2015 we incurred 286 million in restructuring charges which were partially offset by a 34 million reversal of excess restructuring reserves 

we began our restructuring program related to the acquisition of covidien in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we anticipate approximately 850 million in cost synergies to be achieved as a result of the covidien acquisition through fiscal year 2018 including administrative office optimization manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure and certain general and administrative savings restructuring charges are expected to be incurred on a quarterly basis throughout fiscal year 2016 as restructuring programs are finalized restructuring charges are expected to be primarily related to employee termination costs and costs related to manufacturingbuilding site closures no assurance can be provided that such cost synergies will be achieved on such timing or at all see “item 1a risk factors we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating medtronic inc and covidien

in fiscal year 2014  other expense net was  181 million  an increase of 73 million from  108 million  in the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the us medical device excise tax that went into effect january 1 2013 partially offset by net realized foreign currency gains in addition the increase in fiscal year 2014 was partially offset by income from a license related to our aortic  peripheral vascular business the us medical device excise tax in fiscal year 2014 was 112 million compared to 21 million in the prior fiscal year total net realized foreign currency gains recorded in other expense net  were 43 million in fiscal year 2014  compared to gains of 27 million in the prior fiscal year

in fiscal year 2014  interest expense net was  108 million  as compared to  151 million  in fiscal year 2013 in fiscal year 2014  the decrease in interest expense net was the result of decreased interest expense due to reduced amortization of debt discount as a result of the april 2013 repayment of 2200 billion of senior convertible notes partially offset by increased debt the decrease in interest expense net was also due to increased interest income from higher investment balances as compared to fiscal year 2013

income taxes 



 our effective tax rate from continuing operations of 233 percent increased by 60 percentage points from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015 the increase in our effective tax rate was due to the net tax impact of special gains charges net restructuring charges net certain litigation charges net acquisitionrelated items certain tax adjustments the impact from the acquisition of covidien and the operational tax benefits described below 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 182 percent compared to 192 percent in the prior fiscal year the decrease in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the covidien acquisition operational tax benefits and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction 

during fiscal year 2015 we recorded 33 million in operational tax benefits the retroactive renewal and extension of the us federal research and development tax credit resulted in a 12 million operational tax benefit for fiscal year 2015 in addition we recorded a 9 million benefit associated with foreign dividend distributions and a 12 million net benefit associated with the resolution of us federal state and foreign income tax audits finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves 

the fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate from continuing operations of 173 percent decreased by 11 percentage points from fiscal year 2013 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the tax impact of special charges restructuring charges net certain litigation charges net acquisitionrelated items the certain tax adjustments recorded during fiscal year 2014 and other factors impacting our nongaap nominal tax rate as discussed below 

our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was 192 percent compared to 190 percent in the prior fiscal year the increase in our nongaap nominal tax rate for fiscal year 2014 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the extension of the us federal research and development tax credit on january 2 2013 for calendar years 2012 and 2013 and the expiration of such extension on december 31 2013 the finalization of certain income tax returns changes to uncertain tax position reserves the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation and amortization deductions were previously limited the tax impact of foreign dividend distributions and yearoveryear changes in operational results by jurisdiction

liquidity and capital resources 





as of april 24 2015  we believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility in the future we believe our existing cash and investments as well as our new 3500 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility dated as of january 26 2015 and related 3500 billion 2015 commercial paper program entered into on january 26 2015 no commercial paper outstanding as of april 24 2015  will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements from time to time we also may consider repayments redemptions or repurchases for cash of our outstanding indebtedness by means of one or more tender offers or otherwise subsequent to april 24 2015  we retired 1000 billion of maturing debt using existing cash 

on december 10 2014 medtronic inc issued seven tranches of senior notes collectively the 2015 senior notes with an aggregate face value of 17 billion which are guaranteed by the company in addition on january 26 2015 the company borrowed 3000 billion for a term of three years under the term loan credit agreement the company used these combined proceeds to fund the approximately 16 billion cash consideration portion of the january 26 2015 estimated 50 billion acquisition of covidien and to pay certain transaction and financing expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the companys longterm debt 



1 agency ratings are subject to change and there can be no assurance that a ratings agency will continue to provide ratings andor maintain its current ratings a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

as expected subsequent to the closing of our acquisition of covidien on january 26 2015 and january 27 2015 sp ratings services and moodys respectively lowered medtronic’s shortterm debt rating and longterm debt rating due to the increase in net leverage as a result of the covidien transaction and related financing 

we do not expect moodys and sp ratings services rating downgrades to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet our 3500 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility and related 3500 billion 2015 commercial paper program discussed above and within the “debt and capital” section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

our net cash position in fiscal year 2015 decreased by 19019 billion  as compared to fiscal year 2014 and resulted primarily from the 17 billion 2015 senior notes and 3 billion borrowed under the term loan credit agreement to fund the approximately 16 billion cash consideration portion of the acquisition of covidien to pay certain transaction and financing expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness see the “summary of cash flows” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

we have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position or cash flows see the “offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations” section of this management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k provide information regarding amounts we have accrued related to significant legal proceedings in accordance with us gaap we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  we have made payments related to certain legal proceedings for information regarding these charges please see the “special gains charges net restructuring charges net certain litigation charges net acquisitionrelated items and certain tax adjustments” section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014 approximately 177 billion and 140 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities were held by our nonus subsidiaries as we continue to focus on goals to grow our business globally and emerging markets continue to be a significant driver of this growth this has resulted in us permanently reinvesting our nonus cash in our nonus operations although our current intent remains that these funds be indefinitely reinvested in nonus subsidiaries from time to time we evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations if the portion of these funds held by us controlled nonus subsidiaries were repatriated to the us the amounts would generally be subject to us tax we provide for tax liabilities in our financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested outside of ireland our current plans do not foresee a need to repatriate earnings that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations or meet currently anticipated liquidity and capital investment needs 

we have investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale our debt securities include us government and agency securities foreign government and agency securities corporate debt securities certificates of deposit mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities debt funds and auction rate securities some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand our auction rate security holdings have experienced reduced liquidity in recent years due to changes in investor demand although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss 

for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  the total otherthantemporary impairment losses on availableforsale debt securities were not significant based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested we believe we have recorded all necessary otherthantemporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost however as of april 24 2015  we have 174 million  of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate shortterm and longterm availableforsale debt securities of 14666 billion  if market conditions deteriorate some of these holdings may experience otherthantemporary impairment in the future which could have a material impact on our financial results management is required to use estimates and assumptions in its valuation of our investments which requires a high degree of judgment and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding fair value measurements 

summary of cash flows 



operating activities    our net cash provided by operating activities was 4902 billion  decreasing 57 million for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  compared to 4959 billion  for the prior year the slight yearoveryear decrease is primarily the result of certain covidien acquisition impacts including acquisitionrelated items accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes offset by the 750 million settlement payment made to edwards in may 2014 

our net cash provided by operating activities was 4959 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  increasing 17 million compared to 4942 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 26 2013

our net cash provided in investing activities was 3594 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  compared to 3101 billion  for the prior year the 493 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to increased net purchases of marketable securities compared to the prior fiscal year partially offset by higher levels of cash used in the prior year for acquisitions primarily related to kanghui 

financing activities     we had net cash provided by financing activities of 15949 billion  for the fiscal year ended april 24 2015  compared to 918 million  used in financing activities the prior year the 16867 billion increase in financing activities primarily resulted from a net increase in issuances of longterm debt net of payments on longterm debt and shortterm borrowings partially offset by a decrease in net issuance and repurchases of ordinary shares compared to the prior fiscal year 

we had net cash used in financing activities of 918 million  for the fiscal year ended april 25 2014  compared to 2101 billion  for the prior fiscal year the 1183 billion decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a 1457 billion decrease in net payments in excess of issuances on longterm debt and shortterm borrowings partially offset by a 266 million increase in ordinary share repurchases net of issuances compared to the prior fiscal year 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents the cash that we have available to pursue opportunities that we believe enhance shareholder value management uses this nongaap financial measure in addition to us gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating results free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure which should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow are as follows 



we returned 53  percent 48  percent and 41  percent of our operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payments free cash flow returned to shareholders was 60  percent 52  percent and 45  percent in fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

debt and capital 

our capital structure consists of equity and interestbearing debt interestbearing debt as a percentage of total interestbearing debt and equity was 40 percent  as of april 24 2015  and 38 percent  as of april 25 2014  

as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders shares are repurchased from time to time in january 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the adoption of the existing medtronic inc share redemption program during fiscal years 2015  and 2014  we repurchased a total of 298 million  and 478 million  shares at an average price of 6453  and 5337  respectively as of april 24 2015  we have approximately 297 million  shares remaining under the current board authorization in june 2015 the companys board of directors authorized subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves the redemption of an additional 80 million  of the companys ordinary shares 

we use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our shortterm financing needs shortterm debt including the current portion of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations as of april 24 2015  was 2434 billion  compared to 1613 billion  as of april 25 2014  

we maintain a commercial paper program for short term financing which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 3500 billion we previously maintained a commercial paper program that allowed us to have a maximum of 2250 billion in commercial paper outstanding with maturities up to 364 days from the date of issuance no amounts were outstanding under either of these programs as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  respectively 

during fiscal years 2015  and 2014  the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 52 and 53 days respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 013 percent  and 009 percent  respectively the issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit as explained below 

we also have a 3500 billion syndicated line of credit facility 3500 billion revolving credit facility which expires in january 2020 the current 3500 billion revolving credit facility was amended and restated from a previous 2250 billion line of credit facility upon the close of the transaction the 3500 billion revolving credit facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes the 3500 billion revolving credit facility provides us with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional 500 million at any time during the term of the agreement at each anniversary date of the 3500 billion revolving credit facility but not more than twice prior to the maturity date the company could also request a one year extension of the maturity date as of april 24 2015  and april 25 2014  no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credits 

interest rates on advances on our 3500 billion revolving credit facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our longterm debt ratings assigned by sp ratings services and moody’s for additional information on our credit ratings status by sp ratings services and moodys refer to liquidity and capital resources section of this managements discussion and analysis facility fees are payable on the credit facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates the agreements also contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with as of april 24 2015  

we utilize senior notes that are unsecured senior obligations that rank equally with all other secured and unsubordinated indebtedness to meet our longterm financing needs we use the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes and in the case of senior notes issued on december 10 2014 to finance the covidien acquisition and related expenses longterm debt as of april 24 2015  was 33752 billion  compared to 10315 billion  as of april 25 2014  the indentures under which the senior notes have been issued contain customary covenants all of which we remain in compliance with as of april 24 2015  

as of january 26 2015 covidien had 5000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued and outstanding on which the company recorded a fair value adjustment as required upon acquisition which resulted in a premium totaling 607  million 

on december 10 2014 we issued seven tranches of the 2015 senior notes with an aggregate face value of 17 billion in addition on january 26 2015 we also borrowed 3000 billion for a term of three years under a term loan agreement we used these combined proceeds to fund the approximately 16 billion cash consideration portion of the approximately 50 billion acquisition of covidien to pay certain transaction and financing expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness 

in february 2014 the company issued four tranches of senior notes collectively the 2014 senior notes with an aggregate face value of 2000 billion the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2014 senior notes for working capital and general corporate purposes including repayment of our indebtedness

offbalance sheet arrangements and longterm contractual obligations 

we acquire assets still in development enter into research and development arrangements and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone andor royalty payments to a thirdparty contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of a product or upon certain predesignated levels of achievement in clinical trials in addition if required by the arrangement we may have to make royalty payments based on a percentage of sales related to the product under development or in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment we have included those milestone or minimum royalty payments in the following table however the majority of these arrangements give us the discretion to unilaterally make the decision to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments although we are unlikely to cease development if a device successfully achieves clinical testing objectives these payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations because of the contingent nature of these payments and our ability to avoid them if we decided to pursue a different path of development or testing see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe thirdparty patents or other intellectual property our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our commitments table historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

we believe our offbalance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings financial position or cash flows presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments as of april 24 2015  see notes 8 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding longterm debt and lease obligations respectively additionally see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding accrued income tax obligations which are not reflected in the table below

we undertake no obligation to update any statement we make but investors are advised to consult all other disclosures by us in our filings with the securities and exchange commission especially on forms 10k 10q and 8k in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results in addition actual results may differ materially from those anticipated due to a number of factors including among others those discussed in the section entitled “item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors as such investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes in a period where the us dollar is strengtheningweakening as compared to other currencies our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at a lowerhigher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment 

we use operational and economic hedges as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows in order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations we enter into derivative instruments principally forward currency exchange rate contracts these contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities at inception of the contract the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge the primary currencies of the derivative instruments are the euro and japanese yen fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged such as in certain emerging markets may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility we do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at april 24 2015  and april 26 2014 was 9782 billion  and 8051 billion respectively at april 24 2015  these contracts were in an unrealized gain position of 599 million a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency exchange rate derivative contracts at april 24 2015  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthenedweakened by 10 percent against all currencies the fair value of these contracts would increasedecrease by approximately 586 million any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings we manage interest rate risk in the aggregate while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs our debt portfolio as of april 24 2015  was comprised of debt predominately denominated in us dollars our debt portfolio was comprised of approximately 90 fixed rate debt and approximately 10 floatingrate debt as of april 24 2015  we are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments which include our marketable debt securities fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates compared to interest rates as of april 24 2015  indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by 76 million
