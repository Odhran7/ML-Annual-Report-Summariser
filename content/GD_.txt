environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly 

involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change the timing and effect of which are difficult to assess 

changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including increased energy and raw materials costs environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations including costs associated with changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve each segment shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue in 2021 70 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to us budget matters see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its 

allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted many foreign contracts have similar termination rights by customers the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by corporate individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace segment’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

• the productivity and availability of labor 

• the complexity of the work to be performed 

• the cost and availability of materials and components and 

• schedule requirements 

if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and supplier performance we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and suppliers to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our 

supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon materials perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

risks relating to our international operations 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities political leadership and budgets which may be influenced by changes in threat environments geopolitical uncertainties volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems our nonus operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus operations 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

risks relating to our acquisitions and similar investment activities 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in government spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

other business and operational risks 

our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions we face various cybersecurity threats including threats to our it infrastructure and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers suppliers subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems we conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and we report cybersecurity events or losses of customer data to affected customers and applicable regulatory authorities however there can be no assurance that any such actions or the safeguards put in place by our customers suppliers subcontractors and other parties on which we rely will be sufficient to detect prevent and mitigate cybersecurity breaches or disruptions or the unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data 

we have experienced cybersecurity events and disruptions such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and loss of business challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers and impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security 

threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

our business may continue to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition effects include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and supplychain disruptions which could affect our ability to perform on our contracts in addition the us government’s federal contractor vaccine mandate could adversely affect our ability and our subcontractors’ ability to hire and retain highly skilled employees to work on us government programs any cost increases that result from these effects may not be fully recoverable on our contracts or adequately covered by insurance which could impact our profitability in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products and services the imposition of quarantine and travel restrictions has negatively affected and if reimposed may continue to negatively affect portions of our business particularly our aerospace and technologies segments the extent to which covid19 continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus including the emergence of new variants the severity of the disease vaccination rates and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located could similarly affect our business in the future 

increased regulation related to global climate change could negatively affect our business increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in state federal or international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming such as the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms or stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions if environmental or climatechange laws or regulations are adopted or changed that impose significant new costs operational restrictions or compliance requirements upon our business or our products they could increase our capital expenditures reduce our margins and adversely affect our financial position

business environment 

global pandemic update 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities since march 2020 during this time we have continued to conduct our operations while responding to the pandemic with actions to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees business supply chain and customers consistent with our prioritization of the health and safety of our employees we continue to encourage and promote vaccination across the company any longterm impact to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around the pandemic’s duration and its broader impact for additional information see the risk factors in part i item 1a 

the united states and other governments have taken several steps to respond to the pandemic on september 9 2021 the president signed executive order 14042 initiating a process whereby covered federal contractors and subcontractors must implement federally required vaccine mandates a clause implementing the federal contractor vaccine mandate has been incorporated into a number of our federal contracts in light of certain court orders however the office of management and budget has stated that the us government will not take action to enforce this clause until further notice if ultimately upheld this federal contract requirement may affect various business units differently we are working closely with our customer to ensure that we minimize disruptions and potential employee attrition in the event that applicable contract modifications are enforceable and as additional modifications are received that could trigger implementation to the extent that we or our subcontractors experience employee attrition andor work stoppages our costs could increase schedules could slip on affected programs and our ability to perform under some contracts could be negatively affected particularly in those instances where we cannot receive cost reimbursement 

our aerospace segment’s operating results have experienced the most significant impact from the pandemic new aircraft deliveries in 2021 reflected our decision in 2020 to reduce production rates to accommodate supply chain challenges and reduced demand due to the pandemic however aircraft demand has been strong in 2021 with orders reaching their highest level in over a decade similarly demand for aircraft services has improved as air travel has increased but remains below prepandemic levels in some regions of the world our us government business continues to experience some disruption from the covid19 pandemic particularly in our technologies segment the review of operating segments includes additional information on the impacts of the pandemic for the affected segments 

our markets 

with approximately 70 of our revenue from the us government government spending levels — particularly defense spending — influence our financial performance the congress has not yet passed a defense appropriations bill for the government’s fiscal year fy 2022 despite the fact that the new year began on october 1 2021 however on december 3 2021 a continuing resolution cr was signed into law providing funding for federal agencies through february 18 2022 when the government operates under a cr all programs of record are funded at the prior year’s appropriated levels and the department of defense dod is prohibited from starting new programs while this could result in delayed revenue growth as programs that were expected to have increased funding levels continue to operate at the prioryear levels until the currentyear appropriations bill is passed we do not anticipate that the current cr or any subsequent extensions will have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

international demand for military equipment and technologies presents opportunities for our nonus operations and exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant there are risks to doing business in foreign countries including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace segment we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the segment’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will be a source of steady revenue growth as the global business jet fleet continues to grow and the impact of the pandemic subsides 

other legislative activity 

in november 2021 the us house of representatives passed the build back better act bbba which provides for changes to us corporate income taxation bbba would delay until 2026 the requirement to capitalize and amortize over five years certain research and experimental expenditures beginning in 2022 that were previously deductible immediately 

we cannot determine whether some or all of the proposals that were included in bbba will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposals prior to enactment if the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and experimental expenditures were delayed via passage of bbba or other legislation it would delay the temporary increase in our tax payments otherwise beginning in 2022 that would be caused by the capitalization requirement 

results of operations 

introduction 

the following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results 

in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully 

outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the segment’s custom completions of narrowbody and widebody aircraft and the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries progress on aircraft completions and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period 

the majority of the aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace segment’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultralargecabin largecabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models a new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process additional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the segment 

in the defense segments revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts because costs are used as a measure of progress yearoveryear variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue which we generally refer to as volume 

operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete the contract or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value or vice versa that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher versus lowermargin work higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors including contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and type of work eg developmentproduction contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our longterm production contracts new longterm production contracts typically have lower margins initially and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions 

consolidated overview 

2021 in review 

• strong operating performance 

◦ revenue of 385 billion an increase of 14 from 2020 

◦ operating earnings of 42 billion with sequential growth throughout the year 

◦ diluted earnings per share of 1155 up 5 from 2020 

◦ cash provided by operating activities of 43 billion or 131 percent of net earnings 

• backlog of 876 billion supporting our longterm growth expectations 

◦ significant gulfstream aircraft order activity including orders for the recently announced g400 and g800 aircraft 



our consolidated revenue increased in 2021 driven by growth in us navy ship construction in our marine systems segment higher aircraft services activity was offset by a planned reduction in aircraft deliveries in our aerospace segment lower c5isr solutions revenue was offset partially by increased it services activity in our technologies segment and international vehicle revenue in our combat systems segment operating margin remained steady in 2021 

review of operating segments 

following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our operating segments for the aerospace segment results are analyzed by specific types of products and services consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segments the discussion is based on markets and the lines of products and services offered with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the results additional information regarding our segments can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 



operating results 

the increase in the aerospace segment’s revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



aircraft services revenue was higher in 2021 due to increased air travel driving additional demand for maintenance work and activity at our fixedbase operator fbo facilities aircraft manufacturing revenue decreased in 2021 due to fewer aircraft deliveries reflecting the full impact of our decision in 2020 to reduce aircraft production rates in response to the covid19 pandemic 

the change in the segment’s operating earnings in 2021 consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were down in 2021 due to the planned reduced aircraft production and delivery rates and marktomarket adjustments related to g500 test aircraft in 2021 aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were also impacted negatively by the settlement of claims with a supplier related to the assignment of warranties following the end of g550 production 

these decreases were offset partially by increased aircraft services operating earnings due to higher volume and a favorable mix of aircraft services the operating earnings variance also reflects restructuring actions taken in 2020 to adjust the workforce size to the revised production levels 

operating earnings in 2021 reflected higher gaother expenses due primarily to increased rd expenses associated with ongoing product development efforts including flight test activities for the g700 which is scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 in total the aerospace segment’s operating margin decreased 70 basis points in 2021 to 127 

2022 outlook 

we expect the aerospace segment’s 2022 revenue to increase to approximately 84 billion due to increased new aircraft deliveries with operating margin of approximately 128 we expect aircraft deliveries to continue to increase in 2023 and 2024 resulting in additional revenue growth of 2 billion in 2023 and 16 billion in 2024 and operating margin expansion of 200 basis points and 100 basis points respectively 

marine systems 



operating results 

the increase in the marine systems segment’s revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



revenue from us navy ship construction was up across our shipyards in 2021 due to increased volume on the columbiaclass submarine program the john lewisclass tao205 fleet replenishment oiler program and the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer program these increases were offset partially by delivery of our last commercial containership in backlog in 2020 and lower volume on the columbiaclass design contract overall the marine systems segment’s operating margin decreased 30 basis points in 2021 reflecting the shift in mix to early work on new submarine programs with typical lower initial profit rates 

2022 outlook 

we expect the marine systems segment’s 2022 revenue to be approximately 108 billion operating margin is expected to be approximately 86 as each shipyard continues to come down the learning curve on their major construction programs 

combat systems 



operating results 

the increase in the combat systems segment’s revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



revenue was up in the combat systems segment in 2021 due to higher volume on international wheeled vehicle programs including contracts to produce armored combat support vehicles acsvs and light armored vehicles lavs for the canadian government and a variety of wheeled and tactical vehicles for a number of european customers volume was also up on us stryker wheeled combat vehicles particularly in support of the maneuver shortrange air defense mshorad variant the combat systems segment’s operating margin increased 10 basis points compared with 2020 driven by favorable contract mix and strong operating performance 

2022 outlook 

we expect the combat systems segment’s 2022 revenue to be between 715 and 725 billion with operating margin of approximately 145 

technologies 



operating results 

the change in the technologies segment’s revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



 command control communications computers cyber intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance 

c5isr solutions revenue decreased due to timing on several international programs and supply chain shortages and impacts to us government acquisition cycles resulting from the covid19 pandemic the decrease in c5isr solutions revenue was also due to approximately 115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year these decreases were offset partially by increased it services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of and increased access to customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic 

the technologies segment’s operating margin increased 60 basis points compared with 2020 due to favorable contract mix and reduced covidrelated impacts in our it services business particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021 additionally operating results in 2020 included an approximate 40 loss on a contract with a nonus customer from schedule delays caused by covidrelated travel restrictions offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business 

2022 outlook 

we expect the technologies segment’s 2022 revenue to be between 128 and 13 billion with operating margin of around 10 

corporate 

corporate operating results totaled 84 in 2021 and 56 in 2020 and consisted primarily of equitybased compensation expense corporate operating costs are expected to be approximately 110 in 2022 driven by accelerated recognition of stock option expense 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 



the increase in product revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



ship construction revenue increased driven by higher us navy ship construction volume across our shipyards this increase was offset partially by lower aircraft manufacturing revenue due to fewer aircraft deliveries and revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year in 2021 the primary drivers of the changes in product operating costs were the changes in volume described above 

the increase in service revenue in 2021 consisted of the following 



services revenue increased due to higher aircraft services revenue driven by additional maintenance work and fbo activity and the ramp up of several new it services programs and higher volume on existing programs in 2021 the primary drivers of the changes in service operating costs were the changes in volume described above 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 58 in 2021 and 2020 we expect ga expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2022 to be generally consistent with 2021 

other net 

net other income was 134 in 2021 and 82 in 2020 and represents primarily the nonservice components of pension and other postretirement benefits in 2022 we expect net other income to be approximately 170 reflecting continued growth in income from the nonservice components of pension and other postretirement benefits 

interest net 

net interest expense was 424 in 2021 and 477 in 2020 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including interest rates we expect 2022 net interest expense to be approximately 380 reflecting repayment of our scheduled debt maturities in 2021 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 159 in 2021 and 153 in 2020 for further discussion including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note d to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for 2022 we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 16 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 876 billion on december 31 2021 our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 1275 billion on december 31 2021 

the following table details the backlog and estimated potential contract value of each segment at the end of 2021 and 2020 



for additional information about our major products and services in backlog see the business discussion contained in item 1 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to 

provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace segment ended 2021 with backlog of 163 billion up 40 from 116 billion at yearend 2020 

reflecting strong demand across our aircraft portfolio orders in 2021 were the highest in more than a decade the segment’s booktobill ratio orders divided by revenue was 16to1 in 2021 our december 31 2021 backlog included orders for the new g400 and g800 aircraft which are scheduled to enter service in 2025 and 2023 respectively 

beyond total backlog estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and longterm aircraft services agreements on december 31 2021 estimated potential contract value in the aerospace segment was 17 billion 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented approximately 70 of the segment’s orders in 2021 and 57 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2021 demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

the following represents gulfstream aircraft in units in backlog by region on december 31 2021 

defense segments 

the total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the us congress and funded by customers as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments the unfunded portion of total backlog includes the amounts we believe are likely to be funded but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program 

estimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq 

contracts contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order for idiq contracts we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value this amount is often less than the total idiq contract value particularly when the contract has multiple awardees the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value 

total backlog in our defense segments was 713 billion on december 31 2021 compared with 779 billion at yearend 2020 due primarily to continued performance on significant multiyear contracts in the marine systems segment the technologies segment achieved a booktobill ratio of 1to1 in 2021 estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was 382 billion on december 31 2021 compared with 424 billion at yearend 2020 

marine systems 

the marine systems segment’s backlog consists of very longterm submarine and surface ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the segment’s backlog and estimated potential contract value were down compared with yearend 2020 due to continued performance on significant multiyear contracts 

we received the following significant contract awards in the marine systems segment during 2021 

• 19 billion from the navy for the construction of a tenth submarine in block v of the virginiaclass submarine program 

• 14 billion from the navy to provide ongoing lead yard services for the virginiaclass and columbiaclass submarine programs 

• 385 from the navy for advanced nuclear plant studies anps in support of the columbiaclass submarine program 

• 355 from the navy to provide maintenance and repair services for the ddg51 destroyer san antonioclass amphibious transport dock ticonderogaclass guidedmissile cruiser whidbey islandclass dock landing ship los angelesclass submarine and nimitzclass aircraft carrier programs 

• 140 from the navy to provide ongoing planning and lead yard services for the ddg51 destroyer program 

the following represents the marine systems segment’s total estimated contract value by major program on december 31 2021 

combat systems 

the combat systems segment’s backlog consists of a mix of us and international combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions programs the vehicle programs are generally longterm franchise programs while the weapons systems and munitions programs tend to be shorterterm in nature the segment’s backlog and estimated potential contract value were down compared with yearend 2020 due to continued performance on significant multiyear contracts 

we received the following significant contract awards in the combat systems segment during 2021 

• 845 from the us army for stryker vehicle upgrades inventory management and support services 

• 665 for various munitions ordnance and missile subcomponents 

• 555 to produce piranha 5 wheeled armored vehicles and provide associated support services to the romanian armed forces

• 175 from the army for the production of hydra70 rockets 

the following represents the combat systems segment’s total estimated contract value by market on december 31 2021 

technologies 

the technologies segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders across a mix of us and nonus government and commercial customers these contracts can be shortercycle or span multiple years but commonly include a small initially funded order therefore our estimated potential contract value of 27 billion is an important indicator of future orders and revenue in 2021 approximately 60 of the segment’s orders were from additional work on idiq contracts or the exercise of options our total estimated contract value decreased slightly in 2021 driven by impacts to customer acquisition cycles resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

we received the following significant contract awards in the technologies segment during 2021 

• a contract to provide it and technical support services to the defense intelligence agency dia and the national geospatialintelligence agency nga under the solutions for the information technology enterprise site iii program the program has a maximum potential value of 126 billion among multiple awardees

• 285 from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for several contracts including work to provide cloud services and software tools 

the following represents the technologies segment’s total estimated contract value by customer on december 31 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation which is underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management this emphasis gives us the flexibility for prudent capital deployment while allowing us to step down debt over time and preserves a strong balance sheet for future opportunities 

we evaluate a variety of capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our longterm outlook and we believe agility is a key component of our capital deployment strategy as market conditions change over time our capital deployment priorities include investments in our products and services to drive longterm growth a predictable dividend strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases 

we believe cash generated by operating activities supplemented by commercial paper issuances is sufficient to satisfy our short and longterm liquidity needs an additional potential source of capital is the issuance of longterm debt in capital market transactions 

we ended 2021 with a cash and equivalents balance of 16 billion compared with 28 billion at the end of 2020 the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities in 2021 and 2020 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 43 billion in 2021 compared with 39 billion in 2020  the primary driver of cash inflows in both years was net earnings cash flows in 2021 were affected positively by an increase in customer deposits driven by gulfstream aircraft orders and the continued reduction in inventory from the sale of g500 flighttest aircraft in our aerospace segment cash flows in 2020 were affected negatively by the change in customer deposits and inventory in our aerospace segment due to our position in the development and production cycles of our gulfstream aircraft models 

investing activities 

cash used by investing activities was 882 in 2021 and 974 in 2020 our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from asset sales 

capital expenditures the primary use of cash for investing activities in both years was capital expenditures capital expenditures were 887 in 2021 and 967 in 2020 capital expenditures have been at an elevated level the past two years as we continue to invest in our shipyards particularly for the planned growth in submarine construction other capital expenditures include equipment and facility enhancements to support new and existing programs across our businesses we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 25 of revenue in 2022 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 46 billion in 2021 and 903 in 2020 financing activities include the use of cash for repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt and commercial paper repayments our financing activities also include a source of cash from proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises 

dividends on march 3 2021 our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 119 per share the 24th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 110 per share in march 2020 cash dividends paid were 13 billion in 2021 and 12 billion in 2020 

share repurchases our board of directors from time to time authorizes management to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market we paid 18 billion and 587 in 2021 and 2020 respectively to repurchase our outstanding shares on december 31 2021 121 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase representing 43 of our total shares outstanding 

debt issuances and repayments in may 2021 we issued 15 billion of fixedrate notes the proceeds together with cash on hand and commercial paper issuances were used to repay fixed and floatingrate notes totaling 25 billion that matured in may 2021 and for general corporate purposes in july 2021 we repaid an additional 500 of fixedrate notes at the scheduled maturity fixedrate notes of 1 billion mature in november 2022 and we currently plan to repay these notes using cash on hand potentially supplemented by commercial paper or other borrowings for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

on december 31 2021 we had no commercial paper outstanding but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future separately we have 5 billion in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission sec that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap financial measures 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow from operations and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 



return on invested capital we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus aftertax interest and amortization expense calculated using the 

statutory federal income tax rate average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss are calculated using the respective balances at the end of the preceding year and the respective balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented roic excludes goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



cash requirements 

the following is a discussion of how we expect to meet the future cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations 

the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years we similarly enter into longterm agreements with suppliers and subcontractors for goods and services in support of these contracts and programs with payment terms that are generally aligned with the payment terms from our customers in some instances we require advance payments or deposits from our customers which help fund our purchase commitments and reduce the risk of customer performance 

additionally we have significant liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans as these liabilities are settled using plan assets our future cash requirements associated with these liabilities are generally limited to the annual cash contributions to these plans required in accordance with internal revenue service irs regulations see note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

other obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments on our fixedrate notes and scheduled payments in accordance with our lease agreements are expected to be satisfied using cash generated from operations see notes j and k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

additional financial information 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent 

assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts our results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time 

substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses 

most of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs for longterm contracts we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 

contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 

the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims award fees and incentive fees we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award fees or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time 

as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catchup method under this method the impact of 

the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by 377 106 in 2021 and 283 078 in 2020 no adjustment on any one contract was material to the consolidated financial statements in 2021 or 2020 

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet these assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period 

longlived assets and goodwill we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment when determining the approach to be used we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions changes in the business environment and reporting unitspecific events if based on the qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then a quantitative assessment is not necessary however if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and if necessary recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value 

our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management the process requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminalvalue growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to peer companies and recent relevant market transactions 

as of december 31 2021 we completed qualitative assessments for our reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments which were performed as of december 31 2018 for the aerospace marine systems and combat systems reporting units and as of december 31 2020 for the technologies reporting unit our qualitative assessments including consideration of the impact of the covid19 pandemic did not present indicators of impairment for the reporting units 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

retirement plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates which are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions for a discussion of our assumptions and any changes to these assumptions as well as the impact of these changes which is reported as an actuarial gain or loss in the reconciliation of the change in the benefit obligation see note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the key assumption is the interest rates used to discount estimated future pension benefits we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period the effect of a 25basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption on the december 31 2021 pension benefit obligation is 509 and 536 respectively 

as described under other contract costs in note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

guarantor financial information 

the outstanding notes described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 issued by general dynamics corporation the parent are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured joint and several basis by several of the parent’s 100owned subsidiaries the guarantors the guarantee of each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor a listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this form 10k 

because the parent is a holding company its cash flow and ability to service its debt including the outstanding notes depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute cash to the parent whether by dividends loans or otherwise holders of the outstanding notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors 

under the relevant indenture the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally each 

indenture also provides that in the event 1 of a merger consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor other than a transaction with the parent or any of its subsidiaries or 2 there occurs a transfer sale or other disposition of the voting stock of a guarantor so that the guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the parent then the guarantor or the entity acquiring the assets in the event of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under the guarantee 

the following summarized financial information presents the parent and guarantors collectively the combined obligor group on a combined basis the summarized financial information of the combined obligor group excludes net investment in and earnings of subsidiaries related to interests held by the combined obligor group in subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes 

statement of earnings information 



balance sheet information 



the summarized balance sheet information presented above includes the funded status of the company’s primary qualified us government pension plans as the parent has the ultimate obligation for the plans 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of commodity price risk the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

on december 31 2021 we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of 68 billion on december 31 2020 we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of 94 billion a 10 unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax losses gains 



foreign currency risk our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro and swiss franc exchange rates these losses and gains would be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk on december 31 2021 we had 115 billion principal amount of fixedrate debt our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt 

investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years on december 31 2021 and 2020 we held 16 billion and 28 billion in cash and equivalents respectively but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and nonqualified pension plans on december 31 2021 and 2020 we held marketable securities in trust of 191 and 211 respectively these marketable securities are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

• protection of source selection and supplier information and 

• acquisition procedures 

in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts the far and cas subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

business jet aircraft 

the aerospace segment is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party 

prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal 

risks despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve each segment shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

risks relating to our business and industry 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue in 2020 approximately 70 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to us budget matters see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property 

estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by corporate individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace segment’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

• the productivity and availability of labor 

• the complexity of the work to be performed 

• the cost and availability of materials and components and 

• schedule requirements 

if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and supplier performance we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and suppliers to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon materials perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop 

manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

risks relating to our international operations 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities political leadership and budgets which may be influenced by changes in threat environments geopolitical uncertainties volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems our nonus operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus operations 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

risks relating to our acquisitions and similar investment activities 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in government spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

other business and operational risks 

our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions we face various cybersecurity threats including threats to our it infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers suppliers subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems and conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats however there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches disruptions unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data 

we have experienced cybersecurity threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and loss of business challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers and impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events 

our business may continue to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition effects include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers which can affect our ability to perform on our contracts resulting cost increases may not be fully recoverable on our contracts or adequately covered by insurance which could impact our profitability in addition the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products and services the imposition of quarantine and travel restrictions has affected and may 

continue to negatively affect portions of our business particularly our aerospace and technologies segments the extent to which covid19 continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located could similarly affect our business in the future

business environment 

global pandemic 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities our businesses have been designated as critical infrastructure by the us government and many nonus governments and as such are required to stay open during this time we have continued to conduct our operations to the fullest extent possible while responding to the pandemic with actions that include 

• implementing measures to protect the health and safety of our employees 

• modifying employee work locations and schedules where possible and permitted under our contracts 

• coordinating closely with our suppliers and customers 

• managing our cost structure in the context of current business activity 

• instituting various aspects of our business continuity programs 

• planning for and working aggressively to mitigate disruptions that may occur 

• supporting our communities and the us government in addressing the challenges of the pandemic such as the production of medical supplies and donation of personal protective equipment 

while we expect this situation to be temporary any longerterm impact to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around the pandemic’s duration and its broader impact see the risk factors in item 1a regarding the covid19 pandemic as well as additional risks facing our business which may be affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the united states and some other governments have taken steps to respond to the pandemic and to support economic activity and liquidity in the capital markets in the united states the adoption of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act provides various forms of relief the cares act includes provisions that allow agencies to reimburse contractors for payments to covered workers who are prevented from working due to covid19 facility closures or other restrictions however such reimbursement is subject to the availability of funds these provisions of the cares act have been extended through march 31 2021 the cares act also allows for loans to companies to date we have not sought or accepted cares act loans in addition the us department of defense dod increased progress payment rates and reduced retention rates on certain contracts to 

provide liquidity to federal contractors and their suppliers we in turn advanced payments across our supplier base to help maintain the health and liquidity of our supply chain outside of the united states other governments have established various government workforce programs which can support business continuity for our foreign operations we continue to assess the benefits and limitations of the actions taken by the united states and other governments see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about our use of estimates and other uncertainties 

our us government business experienced some disruption from the covid19 pandemic including reduced activities due to select customer site closures and limited access to some customer sites travel restrictions slowdowns in the provision of materials from suppliers and lower manhours at some manufacturing sites internationally while government actions shut down some of our facilities in the second quarter our defense business has largely returned to normal operations within our aerospace segment pandemicrelated travel limitations resulted in lower demand for aircraft services due to reduced flight activity and disrupted the aircraft sales process by limiting our ability to arrange demonstration flights and coordinate inperson access to customers to derisk elements of the supply chain and better align production with demand we have reduced our aircraft production rate until such time that the marketplace supports future increases accordingly we have adjusted staffing levels and taken other cost control measures the review of operating segments includes additional information on the fullyear results for each of our segments 

we expect covid19 to continue to negatively impact our businesses particularly aerospace until the large economies of the world recover from the effects of the pandemic as air travel resumes we expect aircraft services volume to increase but we could see some future aircraft deliveries delayed to the extent customers have difficulty traveling to take possession of their aircraft in addition should the global economy experience a significant extended downturn from the pandemic demand for our aerospace products and services would likely be impacted we believe the support by the dod and the us government generally of the defense industrial base has helped and will continue to help mitigate the effects of disruptions on our us defense business our nonus defense business will be impacted to varying degrees based on the response of the countries in which they operate we will continue to assess further potential consequences to our employees business supply chain and customers and take actions to mitigate adverse outcomes 

we took actions in 2020 to strengthen our liquidity and financial condition in march 2020 we issued 4 billion of fixedrate notes to repay 25 billion of fixed and floatingrate notes that matured in may 2020 and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our borrowings under our commercial paper program in addition to this longterm borrowing we renewed our access to 5 billion of credit facilities while part of our precovid19 planning this liquidity preserves our financial flexibility during the pandemic we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our short and longterm liquidity needs 

our markets 

with approximately 70 of our revenue from the us government government spending levels — particularly defense spending — influence our financial performance on december 27 2020 the fiscal year fy 2021 defense appropriations bill was signed into law it totaled 696 billion a modest increase over fy 2020 and included 627 billion in the base budget in compliance with the previously established spending caps and 69 billion for overseas contingency operations 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

international demand for military equipment and technologies presents opportunities for our nonus operations and exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant there are risks to doing business in foreign countries including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace segment we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the segment’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will be a source of steady revenue growth as the global business jet fleet continues to grow and the impact of the pandemic subsides 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results the following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results 

in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the segment’s custom completions of narrowbody and widebody aircraft and the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries progress on aircraft completions and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period 

the majority of the aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace segment’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultralargecabin largecabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models a new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process additional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the segment 

in the defense segments revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts because costs are used as a measure of progress yearoveryear variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue which we generally refer to as volume 

operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete the contract or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value or vice versa that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher versus lowermargin work higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors including contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and type of work eg developmentproduction contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our longterm production contracts new longterm production contracts typically have lower margins initially and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions 

in the discussion that follows priorperiod information has been restated for the retrospective application of a change in accounting principle related to the amortization of actuarial gains and losses for our qualified us government pension plans which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020 as discussed in note t to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

consolidated overview 

2020 in review 

• outstanding operating performance in the face of a challenging business environment 

◦ revenue of 379 billion with sequential growth throughout the year 

◦ cash from operating activities of 39 billion or 122 percent of net earnings 

• recordhigh backlog of 895 billion increased 25 billion or 29 from 2019 supporting our longterm growth expectations 

◦ several significant contract awards received in 2020 in our defense segments including 95 billion from the us navy for the construction of the first two columbiaclass submarines 



our consolidated revenue decreased in 2020 due to fewer aircraft deliveries and lower aircraft service activity in our aerospace segment also in 2020 revenue was impacted by lower information technology it services volume in our technologies segment these decreases were driven by the impact of the covid19 pandemic higher volume on the virginiaclass and columbiaclass submarine programs in our marine systems segment helped offset some of these decreases the combined revenue in our defense businesses was up approximately 300 compared with 2019 

operating margin decreased in 2020 due primarily to reduced aircraft deliveries and related restructuring charges in our aerospace segment operating margin was also negatively impacted by covidrelated disruptions in our technologies segment including a loss on a contract with a nonus customer and nonfee bearing cost reimbursements by the us government authorized under section 3610 of the cares act 

review of operating segments 

following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our operating segments for the aerospace segment results are analyzed by specific types of products and services consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segments the discussion is based on markets and the lines of products and services offered with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the results additional information regarding our segments can be found in note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 



operating results 

the change in the aerospace segment’s revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



in 2020 quarantine and travel restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on the segment’s results in an effort to derisk elements of the supply chain and better align production with demand in april we reduced our aircraft production and delivery rates for the year as a result aircraft manufacturing revenue decreased in 2020 due primarily to fewer deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 aircraft offset partially by additional deliveries of the largecabin g600 and g500 aircraft in addition decreased flight activity due to the pandemic resulted in lower demand for maintenance work and reduced volume at our fixedbase operator fbo facilities in 2020 

the change in the segment’s operating earnings in 2020 consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were down in 2020 due to reduced aircraft production and delivery rates and a somewhat less favorable mix in aircraft deliveries in 2020 operating earnings were also down in aircraft services and completions due to lower volume fullyear results were negatively impacted by restructuring actions taken to adjust the workforce size to the revised 2020 production levels these decreases were offset partially by lower net gaother expenses including reduced rd expenses overall rd expenses have been trending downward with the completion of the g500 and g600 test programs in total the aerospace segment’s operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 134 

the aerospace segment’s operating results progressively improved during 2020 following the initial disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter fourth quarter revenue grew 23 over third quarter and operating earnings grew 42 on increased deliveries of all largecabin models as well as increased aircraft services activity as a result the segment’s operating margin increased 220 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019 

2021 outlook 

we expect the aerospace segment’s 2021 revenue to be around 8 billion operating margin is expected to be approximately 125 down from 2020 as a result of fewer anticipated aircraft deliveries as the segment completed production of the g550 aircraft offset by higher anticipated aircraft services volume that carries lower margins

the increase in the marine systems segment’s revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



revenue from us navy ship construction and engineering work was up in 2020 due to increased volume on the columbiaclass submarine program revenue from us navy ship construction also increased due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine and expeditionary sea base esb auxiliary support ship programs this revenue growth was achieved as management worked to protect 

employees and support the supply chain to keep these critical programs on track during the pandemic the marine systems segment’s operating margin increased 10 basis points in 2020 despite the impact of the pandemic and a workforce strike at our bath iron works shipyard 

2021 outlook 

we expect the marine systems segment’s 2021 revenue to be approximately 103 billion operating margin is expected to be approximately 83 down from 2020 due to increased work on the first two columbiaclass submarines which carry a lower margin consistent with lead boats in a new class 

combat systems 



operating results 

the increase in the combat systems segment’s revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



revenue was up across the combat systems segment in 2020 as the business overcame disruptions caused by the pandemic in the first half of the year weapons systems and munitions revenue was up driven by increased production of artillery and missile subcomponents revenue from international military vehicles increased due to higher volume on a contract to produce armored combat support vehicles acsvs for the canadian government and the british army’s ajax armored fighting vehicle program offset partially by lower volume on piranha wheeled armored vehicle programs revenue from us military vehicles increased due primarily to higher volume on the us army’s abrams main battle tank program the combat systems segment’s operating margin increased 20 basis points compared with 2019 driven by favorable contract mix and strong operating performance 

2021 outlook 

we expect the combat systems segment’s 2021 revenue to be about 73 billion with operating margin of approximately 145 

technologies 



operating results 

the change in the technologies segment’s revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



 command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance 

it services revenue decreased due to the partial closure of some customer sites to all but mission critical personnel and a lower level of customer and program activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic it services revenue was also lower due to the exit of noncore lines of business in 2019 c4isr revenue decreased due to the sale of a satellite communications business in the second quarter and volume timing on several programs including a mobile communications network program these decreases were offset partially by increased volume on programs supporting navy platforms 

the technologies segment’s operating margin decreased 20 basis points compared with 2019 due to covidrelated disruptions in our it services business including customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee and a loss recognized on a contract with a nonus customer from schedule delays caused by covid travel restrictions the technologies segment’s operating performance steadily improved in the second half of 2020 with a reduced impact from the pandemic operating margin increased 120 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter returning to the same level of performance as fourth quarter of 2019 

2021 outlook 

we expect the technologies segment’s 2021 revenue to be approximately 132 billion with operating margin of around 95 

corporate 

corporate operating results consisted primarily of equitybased compensation expense and totaled 56 in 2020 and 54 in 2019 corporate operating costs are expected to be approximately 85 in 2021 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 



the change in product revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



in 2020 aircraft manufacturing revenue decreased due to the reduced production and delivery rates caused by the covid19 pandemic this decrease was offset partially by increased volume on the virginiaclass and columbiaclass submarine programs in 2020 product operating costs decreased at a lower rate than revenue due primarily to the mix of gulfstream aircraft deliveries 

the change in service revenue in 2020 consisted of the following 



in 2020 it services revenue decreased due to the partial closure of some customer sites to all but mission critical personnel and a lower level of customer and program activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the primary driver of the decrease in service operating costs was the change in volume of it services described above 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 58 in 2020 and 61 in 2019 we expect ga expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 to be generally consistent with 2020 

interest net 

net interest expense was 477 in 2020 and 460 in 2019 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including interest rates we expect 2021 net interest expense to be approximately 420 reflecting repayment of our scheduled debt maturities of 3 billion in 2021 

other net 

net other income was 82 in 2020 and 92 in 2019 other represents primarily the nonservice components of pension and other postretirement benefits which were income in both periods in 2021 we expect net other income to be approximately 90 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 153 in 2020 and 171 in 2019 the decrease is due to a variety of factors including higher research tax credits for further discussion including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note f to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for 2021 we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 16 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 895 billion on december 31 2020 up 29 from 869 billion at the end of 2019 our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 1347 billion on december 31 2020 up 67 from 1262 billion at the end of 2019 

the following table details the backlog and estimated potential contract value of each segment at the end of 2020 and 2019 



for additional information about our major products and services in backlog see the business discussion contained in item 1 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services beyond total backlog estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and longterm aircraft services agreements 

following reduced order activity in the first half of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic orders in the second half of 2020 reflected improved demand for gulfstream aircraft we received orders for all models of gulfstream aircraft including strong order activity for the new g700 aircraft which is scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2022 despite the impact of the covid19 pandemic the segment achieved a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenue of 09to1 in 2020 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented more than 55 of the segment’s orders in 2020 and 

41 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2020 demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

the following represents gulfstream aircraft in units in backlog by region on december 31 2020 

defense segments 

the total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the us congress and funded by customers as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments the unfunded portion of total backlog includes the amounts we believe are likely to be funded but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program 

estimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order for idiq contracts we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value this amount is often less than the total idiq contract value particularly when the contract has multiple awardees the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value 

total backlog in our defense segments was 779 billion on december 31 2020 up 58 from 736 billion at the end of 2019 driven by the award of a contract from the us navy for the construction of the first two columbiaclass submarines estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was 424 billion on december 31 2020 up 169 from 363 billion at yearend 2019 due to strong demand from customers in our combat systems and technologies segments 

marine systems 

the marine systems segment’s backlog consists of very longterm submarine and surface ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the segment’s booktobill ratio was 16to1 in 2020 resulting in backlog growth of 131 from yearend 2019 the increase in backlog is due primarily to the award of a 95 billion contract for the construction of the first two columbiaclass ballisticmissile submarines as well as associated design and engineering support other significant contract awards received in the marine systems segment during 2020 include 

• 990 from the us navy for the john lewisclass tao205 fleet replenishment oiler program including the construction of two additional ships 

• 575 from the navy to provide maintenance and repair services for the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyer independenceclass littoral combat ship lcs san antonioclass amphibious transport dock ticonderogaclass guidedmissile cruiser waspclass amphibious assault ship and whidbey islandclass dock landing ship programs 

• 310 from the navy for virginiaclass submarine construction the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest defense program in 2020 and the largest program in the company’s backlog 

the following represents the marine systems segment’s total estimated contract value by major program on december 31 2020 

combat systems 

the combat systems segment’s backlog consists of a mix of us and international combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions programs the vehicle programs are generally longterm franchise programs while the weapons systems and munitions programs tend to be shorterterm in nature the segment’s total estimated contract value at the end of 2020 was up 265 from yearend 2019 driven by awards from the us army related to abrams main battle tanks and stryker wheeled combat vehicles described below 

we received the following significant contract awards in the combat systems segment during 2020 

• 405 from the us army to upgrade abrams tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement package version 3 sepv3 configuration the contract has a maximum potential value of 43 billion 

• 320 from the army to upgrade stryker vehicles to the doublevhull a1 configuration the contract has a maximum potential value of 25 billion 

• 230 from the army to produce stryker initial maneuver shortrange air defense imshorad vehicles the contract has a maximum potential value of 12 billion 

• 215 from the army for the production of hydra70 rockets the contract has a maximum potential value of 34 billion 

• 870 to deliver 8x8 wheeled combat vehicles maintenance and lifecycle support to the spanish ministry of defense 

the following represents the combat systems segment’s total estimated contract value by market on december 31 2020 

technologies 

the technologies segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders across a mix of us and nonus government and commercial customers these contracts can be shortercycle or span multiple years but commonly include a small initially funded order therefore our estimated potential contract value of 277 billion is an important indicator of future orders and revenue in 2020 approximately 60 of the segment’s orders were from additional work on idiq contracts or the exercise of options our total estimated contract value remained stable in 2020 despite the impact of reduced new business opportunities caused by covid19 

we received the following significant contract awards in the technologies segment during 2020 

• the defense enterprise office solutions deos contract from the general services administration in partnership with the dod and defense information systems agency disa to stand up cloud environments and support the migration of over 32 million existing dod office 365 users to the cloud the contract has a maximum potential value of 44 billion 

• an idiq award from the us department of state to provide overseas consular services to support visa processing and other functions for us embassies and consultants under the global support strategy gss program the program has a maximum potential contract value of 33 billion among three awardees 

• an idiq contract to modernize the army’s training programs the contract has a maximum potential value of 885 

• a contract to provide enterprise it and cybersecurity services and solutions for the dod the contract has a maximum potential value of 760 

• a contract to provide enterprise it communications and mission command support services to us army europe the contract has a maximum potential value of 695 

• a contract from the us air force for the battlefield information collection and exploitation system bices program to provide intelligence information sharing capabilities for the dod the contract has a maximum potential value of 620 

the following represents the technologies segment’s total estimated contract value by customer on december 31 2020 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash 

generated by operating activities in 2020 and 2019 was deployed to pay dividends fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 



a debttoequity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end 

b debttocapital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end 

we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities in 2020 and 2019 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 39 billion in 2020 compared with 3 billion in 2019  the primary driver of cash inflows in both periods was net earnings however cash flows in both years were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital owc in our aerospace segment due to our position in the development and production cycles of our gulfstream aircraft models we had anticipated this owc growth to begin reversing in 2020 but the impact of covid19 on our production and delivery rates has delayed this recovery cash flows in 2019 were also affected negatively by growth in owc in our combat systems segment due to the timing of payments on a large international wheeled armored vehicle contract these payment timing issues have been resolved as a result of finalizing a contract amendment with the customer which contributed to the increase in cash flows in 2020 for additional information about the unbilled receivables balance and activity associated with this contract see note h to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

investing activities 

cash used by investing activities was 974 in 2020 and 994 in 2019 our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from asset sales 

capital expenditures the primary use of cash for investing activities in both years was capital expenditures capital expenditures were 967 in 2020 and 987 in 2019 capital expenditures have been at an elevated level the past two years as we continue to invest in our shipyards particularly for the planned growth in submarine construction we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 25 of revenue in 2021 

business acquisitions in 2020 we acquired five businesses for an aggregate of approximately 205 in 2019 we acquired three businesses for an aggregate of approximately 20 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 903 in 2020 and 2 billion in 2019 net cash from financing activities includes proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock options exercises our financing activities also include repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt repayments 

dividends on march 4 2020 our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 110 per share the 23rd consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 102 per share in march 2019 cash dividends paid were 12 billion in 2020 and 2019 

share repurchases our board of directors from time to time authorizes management to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market we paid 587 and 231 in 2020 and 2019 respectively to repurchase our outstanding shares on december 31 2020 123 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase representing 43 of our total shares outstanding 

debt and commercial paper issuances and repayments in march 2020 we issued 4 billion of fixedrate notes the proceeds were used to repay 25 billion of fixed and floatingrate notes that matured in may 2020 and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of the borrowings under our commercial paper program 

fixed and floatingrate notes totaling 25 billion mature in may 2021 and an additional 500 of fixedrate notes mature in july 2021 we currently plan to repay these notes using a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

on december 31 2020 we had no commercial paper outstanding but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future separately we have 5 billion in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap financial measures 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow from operations and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as 

repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 



return on invested capital we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss roic excludes goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



 2017 earnings from continuing operations and 2017 and 2018 average invested capital have not been restated for the retrospective application of a change in accounting principle related to the amortization of actuarial gains and losses for our qualified us government pension plans which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020 as discussed in note t to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2020 we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2020 



a includes scheduled interest payments see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 362 billion of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans see note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time 

substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses 

most of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs for longterm contracts we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 

contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 

the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and award and incentive fees we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amounts they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations 

as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly our estimates at the end of the year included impacts from the disruptions caused by covid19 given the uncertainties around the pandemic including its duration and potential future disruptions to our supply chain or workforce it is reasonably possible that the actual impact of the pandemic on contract costs could be materially different than our current estimates the united states and some other governments have taken steps to provide relief where our customer has agreed to reimburse certain costs such as provided for by the 

coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act we have included those recoveries in our estimates of revenue to the extent the us government provides for reimbursement of additional costs through legislation and the dod has available funds we will seek reimbursement as appropriate 

we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catchup method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by 283 078 in 2020 and 271 074 in 2019 no adjustment on any one contract was material to the consolidated financial statements in 2020 or 2019 

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet these assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period 

reorganization of operating segments and composition of reporting units effective december 31 2020 for segment reporting purposes we reorganized our information technology and mission systems operating segments into a single segment technologies this reorganization reflects our evolving strategic focus on the combined capabilities of the businesses to meet the customer demand for largescale endtoend highly engineered solutions our company now has four operating segments aerospace marine systems combat systems and technologies we refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments 

this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting units accordingly goodwill of the information technology and mission systems reporting units was combined and assigned to the technologies reporting unit we performed goodwill impairment assessments immediately prior to and following the change the results indicated that no impairment existed at the former information technology and mission systems reporting units prior to the change and the technologies reporting unit following the change 

longlived assets and goodwill we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities which has impacted our businesses as of the end of the year we have not identified a triggering event requiring an impairment test for our goodwill intangibles or other longlived assets in our aerospace segment which has experienced a more significant impact from the pandemic we do not believe the impact represents a longerterm change that would indicate that the carrying value of the segment’s intangibles and longlived assets may not be recoverable or that the aerospace reporting unit’s estimated fair value has been significantly affected 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment when determining the approach to be used we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions changes in the business environment and reporting unitspecific events if based on the qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then a quantitative assessment is not necessary however if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and if necessary recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value 

our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management the process requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

as of december 31 2020 we completed qualitative assessments for our aerospace marine systems and combat systems reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments which were performed as of december 31 2018 our qualitative assessments including consideration of the impact of the covid19 pandemic did not present indicators of impairment for these reporting units as of december 31 2020 we completed a quantitative assessment for our technologies reporting unit and the fair value was well in excess of its carrying value 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

retirement plans our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumption is the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period 

retirement plan assumptions including the discount rates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event any of the assumptions change pension and other postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion about our retirement plan assumptions see note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as described under other contract costs in note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

accounting standards updates see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding the accounting standard we adopted in 2020 and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not effective until after december 31 2020 

guarantor financial information 

the fixed and floatingrate notes described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 issued by general dynamics corporation the parent are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured joint and several basis by several of the parent’s 100owned subsidiaries the guarantors the guarantee of each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor a listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this form 10k 

because the parent is a holding company its cash flow and ability to service its debt including the fixed and floatingrate notes depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute cash to the parent whether by dividends loans or otherwise holders of the fixed and floatingrate notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors 

under the relevant indenture the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally each indenture also provides that in the event 1 of a merger consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor other than a transaction with the parent or any of its subsidiaries or 2 there occurs a transfer sale or other disposition of the voting stock of a guarantor so that the guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the parent then the guarantor or the entity acquiring the assets in the event of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under the guarantee 

the following summarized financial information presents the parent and guarantors collectively the combined obligor group on a combined basis the summarized financial information of the combined obligor group excludes net investment in and earnings of subsidiaries related to interests held by the combined obligor group in subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes 

statement of earnings information 



balance sheet information 



the summarized balance sheet information presented above includes the funded status of the company’s primary qualified us government pension plans as the parent has the ultimate obligation for the plans 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of 94 billion and 5 billion on december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a 10 unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gains losses 



foreign currency risk our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro and swiss franc exchange rates while the hypothetical incremental pretax losses in the table above have increased significantly from 2019 we do not believe this represents a meaningful increase in our risk profile as these losses and gains would be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed and floatingrate longterm debt obligations on december 31 2020 we had 125 billion par value of fixedrate debt and 500 of floatingrate notes our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we entered into derivative financial instruments specifically interest rate swap contracts to eliminate our floatingrate interest risk 

investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years on december 31 2020 and 2019 we held 28 billion and 902 in cash and equivalents respectively but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and nonqualified pension plans on december 31 2020 and 2019 we held marketable securities in trust of 211 and 207 respectively these marketable securities are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

the largest business unit in our marine systems segment is electric boat the lead shipyard on all navy nuclearpowered submarine programs including both the virginiaclass attack submarine and the future columbiaclass ballisticmissile submarine designed to meet diverse global mission requirements these submarines operate with highly advanced capabilities and stealth in both littoral and openocean environments 

the navy procures virginiaclass submarines in multiboat blocks currently at a twoperyear rate through a teaming arrangement between electric boat and an industry partner we have delivered 18 virginiaclass submarines from the first three blocks there are 10 boats from block iv currently under contract and scheduled for delivery through 2024 over the life of the virginiaclass submarine program we have driven delivery timelines from 88 months in block i to a current average rate of 68 months while doubling the build rate of construction to two ships per year and consistently increasing ship capability 

in 2019 the navy awarded electric boat a 222 billion contract the largest shipbuilding contract in the navy’s history for construction of the fifth block of virginiaclass submarines electric boat will serve as the prime contractor for construction of nine submarines including eight with the virginia payload module vpm and an option for a tenth submarine with the vpm that if exercised will bring the total contract value to 241 billion in addition to significant upgrades in performance the vpm included in this block is an 84foot hull section that adds four additional payload tubes more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions with the block v contract there are now 19 virginiaclass submarines in our backlog scheduled for delivery through 2029 

electric boat is the designer and builder of the navy’s columbiaclass ballisticmissile submarine a 12boat program that the navy considers its top priority these submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades and are scheduled to come online when the current ohioclass ballisticmissile submarine fleet reaches the end of its service life beginning in 2027 we are slated to begin construction of the lead boat in the fourth quarter of 2020 and deliver it to the navy in support of the ohioclass retirements in 2019 we broke ground on a 200000squarefoot assembly building in groton connecticut that is the centerpiece of a 17 billion expansion to support columbia and virginiaclass construction 

we have developed a comprehensive resource master plan to ensure that we will have a fully trained workforce in place to support the increased demand for skilled trades for both the columbia and virginiaclass programs we continue to invest in our facilities optimizing the timing between investments and returns while coordinating closely with the navy we are also working with our network of more than 3000 suppliers — mostly small businesses — to provide for concurrent production of the virginia and columbiaclass submarine programs 

bath iron works builds the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyers and manages modernization and lifecycle support for the class the navy restarted the program in 2010 after a fouryear 

break in construction bath iron works delivered the first ship in the restart program to the navy in 2017 we have a total of 11 ships in backlog scheduled for delivery through 2026 in 2019 the navy awarded bath iron works a contract to continue providing planning yard services for ddg51s to include design material kitting logistics planning and execution 

bath iron works is the hull mechanical and electrical hme prime contractor for the navy’s zumwaltclass ddg1000 guidedmissile destroyer program we delivered the first ship in 2016 and the second ship in 2018 we expect to deliver our work on the third and final ship of this class in 2020 

nassco is building expeditionary sea base esb auxiliary support ships a variant of the expeditionary transfer dock esd ships for the navy esbs serve as afloat forwardstaging bases providing a persistent platform for mine warfare special operations warfare or marine corps missions equipped with a 52000squarefoot flight deck and accommodations for up to 250 personnel these ships can support diverse missions including airborne mine countermeasures maritime security operations noncombatant evacuation operations and humanitarian assistancedisaster relief missions the navy awarded nassco the first design and build contract for the esdesb in 2011 in 2019 we delivered the fifth vessel of the program to the navy and were awarded a contract for the construction of the sixth and seventh ships as well as an option for an eighth work on the two new ships will continue into 2023 

nassco was competitively awarded an exclusive design and construction contract in 2016 for the lead ship in the navy’s new class of fleet replenishment oilers the john lewisclass tao205 along with options for five additional ships designed to transfer fuel to navy surface ships operating at sea the oilers can carry 162000 barrels of fuel and also offer significant dry cargo capacity and aviation capabilities we expect to deliver the first ship of this class the future usns john lewis in 2021 three options have been fully exercised to date as well as funding for engineering and longlead materials for the fourth option with deliveries planned into 2024 

in addition to our new construction work for the navy the marine systems segment has extensive experience in all phases of commercial ship construction we have designed and built crude oil and product tankers and container and cargo ships for commercial customers since the 1960s these ships satisfy our commercial customers’ jones act requirement that ships carrying cargo between us ports be built in us shipyards nassco is the only major jones act shipyard on the west coast of the united states nassco pioneered green ship technology designing and delivering the world’s first liquefied natural gas lngpowered containerships starting in 2015 to decrease emissions and increase fuel efficiency 

in 2019 we delivered an 870footlong 51400deadweightmetricton combination containershiprollon rolloff conro vessel — the largest conro vessel ever built in the united states — to a commercial customer the lngready ship is the first of a twoship contract 

our marine systems segment provides comprehensive ship and submarine maintenance modernization and lifecycle support services to extend the service life of these ships nassco conducts fullservice maintenance and surfaceship repair operations in navy fleet concentration areas in san diego california norfolk virginia mayport florida and bremerton washington electric boat provides submarine maintenance and modernization services in a variety of us locations and bath iron works provides lifecycle support services for navy surface ships in both us and overseas ports in support of allied navies we offer program management planning engineering and design support for submarine and surfaceship construction programs 

to promote operating efficiency innovation and affordability for our customers we make strategic investments in our business often in cooperation with the navy we leverage our design and engineering expertise across shipyards to improve program execution and generate cost savings this knowledge sharing 

enables us to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements through robust and disciplined planning we are positioned to support our customers well into the future 

revenue for the marine systems segment was 23 of our consolidated revenue in 2019  24 in 2018 and 26 in 2017  revenue by major products and services was as follows 



customers 

in 2019  66 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government 16 was from us commercial customers 9 was from nonus commercial customers and the remaining 9 was from nonus government customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the us department of defense dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community and the departments of homeland security and health and human services our revenue from the us government was as follows 



 in addition to our direct nonus sales we sell to nonus governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the nonus government customer 

our us government revenue is derived from fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials 

of our us government revenue fixedprice contracts accounted for 59 in 2019  56 in 2018 and 54 in 2017  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 35 in 2019  38 in 2018 and 42 in 2017  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 6 in 2019 and 2018 and 4 in 2017  

for information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types see note c to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenue was 62 billion in 2019  5 billion in 2018 and 45 billion in 2017  which represented 16  14 and 15 of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years the majority of this revenue is for businessjet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries 

nonus 

our revenue from nonus government and commercial customers was 74 billion in 2019  76 billion in 2018 and 75 billion in 2017  which represented 18  21 and 24 of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years 

we conduct business with customers around the world our nonus defense subsidiaries maintain longterm relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers providing a broad portfolio of products and services 

our nonus commercial revenue consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from customers outside north america represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 50 of the aerospace segment’s total backlog on december 31 2019  

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the united states we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems segment competes with a large number of us and nonus businesses our information technology and mission systems segments compete with many companies from large government contracting and commercial technology companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass and columbiaclass submarine programs the operating cycle of many of our major programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense and other government contracting programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with 

these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace segment competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of quality price and timeliness while competition for each type of service varies somewhat the segment faces a number of competitors of varying sizes for each of its offerings 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our segments follows 



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations most of our aerospace segment’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense operations we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd activities investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers in accordance with government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2019  our subsidiaries had 102900 employees approximately onefifth of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 10 of total employees are due to expire in 2020  historically we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems our us government customer is a supplier on some of our programs these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments we attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 



 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts the far and cas subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace segment is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve each segment shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue in 2019 approximately 65 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to us budget matters see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by corporate individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace segment’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 



if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon materials perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities political leadership and budgets which may be influenced by changes in threat environments geopolitical uncertainties volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems our nonus operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus operations 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays additionally due 

to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in government spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions we face various cybersecurity threats including threats to our information technology it infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers vendors subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems and conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats however there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches disruptions unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data 

we have experienced cybersecurity threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and loss of business challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers and impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security threats the potential impact 

of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events

for an overview of our operating segments including a discussion of our major products and services see the business discussion contained in item 1 the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

business environment 

with approximately 65 of our revenue from the us government government spending levels particularly defense spending influence our financial performance over the past several years us defense spending has been mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca the bca establishes spending caps over a 10year period through 2021 including a sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cuts if an annual defense appropriations bill is enacted above the spending cap 

on august 2 2019 the bipartisan budget act of 2019 bba was signed into law which raised discretionary spending limits established by the bca for fiscal year fy 2020 and fy 2021 on december 20 2019 the fy 2020 defense appropriations bill was signed into law it totaled 691 billion and included 619 billion in the base budget in compliance with the bba spending caps and 72 billion for overseas contingency operations representing an increase of approximately 3 over the total fy 2019 spending level 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

international demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for our nonus operations and exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant there are risks to doing business in foreign countries including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace segment we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace segment’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will be a source of steady revenue growth as the global businessjet fleet continues to grow 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results the following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results 

in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the segment’s custom completions of narrowbody and widebody aircraft and the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries progress on aircraft completions and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period 

the majority of the aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace segment’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultralargecabin largecabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models a new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process additional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the segment 

in the defense segments revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts because costs are used as a measure of progress yearoveryear variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue which we generally refer to as volume 

operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete the contract or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value or vice versa that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher versus lowermargin work higher or lower margins can result from a 

number of factors including contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and type of work eg developmentproduction contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our longterm production contracts new longterm production contracts typically have lower margins initially and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions 

consolidated overview 

2019 in review 

 

our consolidated revenue increased 87 in 2019 driven by deliveries of the new g500 and g600 aircraft in our aerospace segment and new contracts from the us government for military vehicles in our combat systems segment and submarines in our marine systems segment 

operating margin decreased in 2019 due primarily to the transition from mature products and contracts to newer ones which typically have lower initial margins 

review of operating segments 

following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our operating segments for the aerospace segment results are analyzed by specific types of products and services consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segments the discussion is based on markets and the lines of products and services offered with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the results additional information regarding our segments can be found in note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 



operating results 

the increase in the aerospace segment’s revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing revenue increased primarily from the initial deliveries of the new largecabin g600 aircraft which entered into service in the third quarter of 2019 and additional deliveries of the largecabin g500 aircraft which entered into service in the third quarter of 2018 the increase in aircraft services and completions revenue was driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 of hawker pacific a leading provider of aircraft services across the asiapacific region and the middle east additionally we had fifteen preowned aircraft sales in 2019 compared with seven in 2018  

the increase in the segment’s operating earnings in 2019 consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were up due to additional deliveries in 2019 driven by the introduction into service of the g600 and increased production of the g500 the growth in revenue outpaced the earnings growth due to lower margins associated with the g500 which are typical of a new aircraft model we expect the operating margins associated with both the g500 and g600 to increase over time as manufacturing learning curve improvements are achieved 

net gaother expenses were up in 2019 due to nonrecurring costs associated with a reduction in our employee workforce in the fourth quarter of 2019 related primarily to streamlining support and administrative functions this increase was offset partially by lower rd expense in 2019 which has been trending downward with the completion of the g500 and g600 aircraft test programs offset partially by increased activities associated with the development of the new g700 aircraft model in total the aerospace segment’s operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 156 

2020 outlook 

we expect the aerospace segment’s 2020 revenue to be around 10 billion with operating margin in the 157 to 158 range 

combat systems 



operating results 

the increase in the combat systems segment’s revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



revenue was up across the combat systems segment in 2019  revenue from us military vehicles increased due primarily to higher volume on the army’s abrams m1a2 system enhancement package version 3 sepv3 tank and new mobile protected firepower mpf vehicle programs weapons systems and munitions revenue was up from increased volume on several products including hydra70 rockets and other artillery for the army and missile subcomponents revenue from international military vehicles increased on higher tank program volume 

the combat systems segment’s operating margin decreased 120 basis points compared with 2018 driven by new contracts with initially lower margins in our us military vehicles business and an unfavorable settlement in the first quarter of 2019 relating to a lease at a former operating site outside the united states 

2020 outlook 

we expect the combat systems segment’s 2020 revenue to be about 73 billion with operating margin of approximately 143 

information technology 



operating results 

the increase in the information technology segment’s revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



revenue increased due to an additional quarter of csra volume as the business was acquired in the second quarter of 2018 this increase was offset partially by lower revenue in our federal civilian business as a result of the sale of the segment’s publicfacing contactcenter business in the fourth quarter of 2018 and other portfolio shaping following the csra acquisition revenue in our intelligence and homeland security business was lower due to the timing of completion of several legacy programs in 2018 versus the startup of new programs operating margin increased 10 basis points compared with 2018 due largely to acquisitionrelated synergies 

2020 outlook 

we expect the information technology segment’s 2020 revenue to be between 84 and 85 billion with operating margin of approximately 76 

mission systems 



operating results 

the increase in the mission systems segment’s revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



revenue was up across the mission systems segment in 2019 increased volume on combat and seaframe control systems for the us navy’s independencevariant littoral combat ships lcss and firecontrol systems for the navy’s submarine programs drove the increase in the naval air and electronic systems business ground systems and products revenue was up due to higher demand for computing and communications equipment the mission systems segment’s operating margin decreased slightly in 2019 due primarily to mix 

2020 outlook 

we expect the mission systems segment’s 2020 revenue to be between 5 and 51 billion with operating margin of approximately 141 

marine systems 



operating results 

the increase in the marine systems segment’s revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



revenue from us navy ship construction was up due to higher volume on block v of the virginiaclass submarine program the columbiaclass submarine program and the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer program offset somewhat by lower virginiaclass block iii volume revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services increased driven by a higher volume of surface ship repair work these increases were offset partially by lower commercial ship construction volume at our nassco shipyard 

the marine systems segment’s operating margin decreased 50 basis points in 2019 due primarily to mix shift in our submarine and auxiliary ship workloads to newer contracts with lower initial margins 

2020 outlook 

we expect the marine systems segment’s 2020 revenue to be approximately 98 billion with operating margin of around 86 

corporate 

corporate operating results consisted of the following 



corporate operating results in 2018 included onetime transactionrelated charges of approximately 45 associated with the costs to complete the csra acquisition excluding these charges corporate operating results have two primary components pension and other postretirement benefit income and stock option expense 

we are required to report the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost eg interest cost in other income expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in our defense segments pension and other postretirement benefit costs are recoverable contract costs therefore the nonservice cost components are included in the operating results of these segments but an offset is reported in corporate this amount exceeded our stock option expense in 2019 and 2018 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 



the increase in product revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



 c4isr command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions in our mission systems segment 

aircraft manufacturing revenue increased due primarily to the initial deliveries of the new largecabin g600 aircraft and additional deliveries of the largecabin g500 aircraft ship construction revenue increased due to higher volume on block v of the virginiaclass submarine program the columbiaclass submarine program and the ddg51 destroyer program offset a bit by lower commercial ship construction volume military vehicle production revenue increased due primarily to higher volume on the us army’s abrams sepv3 tank and new mpf vehicle programs c4isr products revenue was up due primarily to increased volume on combat and seaframe control systems for us navy surface ships and computing and communications equipment product operating costs increased at a higher rate than revenue due primarily to mix changes from mature programs to new production programs 

the increase in service revenue in 2019 consisted of the following 



it services revenue increased due to the csra acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 offset partially by the sale of a publicfacing contactcenter business in our information technology segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 service operating costs increased consistent with the change in volume described above 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 61 in 2019 and 62 in 2018  we expect ga expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2020 to be generally consistent with 2019  

interest net 

net interest expense was 460 in 2019 and 356 in 2018  the increase was due primarily to the impact of financing the csra acquisition including the issuance of 75 billion of fixed and floatingrate notes in the second quarter of 2018 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including interest rates we expect 2020 net interest expense to be approximately 410 reflecting our next scheduled debt maturity of 25 billion in the second quarter of 2020 

other net 

net other income was 14 in 2019 compared with expense of 16 in 2018  the 2018 expense included approximately 30 of transaction costs associated with the csra acquisition excluding these transaction costs other represents primarily the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefits which were net income items in both periods 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 171 in 2019 and 178 in 2018  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2019 is due primarily to increased rd tax credits and favorable 2019 regulatory developments associated with implementing the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform which was enacted on december 22 2017 and was generally effective in 2018 for further discussion including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note f to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for 2020  we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 175 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 869 billion on december 31 2019  up 281 from 679 billion at the end of 2018  our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 1262 billion on december 31 2019  up 221 from 1034 billion at the end of 2018 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace segment ended 2019 with backlog of 133 billion compared with 114 billion at yearend 2018  

orders in 2019 reflected strong demand across our product and services portfolio we received orders for all models of gulfstream aircraft including additional orders for the g500 g600 and g650 aircraft and strong order activity for the new g700 aircraft which is scheduled to enter service in 2022 the segment’s booktobill ratio orders divided by revenue was 123to1 in 2019 

beyond total backlog estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and longterm aircraft services agreements on december 31 2019  estimated potential contract value in the aerospace segment was 3 billion compared with 31 billion at yearend 2018 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented more than 50 of the segment’s orders in 2019 and approximately 45 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2019  demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

defense segments 

our total estimated contract value in our defense segments is comprised of the following components 



 total backlog in our defense segments was 736 billion on december 31 2019  up 303 from 565 billion at the end of 2018 driven by the award of block v of the virginiaclass submarine program from the us navy for the construction of nine submarines estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was 363 billion on december 31 2019  up 12 from 324 billion at yearend 2018  

combat systems 

the combat systems segment’s total backlog was 149 billion at the end of 2019  compared with 166 billion at yearend 2018 as the segment continued to perform on many longterm contracts awarded in prior years the segment’s backlog includes the work remaining on two significant multiyear contracts awarded in 2014 



the segment has a variety of additional international military vehicle production programs in backlog notably 

 one of the us army’s top priorities is readiness of its platform products through critical modernization efforts including upgrades for both the abrams main battle tank and stryker wheeled combatvehicle programs these initiatives generated significant order activity for the segment in 2019 

the segment received 875 of orders for abrams main battle tank modernization upgrade and sustainment programs for the us army and us partners in 2019  ending the year with backlog of 23 billion for the army backlog included 14 billion to produce m1a2 sepv3 tanks deliver m1a2 sep components and provide associated program support and 260 to design and develop sepv4 prototypes with upgraded sensors backlog included 475 to modernize abrams main battle tanks for us partners an additional 250 for abrams tank programs is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end 

the army’s stryker wheeled combatvehicle program represented 525 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2019  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2021 the segment received 400 of stryker orders in 2019  including awards to upgrade vehicles with integrated shortrange air defense capabilities and provide support and engineering services 

the backlog at year end also included 185 to develop and deliver 12 prototype vehicles for the mobile protected firepower mpf program which will increase the firepower for the army’s infantry brigade combat teams ibcts 

the combat systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2019  also included 27 billion for weapons systems and munitions programs including 210 to produce hydra70 rockets for the army 

the segment’s estimated potential contract value was 43 billion on december 31 2019  up slightly from 42 billion at yearend 2018 

information technology 

the information technology segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders and approximately 1520 of its portfolio is recompeted each year the segment’s total backlog was 91 billion at the end of 2019  up 147 from 8 billion at yearend 2018  this amount does not include 19 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options on december 31 2019  an increase of 114 from yearend 2018 funding from idiq contracts and exercised options added 57 billion to the segment’s backlog in 2019 approximately 60 of the segment’s orders 

in 2019 the segment achieved a booktobill ratio of 1to1 or higher for the fifth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 

 the segment’s backlog at yearend 2019 also included the following key programs 



 mission systems 

the mission systems segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders the segment’s total backlog was 54 billion at the end of 2019  up slightly from 53 billion at yearend 2018  this amount does not include 75 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options on december 31 2019  funding of idiq contracts and exercised options added 23 billion to the segment’s backlog in 2019  over 45 of the segment’s orders 

in 2019 the segment achieved a booktobill ratio of 1to1 or higher for the fifth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 

 the segment’s backlog at yearend 2019 also included the following key programs 



marine systems   

the marine systems segment’s backlog consists of very longterm submarine and surface ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the segment’s booktobill ratio was 29to1 in 2019  resulting in backlog growth of 661 from 266 billion at yearend 2018 to 442 billion at the end of 2019  estimated potential contract value was 55 billion on december 31 2019 up 473 from 37 billion at yearend 2018 the increases in backlog and estimated potential contract value are due primarily to the award of block v of the virginiaclass submarine program 

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest defense program in 2019 and the largest program in the company’s backlog backlog for the virginiaclass submarine program increased 181 billion from yearend 2018 driven by a 222 billion contract from the navy in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the construction of nine submarines in block v of the program and spare materials the contract includes 32 billion of previouslyawarded orders for advance materials resulting in a net increase to backlog of 19 billion the contract includes an option for a tenth submarine that if exercised would bring the total contract value to 241 billion 

for the columbiaclass ballisticmissile submarine we are the designer and builder the navy considers this its toppriority program backlog on december 31 2019 included 5 billion for design and prototype development advance construction and longlead materials procurement construction of the lead boat is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020 

the marine systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2019  included construction of esb auxiliary support ships the segment has delivered five ships in the program and construction is underway on the sixth ship in 2019 the segment received a 11 billion award from the navy for the design and construction of the sixth and seventh ships and an option totaling approximately 550 for an additional ship 

on december 31 2019 the marine systems segment’s backlog included the following major ship construction programs 



complementing these ship construction programs ship and submarine maintenance repair and other services represented approximately 15 billion of the marine systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2019  including 12 billion for surfaceship repair operations 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash generated by operating activities in 2019 and 2018 was deployed to pay dividends fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 



 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities in 2019 and 2018 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 3 billion in 2019 and 31 billion in 2018  the primary driver of cash inflows in both years was net earnings however cash flows in both years were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital owc particularly the timing of payments on a large international wheeled armored vehicle contract in our combat systems segment for additional information about the growth in our unbilled receivables balance see note h to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 cash flows in 2019 were also affected negatively by net owc growth in our aerospace segment driven by our position in the development production and cash collection cycles of our gulfstream aircraft models additionally cash flows in 2018 reflected a discretionary pension plan contribution of 255 

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities was 994 in 2019 and 102 billion in 2018  our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions proceeds from asset sales and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities 

capital expenditures the primary use of cash for investing activities in 2019 was capital expenditures capital expenditures were 987 in 2019 and 690 in 2018  the increase reflects ongoing investments to support growth at our shipyards we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 25 of revenue in 2020  

business acquisitions in 2019  we acquired three businesses for an aggregate of approximately 20 in 2018  we acquired six businesses for an aggregate of 101 billion  including 97 billion for csra 

other net investing activities also include proceeds from asset sales in 2019 we completed the sale of a business in our information technology segment that was classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet on december 31 2018 in 2018  we completed the sale of three businesses in our information technology segment a commercial health products business csra operations that we were required by a government customer to dispose of to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to services provided to the customer and a publicfacing contactcenter business 

financing activities 

cash used by financing activities was 2 billion in 2019 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 51 billion in 2018  our financing activities include payment of dividends repurchases of common stock and debt and commercial paper repayments net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock options exercises 

dividends on march 6 2019 our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 102 per share the 22 nd consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 093 per share in march 2018 cash dividends paid were 12 billion in 2019 and 11 billion in 2018  

share repurchases our board of directors from time to time authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market we repurchased 11 million of our outstanding shares for 184 in 2019 and 101 million shares for 18 billion in 2018  on december 31 2019  64 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately 2 of our total shares outstanding 

debt and commercial paper issuances and repayments in 2019 we repaid 850 of commercial paper resulting in no commercial paper outstanding on december 31 2019 but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future in 2018 we issued 75 billion of fixed and floatingrate notes to finance the acquisition of csra additionally in 2018 we paid 450 to satisfy obligations under csra’s accounts receivable purchase agreement 

fixed and floatingrate notes totaling 25 billion mature in may 2020 we currently plan to repay these notes using a combination of cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates and our credit facilities see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

we have 5 billion in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances these credit facilities include a 2 billion 364 day facility expiring in march 2020  a 1 billion multiyear facility expiring in november 2020 and a 2 billion multiyear facility expiring in march 2023  we may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates our credit facilities are guaranteed by several of our 100 owned subsidiaries we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap financial measures 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow from operations and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 



return on invested capital we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss roic excludes goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2019  we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2019  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 348 billion of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period  on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time 

substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses 

the majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs for longterm contracts we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference 

between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 

contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 

the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and award and incentive fees we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amounts they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations 

as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catchup method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by 271  074  in 2019 and 345  091  in 2018  no adjustment on any one contract was material to our consolidated financial statements in 2019 or 2018  

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet these assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period 

longlived assets and goodwill we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment when determining the approach to be used we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting 

unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions changes in the business environment and reporting unitspecific events if based on the qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then a quantitative assessment is not necessary however if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary we use a twostep process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for a reporting unit by comparing its fair value to its carrying value and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss 

our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management the process requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting units’ fair values additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

as of december 31 2019 we completed qualitative assessments for our aerospace combat systems mission systems and marine systems reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments which were performed as of december 31 2018 our qualitative assessments did not present indicators of impairment for these reporting units as of december 31 2019 

as of december 31 2019 we completed a quantitative assessment for our information technology reporting unit and the results indicated that no impairment existed the information technology reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25 reflecting the size of the csra acquisition relative to the information technology reporting unit and its recent acquisition date given that the net book value of this business was recorded at its fair value at the acquisition date in 2018 the reporting unit’s carrying value by default continues to closely approximate its fair value as of december 31 2019 as the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned a material change in the fair value or carrying value could put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment for example if the synergies from the acquisition or funding in the us government budget for our contracts fall significantly below our projections the fair value of the reporting unit would be negatively impacted similarly an increase in interest rates would lower our discounted cash flows and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit we believe the projections and assumptions we used in estimating fair value are reasonable but it is possible actual experience could differ impacting our fair value estimate 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment  estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

other contract costs other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts such as a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer these costs in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment 

we determine the longterm rates of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy for 2019 we decreased the expected longterm rates of return on assets in our primary us other postretirement benefit plans by 100 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected longterm returns of our various asset classes 

these retirement plan assumptions are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event any of the assumptions change pension and other postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion about our retirement plan assumptions see note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under other contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

accounting standards updates see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2019 and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not effective until after december 31 2019  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of 5 billion and 58 billion on december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a 10 unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gains losses 



foreign currency risk our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro swiss franc and british pound exchange rates these losses and gains would be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include variablerate commercial paper and fixed and floatingrate longterm debt obligations on december 31 2019  we had 105 billion par value of fixedrate debt and 1 billion of floatingrate notes our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we entered into derivative financial instruments specifically interest rate swap contracts to eliminate our floatingrate interest risk 

investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2019  we held 902 in cash and equivalents but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans  on december 31 2019  these marketable securities totaled 207 and were reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

revenue for the marine systems segment was 24  of our consolidated revenue in 2018  and 26  in 2017  and 2016  revenue by major products and services was as follows 



customers 

in 2018  65  of our consolidated revenue was from the us government 14  was from us commercial customers 10  was from nonus commercial customers and the remaining 11  was from nonus government customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the us department of defense dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community the departments of homeland security and health and human services and firstresponder agencies our revenue from the us government was as follows 



 in addition to our direct nonus sales we sell to nonus governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the nonus government customer 

our us government revenue is derived from fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials 

of our us government revenue fixedprice contracts accounted for 56  in 2018  54  in 2017  and 53  in 2016  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 38  in 2018  42  in 2017  and 43  in 2016  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 6  in 2018 and 4 in 2017 and 2016 

for information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types see note c to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenue was 5 billion  in 2018  and 45 billion  in 2017  and 2016  this represented 14  of our consolidated revenue in 2018  and 15  in 2017  and 2016  the majority of this revenue is for businessjet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries 

nonus 

our revenue from nonus government and commercial customers was 76 billion  in 2018  75 billion  in 2017  and 74 billion  in 2016  this represented 21  of our consolidated revenue in 2018  and 24  in 2017  and 2016  

we conduct business with customers around the world our nonus defense subsidiaries maintain longterm relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers providing a broad portfolio of products and services 

our nonus commercial revenue consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from customers outside north america represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 45  of the aerospace segment’s total backlog on december 31 2018  

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the united states we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems segment competes with a large number of us and nonus businesses our information technology and mission systems segments compete with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the 

program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace segment competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in our maintenance repair and fbo businesses the segment competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in our completions business the segment competes with several service providers 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our segments follows 



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations most of our aerospace segment’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense operations we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd activities investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers in accordance with government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2018  our subsidiaries had 105600  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 5  of total employees are due to expire in 2019  historically we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems our us government customer is a supplier on some of our programs these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments we attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 



 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts the far and cas subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace segment is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and nonus defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each segment shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue  in 2018 approximately 65 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

the budget control act of 2011 bca establishes caps for defense spending over a 10year period through 2021 including a sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cuts in february 2018 the congress approved increases to the bca spending caps through fiscal year fy 2019 however the bca’s spending limits for fy 2020 and fy 2021 have not been increased or otherwise modified the president’s defense budget estimates for fy 2020 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the bca as a result continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the bca is repealed or significantly modified 

while it is impossible to predict the exact impact on our programs or financial outlook in light of the inherent uncertainty attendant to the sequestration process the magnitude of potential funding reductions 

imposed by the sequester mechanism as written could in the aggregate have material adverse operational and financial consequences depending on how the cuts are allocated across the budget 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government  numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by corporate 

individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace segment’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon materials perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities political leadership and budgets which may be influenced by changes in threat environments geopolitical uncertainties volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our nonus operations are subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus operations 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired   goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination  goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50 such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions  we face various cyber security threats including threats to our information technology it infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as 

threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers vendors subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats however there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches disruptions unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data 

we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and loss of business challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers and impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events

business environment 

with approximately 65 of our revenue from the us government government spending levels particularly defense spending influence our financial performance over the past several years us defense spending has been mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca the bca establishes spending caps over a 10year period through 2021 including a sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cuts if an annual defense appropriations bill is enacted above the spending cap 

on february 9 2018 the congress approved increases to the bca spending caps and a budget for fiscal year fy 2019 on september 28 2018 the fy 2019 defense appropriations bill was signed into law it totaled 671 billion and included 602 billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified bca spending caps and 69 billion for overseas contingency operations however as of the filing of this form 10k on february 13 2019 seven other appropriations bills funding multiple federal civilian agencies have not been enacted these federal agencies had been operating since the beginning of the government’s fiscal year under a series of continuing resolutions crs which funded the agencies at fy 2018 spending levels the last in this series of crs expired on december 21 2018 resulting in a partial government shutdown for these agencies on january 25 2019 a new cr was approved providing funding for these federal agencies through february 15 2019 

our greatest concentration of work for the impacted agencies is in our information technology segment where this work represents less than 5 of the segment’s revenue additionally our aerospace segment was affected by the shutdown of the us federal aviation administration faa which impacted the type certification process for the new g600 aircraft the partial government shutdown did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows and we do not anticipate that the current cr or subsequent extensions will have a material impact however if another partial government shutdown occurred the longer the shutdown continued the risk of a material impact would increase 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

international demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for our nonus operations and exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant there are risks to doing business in foreign countries including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace segment we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace segment’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will be a strong source of revenue as the global businessjet fleet continues to grow 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results the following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers 

in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft  revenue associated with the segment’s custom completions of narrowbody and widebody aircraft and the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries progress on aircraft completions and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period 

the majority of the aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace segment’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultralargecabin largecabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries additional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the segment 

in the defense segments revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses  variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts because costs are used as a measure of progress yearoveryear variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue which we generally refer to as volume 

operating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete the contract or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher versus lowermargin work higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors 

including contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 



2018  in review 

 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



our consolidated revenue increased 169 in 2018  the largest driver of the increase was the acquisition of csra in our information technology segment excluding csra revenue increased by 5 driven by growth in all of our segments 

operating costs and expenses increased in 2018 due primarily to the csra acquisition including the impact of intangible asset amortization expense and onetime transactionrelated charges associated with costs to complete the acquisition resulting in a lower margin compared with 2017 the 2018 operating margin was also impacted by a less favorable aircraft delivery mix in our aerospace segment consistent with our expectation as we transition to the new g500 and g600 aircraft 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



we realized topline growth in 2017  driven by higher volume across our combat systems segment and increased revenue from aircraft deliveries and aircraft services in our aerospace segment these increases were offset partially by lower revenue in our mission systems segment driven by funding delays caused by the extended fy 2017 cr while revenue increased operating costs and expenses decreased resulting in a 131 increase in operating earnings and margin growth of 140 basis points operating earnings and margin grew at each of our segments in 2017  

review of operating segments 



following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our operating segments for the aerospace segment results are analyzed by specific types of products and services consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segments the discussion is based on the lines of products and services offered with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the results additional information regarding our segments can be found in note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



the increase in the aerospace segment’s revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



aircraft services revenue increased due to higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 of hawker pacific a leading provider of integrated aviation solutions across asia pacific and the middle east additionally we had seven preowned aircraft sales in 2018  compared 

with five in 2017  these increases were offset partially by a lower volume of custom completions of narrowbody and widebody aircraft 

the change in the segment’s operating earnings in 2018  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing and completions operating earnings were down due to a shift in the mix of gulfstream aircraft deliveries and the typical lower margin associated with the initial units of a new aircraft model as well as a performance challenge in the widebody aircraft custom completions business aircraft services operating earnings were particularly strong due to favorable cost performance and the mix of services provided in addition operating earnings were impacted favorably by lower gaother expenses including reduced rd expenses as we completed the g500 development and certification program overall the aerospace segment’s operating margin decreased 180  basis points to 176 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the aerospace segment’s revenue increased in 2017  due primarily to additional deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 and midcabin g280 aircraft offset partially by a decrease in the number of g450 and g550 largecabin aircraft deliveries aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of a fixed base operation fbo in 2017 

operating earnings increased in 2017  due to favorable cost performance and the mix of ultralarge and largecabin aircraft deliveries gaother expenses were higher in 2017  due primarily to increased rd expenses associated with productdevelopment efforts as the segment progressed with the certification of the g500 and g600 aircraft overall the aerospace segment’s operating margin increased 160 basis points to 194 

2019  outlook 

we expect the aerospace segment’s 2019  revenue to be around 97 billion operating margin is expected to be approximately 155 down from 2018  as a result of mix shift as the segment continues its transition to the new g500 and g600 aircraft as well as higher anticipated preowned aircraft sales which typically carry no margin 

combat systems 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



the increase in the combat systems segment’s revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



revenue was up across all areas of the combat systems segment in 2018  revenue from us military vehicles increased due to higher volume on the army’s abrams tank programs including work to produce abrams m1a2 system enhancement package version 3 sepv3 tanks offset partially by lower volume on stryker wheeled combatvehicle programs as we completed delivery of the stryker 30millimeter cannon upgrade vehicles revenue from international military vehicles increased due to the production ramp up of piranha wheeled armored vehicles offset partially by lower revenue on a large contract to produce wheeled armored vehicles for an international customer weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due primarily to increased production of several products including mediumcaliber and tank ammunition programs 

the combat systems segment’s operating margin decreased 40 basis points compared with 2017  driven by contract mix in our combat vehicles business 

review of 2017   vs 2016 



the combat systems segment’s revenue increased in 2017  due primarily to higher volume on the us army’s abrams and stryker programs additionally revenue was up due to increased production of several products including bombs and hydra70 rockets for the us government revenue from international military vehicles increased due to the ramp up in production on the british ajax armoured fighting vehicle program and several international light armored vehicle lav programs offset largely by lower revenue on a large contract to produce wheeled armored vehicles for an international customer as the segment transitioned from engineering to production 

the combat systems segment’s operating margin increased 80 basis points in 2017  driven by improved operating performance across the segment’s portfolio operating earnings in 2016 included the impact of a loss on the design and development phase of the british ajax armoured fighting vehicle program 

2019  outlook 

we expect the combat systems segment’s 2019 revenue to be between 65 and 66 billion with operating earnings of 965 to 975 

information technology 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



the information technology segment’s revenue increased due primarily to the csra acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 operating margin decreased 110 basis points compared with 2017 due to intangible asset amortization expense from the csra acquisition excluding the impact of this amortization the segment’s margin would have been 96 reflecting the favorable impact of csra’s mix of highermargin fixedprice work in the fourth quarter of 2018 we sold the information technology segment’s contactcenter business which had a small unfavorable impact on revenue 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



revenue in the information technology segment was essentially flat in 2017  as delays in procurement activities across a number of programs particularly in our federal civilian business offset growth in the segment’s intelligence business and the acquisition in late 2017 of a provider of missioncritical support services 

despite the lower revenue operating earnings increased and operating margin expanded 80 basis points the margin growth was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio 

2019  outlook 

we expect the information technology segment’s 2019  revenue to be approximately 83 billion a slight increase from 2018  reflecting a full year of csra’s results offset partially by divestiture activities we expect the segment’s operating margin to be around 75 

mission systems 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



the increase in the mission systems segment’s revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



revenue was up across the mission systems segment in 2018 revenue from space intelligence and cyber systems increased due primarily to demand for our portfolio of encryption products the growth in ground systems and products revenue was driven by increased activity on us army mobile communications networking programs and the ramp up of a program to design and develop the nextgeneration tactical communication and information system for the united kingdom revenue from naval air and electronic systems increased due primarily to higher volume on our us navy program for combat and seaframe control systems on independencevariant littoral combat ships 

the mission systems segment’s operating margin decreased 30 basis points in 2018 due to variations in program performance and mix 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the mission systems segment’s revenue decreased in 2017 as a result of funding delays across a number of programs including the us army’s mobile communications network and computing and communications equipment programs caused by the sevenmonth fy 2017 cr 

despite the lower revenue operating earnings increased and operating margin expanded 150 basis points the margin growth was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix 

2019  outlook 

we expect the mission systems segment’s 2019  revenue to be between 48 and 49 billion an increase of between 2 and 3 over 2018  with operating margin in the mid to high13 range 

marine systems 

review of 2018   vs   2017 



the increase in the marine systems segment’s revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



revenue from us navy ship construction increased with higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer program and john lewis class tao205 fleet replenishment oiler contract offset partially by lower volume on the navy’s expeditionary sea base esb program commercial ship construction revenue increased as work ramped up on a contract for two container ships revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services decreased driven by a lower volume of submarine repair work and the timing of surface ship repair work offset partially by increased work on the columbiaclass submarine development program and virginiaclass submarine design enhancements 

the marine systems segment’s operating margin increased 40 basis points in 2018 reflecting solid operating performance across all of our shipyards 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



revenue in 2017 was down from jones act commercial construction following the delivery of six ships in 2016 and two ships in 2017 additionally revenue decreased due to timing on the virginiaclass submarine program offset partially by higher volume on the esb program these decreases were offset partially by additional work related to the columbiaclass submarine development program and virginiaclass submarine design enhancements and a highervolume of submarine repair work 

operating margin increased 120 basis points due primarily to the 2016 impact of cost growth associated with the restart of the navy’s ddg51 program the segment’s operating margin in 2017 was also affected favorably by a decrease in lowermargin commercial ship work 

2019  outlook 

we expect the marine systems segment’s 2019 revenue to be approximately 9 billion an increase of 6 from 2018 operating margin is expected to be around 85 

corporate 

corporate operating results consisted of the following 



corporate operating results in 2018  included onetime transactionrelated charges of approximately 45  associated with the costs to complete the csra acquisition excluding these charges corporate operating results have two primary components pension and other postretirement benefit income and stock option expense 

as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 corporate operating results are impacted by accounting standards update asu 201707 asu 201707 requires the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost eg interest cost to be reported in other income expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in our defense segments pension and other postretirement benefit costs are allocable contract costs for these segments we report the offset for the nonservice cost components in corporate operating results this amount exceeded our stock option expense in 2018 and 2017 

we expect corporate operating costs of approximately 20 in 2019  reflecting projected stock option expense in excess of the projected offset of nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost for our defense segments 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 

review of 2018  vs 2017 



the increase in product revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



ship construction revenue increased due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program the ddg51 destroyer program the tao205 fleet replenishment oiler contract and commercial container ship construction military vehicle production revenue increased due to higher volume on the us army’s 

abrams tank programs and the ramp up of production on piranha vehicles for international customers the primary drivers of the increase in product operating costs were the changes in volume on the programs described above 

the increase in service revenue in 2018  consisted of the following 



it services revenue increased due primarily to the csra acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 the aircraft services revenue increase was due to higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of hawker pacific in the second quarter of 2018 service operating costs increased at a higher rate than revenue due primarily to intangible asset amortization expense from the csra acquisition 

review of 2017  vs 2016   



the increase in product revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



 c4isr command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions in our mission systems segment 

military vehicle production revenue increased due to higher volume on the us army’s abrams and stryker programs and the ramp up in production on the ajax program and several international lav contracts aircraft manufacturing and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 and midcabin g280 aircraft these increases were offset largely by decreased ship construction revenue driven by timing on the virginiaclass submarine program and reduced jones act commercial ship construction volume and decreased revenue from c4isr products driven by funding delays caused by the extended fy 2017 cr 

while product revenue was steady in 2017 product operating costs decreased due to strong operating performance in our aerospace and mission systems segments and the impact of ddg51 program cost growth in 2016 in our marine systems segment 

the increase in service revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



revenue from ship engineering repair and other services increased due to additional work related to the columbiaclass submarine development program and virginiaclass submarine design enhancements and a higher volume of submarine repair work aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an fbo in 2017  

service operating costs increased in 2017 at a lower rate than revenue due primarily to strong operating performance in our information technology segment 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 62  in 2018  65  in 2017  and 63  in 2016  we expect ga expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2019  to be generally consistent with 2018  

interest net 

net interest expense was 356  in 2018  103  in 2017  and 91  in 2016  the increase in 2018  was due primarily to the impact of financing the csra acquisition including the issuance of 75 billion  of fixed and floatingrate notes in the second quarter of 2018 the increase in 2017 was due primarily to a 500 net increase in longterm debt beginning in the third quarter of 2016 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including interest rates we expect 2019 net interest expense to be approximately 430 an increase from 2018 reflecting a full year of financing for the csra acquisition 

other net 

net other expense was 16  in 2018  and 56  in 2017  and net other income was 3  in 2016  net other expenseincome represents primarily the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost including amounts from legacy csra plans assumed as of the acquisition date the 2018 expense also includes approximately 30 of transaction costs associated with the csra acquisition in 2019  we expect net other income to be approximately 60 due primarily to the investment income from our commercial pension plans 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 178  in 2018  286  in 2017  and 267  in 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 is due primarily to the reduction of the us corporate statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 resulting from the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform on december 22 2017 the effective tax rate in 2018 also includes the impact of tax benefits associated with equitybased compensation and a discretionary pension plan contribution the effective tax rate in 2017 included a 119 unfavorable impact or 290 basis points resulting from tax reform for further discussion including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note f to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for 2019  we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate between 18 and 185 

discontinued operations net of tax 

concurrent with the acquisition of csra we were required by a government customer to dispose of certain csra operations to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to services provided to the customer in 2018 we sold these operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the sale did not result in a gain for financial reporting purposes however the sale generated a taxable gain resulting in tax expense of 13  

in 2013 we settled litigation with the us navy related to the terminated a12 aircraft contract in the company’s former tactical military aircraft business in connection with the settlement we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at our bath maine shipyard as we progressed through the shipbuilding process we determined that the cost associated with this settlement was greater than anticipated therefore in 2016 we recognized an   84   loss net of tax to adjust the previously recognized settlement value in addition we recognized   23   of losses net of tax in 2016 related to other former operations of the company 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 679 billion  on december 31 2018  up 74 from 632 billion  at the end of 2017  our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in asc topic 606 as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 1034 billion  on december 31 2018  up 175 from 88 billion at the end of 2017 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace segment ended 2018  with backlog of 114 billion  compared with 125 billion at yearend 2017  

orders in 2018  reflected solid demand across our product and services portfolio we received orders for all models of inproduction gulfstream aircraft including additional orders for the g500 and g600 aircraft 

beyond total backlog estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and aircraft services on december 31 2018  estimated potential contract value in the aerospace segment was 31 billion  up 601 from 2 billion  at yearend 2017  this increase was due largely to a multiaircraft multiyear agreement entered into with an existing corporate customer in the fourth quarter of 2018 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented approximately 65 of the segment’s orders in 2018  and 55 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2018  demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

defense segments 

the total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the us congress and funded by customers as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments the unfunded portion includes the amounts that we believe are likely to be funded but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program 

estimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq 

contracts contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order for idiq contracts we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value this amount is often less than the total idiq contract value particularly when the contract has multiple awardees the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value 

total backlog in our defense segments was 565 billion  on december 31 2018  up 114 from 507 billion  at the end of 2017  the most significant drivers of the growth in 2018 were the csra acquisition in our information technology segment and contracts totaling 48 billion awarded by the us navy for the construction of five arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyers each of our segments achieved an organic booktobill ratio equal to or greater than 1to1 in 2018 

estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was 324 billion  on december 31 2018  up 417 from 228 billion  at yearend 2017  due in large part to the csra acquisition and a multibilliondollar idiq contract awarded by the us army for computing and communications equipment under the common hardware systems5 chs5 program 

combat systems 

the combat systems segment’s total backlog was 166 billion  at the end of 2018  compared with 176 billion  at yearend 2017  the segment’s backlog includes the work remaining on two significant multiyear contracts awarded in 2014 



the segment has a variety of additional international military vehicle production programs in backlog notably 

 one of the us army’s top priorities is readiness of its platform products through critical modernization efforts including upgrades for both the abrams main battle tank and stryker wheeled combatvehicle programs 

the segment received 14 billion of orders for abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the us army and us partners in 2018  ending the year with backlog of 27 billion for the army backlog included 15 billion to produce m1a2 sepv3 tanks deliver m1a2 sep components and provide associated program support and 300 to design and develop sepv4 prototypes with upgraded sensors backlog included 640 to modernize abrams main battle tanks for us partners an additional 395 for abrams tank programs is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end 

the army’s stryker wheeled combatvehicle program represented 820 of the segment’s backlog on december 31 2018  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2021 the segment received 1 billion of stryker orders in 2018  including awards to produce doublevhull vehicles upgrade vehicles with integrated shortrange air defense capabilities and provide support and engineering services 

the backlog at year end also included 325 to develop and deliver 12 prototype vehicles for the mobile protected firepower mpf program which will increase the firepower for the army’s infantry brigade combat teams ibcts 

the combat systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2018  also included 25 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs including 415 to produce hydra70 rockets for the army 

the segment’s estimated potential contract value was 42 billion  on december 31 2018  up 328 from 32 billion  at yearend 2017  estimated potential contract value increased in 2018  driven by unexercised options associated with 2018 awards to develop and deliver prototype vehicles for the mpf program to produce piranha vehicles for the romanian armed forces and to deliver various rounds of mediumcaliber ammunition to the us air force 

information technology 

the information technology segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders and approximately 1520 of its portfolio is recompeted each year the segment’s total backlog was 8 billion  at the end of 2018  up 1206 from 36 billion  at yearend 2017  due to the csra acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 this amount does not include 171 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options on december 31 2018  funding from idiq contracts added 42 billion to the segment’s backlog in 2018 over 50 of the segment’s orders 

in 2018 the segment achieved a booktobill ratio of 1to1 for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 

 the segment’s backlog at yearend 2018 also included the following key programs 



mission systems 

similar to the information technology segment the mission systems segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders the segment’s total backlog remained steady at 53 billion at the end of 2018  compared with yearend 2017  this amount does not include 74 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options on december 31 2018  estimated potential contract value increased 556 from yearend 2017 driven by a multibilliondollar idiq contract awarded by the us army for computing and communications equipment under the chs5 program funding of idiq contracts and options added 26 billion to the segment’s backlog in 2018  over 50 of the segment’s orders 

in 2018 the segment achieved a booktobill ratio of 1to1 or higher for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 

 the segment’s backlog at yearend 2018 also included the following key programs 



marine systems   

the marine systems segment’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and surface ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the segment’s booktobill ratio exceeded 1to1 in 2018  resulting in backlog growth of 98 from 242 billion  at yearend 2017  to 266 billion  at the end of 2018  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2018  and the largest contract in the company’s backlog the segment’s backlog at yearend 2018  included 88 billion  for 11 virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023 

navy destroyer programs represented 82 billion  of the segment’s backlog at yearend 2018  an increase of 1069 driven by contracts totaling 48 billion awarded by the navy for the construction of five ddg51 guidedmissile destroyers as of year end we had construction contracts for 11 ddg51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2027 backlog at yearend 2018  also included one ship under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery in 2020 

the marine systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2018  included 95  for construction of esb auxiliary support ships the segment has delivered four ships in the program and construction is underway on the fifth ship scheduled for delivery in 2019 during 2018 the segment received funding for longlead materials for a sixth ship 

in 2016 we were awarded a design and construction contract for the lead ship in the navy’s new class of tao205 fleet replenishment oilers along with options for five additional ships during 2018 the navy exercised the options for three additional ships backlog at yearend 2018  was 18  billion for the program and estimated potential contract value totaled 1 billion for the program 

the yearend backlog also included a contract from a commercial customer for two liquefied natural gas lngcapable jones act ships scheduled for delivery through 2020 

complementing these ship construction programs engineering services represented approximately 62 billion  of the marine systems segment’s backlog on december 31 2018  design and prototype development efforts on the columbiaclass submarine program represented 51 billion  of this amount 

yearend backlog for ship and submarine maintenance repair and other services totaled 12 billion  including 955 for surfaceship repair operations 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to pay dividends fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 



 our net debt position defined as debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities increased in 2018 due primarily to financing the csra acquisition 

we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 31 billion  in 2018  39 billion  in 2017   and   22 billion  in 2016  the primary driver of cash inflows in all three years was net earnings however cash flows in all three years were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital particularly on an international wheeled armored vehicle contract in our combat systems segment for further discussion see note h to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 additionally cash flows in 2018 reflected a discretionary pension plan contribution of 255  in 2017 and 2016 the buildup of inventory related to the new g500 and g600 aircraft programs in our aerospace segment also negatively affected operating cash flows however the 2017 growth in operating working capital was offset by lower income tax payments 

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities was 102  billion in 2018  788  in 2017  and 391  in 2016  our investing activities include cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures proceeds from asset sales and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities 

business acquisitions  the primary use of cash for investing activities in 2018 was business acquisitions in 2018  we acquired six businesses for an aggregate of 101  billion including 97 billion for csra in 2017  we acquired four  businesses for an aggregate of 399  in 2016  we acquired two  businesses for an aggregate of 58  

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 690  in 2018  428  in 2017  and 392  in 2016  capital expenditures increased in 2018 to support growth at gulfstream and our shipyards we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3 of revenue in 2019  

other net  investing activities also include proceeds from asset sales in   2018  we completed the sale of   three   businesses in our information technology segment   a commercial health products business  certain csra operations we were required by a government customer to dispose of to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to services provided to the customer  and a publicfacing contactcenter business  

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 51 billion  in 2018   compared with cash used by financing activities of 24 billion  in 2017  and 22 billion  in 2016  net cash from financing activities includes proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises our financing activities also include repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt repayments 

share repurchases  our board of directors from time to time authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market we repurchased 101 million  of our outstanding shares for 18 billion  in 2018  78 million  shares for 15 billion  in 2017  and 142 million  shares for 2 billion  in 2016  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 8  since the end of 2015  on december 31 2018  75 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately  3 of our total shares outstanding 

dividends  on march 7 2018 our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 093 per share the 21 st consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 084 per share in march 2017 and 076 per share in march 2016 cash dividends paid were 11  billion in 2018  986  in 2017  and 911  in 2016  

debt and commercial paper issuances and repayments  in 2018 we issued 75 billion of fixed and floatingrate notes to finance the acquisition of csra additionally in 2018 we paid 450 to satisfy obligations under csra’s accounts receivable purchase agreement in the third quarter of 2017 we issued 1 billion of fixedrate notes that were used to repay 900 of fixedrate notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for general corporate purposes in 2016 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued 1 billion of fixedrate notes for general corporate purposes 

we have no material repayments of longterm debt scheduled in 2019 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates 

on december 31 2018  we had 850  of commercial paper outstanding we have 5 billion  in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances these credit facilities include a 2 billion   364 day facility expiring in march 2019  a 1 billion  multiyear facility expiring in november 2020  and a 2 billion  multiyear facility expiring in march 2023  we may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates our credit facilities are guaranteed by several of our 100 owned subsidiaries we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap financial measures 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow from operations and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 



 2014 information has not been restated for asc topic 606 and is therefore not comparable to the 2018 2017 2016 and 2015 information 

return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss roic excludes goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



 2014 information has not been restated for asc topic 606 and is therefore not comparable to the 2018 2017 2016 and 2015 information 

additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2018  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2018  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 177 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period  on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years   we account for revenue in accordance with  asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  the unit of account in asc topic 606  is a performance obligation a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied   our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time 

substantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers   typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses 

the majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft in our aerospace segment   revenue on these contracts is recognized   when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs   for longterm contracts we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 

contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years   these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 

the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and award and incentive fees we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract 

modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amounts they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations 

as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly   we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catchup method   under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified   revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate   the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our  operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by 345   091  in 2018  323   069  in 2017  and 16   003  in 2016  while no adjustment on any one contract was material to our consolidated financial statements in   2018  2017  or 2016  the amount in 2016 was negatively impacted by a loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat systems segment and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy’s ddg51 program in our marine systems segment 

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year   the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet   these assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period 

csra acquisition we are required to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations as of the acquisition date including identified intangible assets the amount of purchase price paid in excess of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill the fair values are estimated in accordance with the principles of asc 820 fair value measurement which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants the fair values of the net assets acquired are determined primarily using level 3 inputs inputs that are unobservable to the marketplace participant 

the most significant of the fair value estimates is related to longlived assets specifically intangible assets subject to amortization we have valued 21 billion of acquired intangible assets in connection with the csra acquisition this amount was determined based primarily on csra’s projected cash flows the projected cash flows include various assumptions including the timing of work embedded in backlog success in securing future business profitability of work and the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 

we are in various phases of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and our estimate of these values was still preliminary on december 31 2018  therefore these provisional amounts are subject to change as we continue to evaluate information required to complete the valuations throughout the measurement period which will extend into the second quarter of 2019  

reorganization of operating segments and composition of reporting units concurrent with the acquisition of csra in april 2018 we reorganized our information systems and technology operating 

segment in accordance with the nature of the segment’s products and services into the information technology and mission systems segments 

this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting units   accordingly goodwill of the information systems and technology reporting unit was reassigned to the information technology and mission systems reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach as of the date of the reorganization 

longlived assets and goodwill we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination   we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50   such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit   the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss  the process requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in note r  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations  this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting units’ fair values additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2018  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value the results of the firststep test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed   the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value as of   december 31 2018  with the exception of our information technology reporting unit  for which the excess was slightly more than 5  this is due to the significant size of the csra acquisition relative to the newly formed information technology reporting unit and its recent acquisition date   given that the net book value of this business was recorded at its fair value during the current reporting period the reporting unit’s carrying value by default closely approximates its fair value at year end   as the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned a material change in the fair value or carrying value would put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment   for example our ability to realize synergies from the acquisition of csra and the level of funding in the us government budget 

for contracts in our portfolio are key assumptions in our projections of revenue earnings and cash flows if our actual experience in future years falls significantly below our current projections the fair value of the reporting unit could be negatively impacted   similarly an increase in interest rates would lower our discounted cash flows and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit  we believe our projections and assumptions are reasonable but it is possible they could change impacting our fair value estimate or the carrying value could change 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business  or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment  estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

other contract costs other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts such as a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid  we have elected to defer these costs in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet  until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts  we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment 

we determine the longterm rates of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in 2017 we decreased the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our primary us government and commercial pension plans by 75 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected longterm returns of our various asset classes beginning in 2019 we will decrease the expected longterm rates of return on assets in our primary us other postretirement benefit plans by 100 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected longterm returns of our various asset classes this decrease is not expected to have a material impact on our 2019 benefit costs 

these retirement plan assumptions are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions  in the event any of the assumptions change pension and other postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under other contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the  retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

accounting standards updates see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2018  and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not effective until after december 31 2018  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments  see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of   58 billion  and 43 billion  on december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively a 10  unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gains losses 



foreign currency risk our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro swiss franc and british pound exchange rates these losses and gains would be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk   our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include variablerate commercial paper and fixed and floatingrate longterm debt obligations  on december 31 2018  we had 105 billion  par value of fixedrate debt 1 billion  of floatingrate notes and 850  of commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we entered into derivative financial instruments specifically interest rate swap contracts to eliminate our floatingrate interest rate risk  

investment risk   our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to   five years  on december 31 2018  we held   963   in cash and equivalents but held   no   marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans  on december 31 2018  these marketable securities totaled   202   and were reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

our revenue from nonus government and commercial customers was 75 billion  in 2017  74 billion  in 2016  and 83 billion  in 2015  this represented 24  of our consolidated revenue in 2017  and 2016  and 26  in 2015  

we conduct business with customers around the world our nonus defense subsidiaries have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers providing a broad portfolio of products and services and maintaining longterm relationships with their customers 

our nonus commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from nonus customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 55  of the aerospace group’s total backlog on december 31 2017  

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the united states we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems group competes with a large number of us and nonus businesses our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems group has one primary 

competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in our maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in our completions business the group competes with several service providers 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd activities investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers in accordance with government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead 

charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2017  our subsidiaries had 98600  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 2  of total employees are due to expire in 2018  historically we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems our us government customer is a supplier on some of our programs these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments we attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal 

acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts the far and cas subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus revenue is subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

available information 

we file reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763117 the sec maintains a website wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information these items also can be read and copied at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 information on the operation of the public reference room is available by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 




 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and nonus defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue  in 2017 approximately 60 of our consolidated revenue was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which has occurred in recent years if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for 

our programs and timing of new awards second congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government  numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by corporate individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon materials perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities which may occur suddenly nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our nonus business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus business 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace group must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures 

we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions  we face various cyber security threats including threats to our information technology it infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers vendors subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and loss of business challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers and impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events

on february 12 2018 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of csra for 4075 per share in cash the transaction is valued at 96 billion including the assumption of 28 billion in csra debt we anticipate financing the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt financing we will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of csra common stock the tender offer is subject to customary conditions including antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of csra common stock we expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2018 the forwardlooking statements contained in item 7 do not include any estimated amounts for the csra acquisition and any associated impacts 

business environment 

with approximately 60 of our revenue from the us government our financial performance is impacted by us government spending levels particularly defense spending over the past several years us defense spending has been mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca the bca establishes spending caps over a 10year period through 2021 

on february 9 2018 the congress approved increases to the bca spending caps and a budget for fiscal years fy 2018 and 2019 the fy 2018 defense budget totals 700 billion which includes 629 billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified bca spending caps and 71 billion for overseas contingency operations representing an increase of more than 10 over fy 2017 spending levels the fy 2019 defense budget totals 716 billion however federal agencies and programs do not receive funding at the new levels until the corresponding appropriations bills are approved the congress has not yet passed the fy 2018 defense appropriation bill as a result we have been operating under a series of continuing resolutions crs which have funded government agencies at fy 2017 spending levels since the beginning of the government’s fiscal year as of the filing of this form 10k on february 12 2018 the current cr signed into law on february 9 2018 funds the government through march 23 2018 we do not anticipate that these crs will have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

international demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for our nonus operations and exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant there are risks to doing business in foreign countries including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace group we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support 

the aerospace group’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will be a strong source of revenue as the global businessjet fleet grows 

across our portfolio we focus on expanding operating earnings and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash we emphasize effective program execution and the flexibility and agility to respond to changing circumstances in our business environment and look for opportunities to drive cost reduction across our business 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results the following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our business groups we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers which we adopted on january 1 2017 priorperiod information has been restated for the adoption as further discussed in note t to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

in the aerospace group we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft  revenue associated with the group’s completions of other original equipment manufacturers’ oems aircraft and the group’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relate to new aircraft production on firm orders and consist of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of largecabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the group 

in the three defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses either as the products are produced or as services are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses  variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual 

contracts because costs are used as a measure of progress yearoveryear variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue which we generally refer to as volume 

operating earnings and margin in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete the contract or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher versus lowermargin work additionally higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 



2017  in review 

 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



our consolidated revenue increased in 2017  driven by higher volume across our combat systems group and increased revenue from aircraft deliveries and aircraft services in our aerospace group these increases 

were offset partially by lower c4isr command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions revenue in our information systems and technology group 

while revenue increased operating costs and expenses decreased resulting in an 119 increase in operating earnings and margin growth of 130 basis points operating earnings and margin expanded at each of our business groups in 2017  

review of 2016  vs 2015 



revenue was down in 2016  due to fewer g550 and g450 largecabin and g280 midcabin aircraft deliveries in our aerospace group this decrease was offset partially by higher c4isr solutions volume in our information systems and technology group operating costs and expenses decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in 2016  resulting in a 130 basispoint decrease in consolidated operating margin compared with 2015 operating margin decreased in the aerospace combat systems and marine systems groups 

review of business groups 



 corporate operating results consist primarily of stock option expense 

following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed by specific types of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the lines of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results additional information regarding our business groups can be found in note r to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the increase in the aerospace group’s revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 and midcabin g280 aircraft this growth was offset in part by a decrease in the number of g450 and g550 largecabin aircraft deliveries as we transition from the production of these models to the new g500 and g600 which are scheduled to enter into service in 2018 we also had three fewer preowned aircraft sales in 2017  compared with 2016  five versus eight aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the small acquisition of a fixedbase operation fbo in 2017 

the increase in the group’s operating earnings in 2017  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings were up due to favorable cost performance and mix of ultralarge and largecabin aircraft deliveries gaother expenses were higher in 2017  due primarily to increased rd expenses associated with ongoing productdevelopment efforts as the group progresses with the certification of the g500 and g600 overall the aerospace group’s operating margin increased 160  basis points to 196 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



the aerospace group’s revenue and operating earnings decreased in 2016  due primarily to fewer g550 and g450 largecabin and g280 midcabin aircraft deliveries operating earnings also decreased in 2016  due to a supplier settlement received in 2015 associated with aircraft component design and delivery delays partially offsetting these decreases the group’s aircraft services revenue and operating earnings increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an aircraft management and charter services provider in 2016 aircraft services operating earnings were particularly strong in 2016  due to a favorable mix of work and labor efficiencies additionally the group’s 2016 operating earnings were impacted favorably by lower gaother expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives overall the aerospace group’s operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 18 

2018  outlook 

we expect the aerospace group’s 2018  revenue to increase between 2 and 3 from 2017  operating margin is expected to be 18 down slightly from 2017  as a result of mix shift as the group transitions to the new g500 and g600 aircraft as well as higher preowned aircraft sales 

combat systems 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the increase in the combat systems group’s revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



revenue was up across the combat systems group in 2017  revenue from us military vehicles increased due to higher volume on the army’s abrams and stryker programs including work to produce abrams m1a2 system enhancement package version 3 sepv3 tanks and upgrade stryker vehicles with an integrated 30millimeter cannon and additional upgrades weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due primarily to increased production of several products including bombs and hydra70 rockets for the us government revenue from international military vehicles increased due to the ramp up in production on the british ajax armoured fighting vehicle program and several international light armored vehicle lav programs offset largely by lower revenue on a large combatvehicle contract in the middle east as the group transitions from engineering to production 

the combat systems group’s operating margin increased 80 basis points driven by improved operating performance across the group’s portfolio operating earnings in 2016  included the impact of a loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program 

review of 2016   vs 2015 



the combat systems group’s revenue decreased in 2016  due primarily to lower international military vehicles revenue driven by decreased volume on the large combatvehicle contract in the middle east and the timing of work on the group’s contract to upgrade and modernize lav iii combat vehicles for the canadian army these decreases were offset partially by higher volume on the group’s contract to deliver piranha vehicles to the danish ministry of defense 

the combat systems group’s operating margin decreased 70 basis points in 2016  due primarily to the loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program the impact of this loss was offset partially by favorable contract mix and improved operating performance 

2018  outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s 2018 revenue to increase between 3 and 4 from 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the mid to high15 range 

information systems and technology 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the change in the information systems and technology group’s revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



c4isr solutions revenue decreased as a result of funding delays across a number of programs including the warfighter information networktactical wint mobile communications network and common hardware systems4 chs4 computing and communications equipment programs caused by the sevenmonth fy 2017 cr revenue decreased slightly in our it services business due to delays in procurement activities across a number of programs particularly in our federal civilian business offset largely by the acquisition in late 2017 of a provider of missioncritical support services 

despite the lower revenue operating earnings increased and operating margin expanded 110 basis points the margin growth was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



revenue in the information systems and technology group was up in 2016  driven by higher volume across the c4isr solutions business including the wint program and several programs in canada and the united kingdom revenue decreased in our it services business driven by lower volume on our health solutions programs including less contactcenter services work for the centers for medicare  medicaid services 

the group’s operating margin increased 30 basis points in 2016  driven primarily by improved operating performance operating earnings in 2015 included a gain of 23 on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business excluding the impact of this gain on the prioryear period the group’s operating margin increased 50 basis points in 2016  

2018  outlook 

we expect the information systems and technology group’s 2018  revenue to increase between 5 and 6 from 2017  with operating margin around 11 

marine systems 

review of 2017   vs   2016 



the change in the marine systems group’s revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



revenue was down from jones act commercial ship construction following the delivery of six ships in 2016 and two ships in 2017 revenue from us navy ship construction decreased due to timing on the virginiaclass submarine program offset partially by higher volume on the navy’s expeditionary sea base esb program revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services increased in 2017  due primarily to additional work related to the columbiaclass submarine development program and virginiaclass submarine design enhancements and a higher volume of submarine repair work 

the marine systems group’s operating margin increased 120 basis points due primarily to the 2016 impact of cost growth associated with the restart of the navy’s ddg51 program the group’s operating margin was also affected favorably in 2017 by a decrease in lowermargin commercial ship work 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



revenue increased in the marine systems group in 2016  due primarily to additional development work on the columbiaclass submarine program offset partially by lower jones act commercial ship construction volume 

operating margin decreased 190 basis points in 2016  due to the ddg51 program cost growth discussed above additionally operating earnings in 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on block iii of the virginiaclass submarine program 

2018  outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s 2018 revenue to increase between 5 and 6 from 2017 operating margin is expected to be in the mid to high8 range 

corporate 

corporate costs totaled 49  in 2017  40  in 2016  and 41  in 2015  and consisted primarily of stock option expense corporate operating costs in 2018  will be impacted by the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201707 on january 1 2018 asu 201707 requires the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost eg interest cost to be reported in other income expense in the income statement in our three defense groups pension and other postretirement benefit costs are allocable contract costs for these groups we will report the adjustment for the nonservice cost components in corporate operating results this amount will offset our stock option expense resulting in expected corporate operating costs in 2018  of essentially zero for further discussion of the adoption of asu 201707 see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 

review of 2017  vs 2016 



the increase in product revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



military vehicle production revenue increased due to higher volume on the us army’s abrams and stryker programs and the ramp up in production on the ajax and several international lav programs aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 and midcabin g280 aircraft these increases were offset largely by decreased ship construction revenue driven by timing on the virginiaclass submarine program and reduced jones act commercial ship construction volume and decreased revenue from c4isr products driven by funding delays caused by the extended fy 2017 cr 

while product revenue was steady in 2017 product operating costs decreased due to strong operating performance in our aerospace and information systems and technology groups and the impact of ddg51 program cost growth in 2016 in our marine systems group 

the increase in service revenue in 2017  consisted of the following 



revenue from ship engineering repair and other services increased due primarily to additional work related to the columbiaclass submarine development program and virginiaclass submarine design enhancements and a higher volume of submarine repair work aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an fbo in 2017 

service operating costs increased in 2017  at a lower rate than revenue due primarily to strong operating performance in our information systems and technology group 

review of 2016  vs 2015   



the change in product revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



product revenue decreased due primarily to fewer g550 and g450 largecabin and g280 midcabin aircraft deliveries and decreased jones act commercial ship construction volume revenue from c4isr products increased due primarily to higher volume on the wint program product operating costs decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in 2016  due to ddg51 program cost growth in our marine systems group additionally 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on block iii of the virginiaclass submarine program in our marine systems group and a supplier settlement received in our aerospace group 

the increase in service revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



service revenue increased due primarily to additional development work on the columbiaclass submarine program service operating costs increased in 2016  consistent with the higher volume described above 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 65  in 2017  63  in 2016  and 61  in 2015  we expect ga expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2018  to be generally consistent with 2017  

interest net 

net interest expense was 103  in 2017  91  in 2016  and 83  in 2015  the increase in 2017  was due primarily to a 500 net increase in longterm debt beginning in the third quarter of 2016 we expect 2018  net interest expense to be approximately 115 the increase from 2017  is due primarily to slightly higher interest rates on the 1 billion  of fixedrate notes issued in 2017 compared with the 900  of fixedrate notes that matured in 2017 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including interest rates 

other net 

net other income was 3  in 2017  13  in 2016  and 7  in 2015  in 2018  we expect net other expense to be approximately 60 due primarily to the adoption of asu 201707 which requires the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost to be reported in other income expense in the income statement for further discussion of the adoption of asu 201707 see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 286  in 2017  267  in 2016  and 28  in 2015  the effective tax rate in 2017 includes a 119 unfavorable impact or 290 basis points resulting from the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22 2017 tax reform the primary impact of the change in tax law was the remeasurement of our us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences are realizedsettled remeasured at a rate of 21 versus 35 for the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016  was due to increased international activity as well as excess tax benefits from equitybased compensation recognized as an income tax benefit in accordance with asu 201609 we adopted asu 201609 on a prospective basis beginning in 2016 for further discussion including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note f to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

for 2018  we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 19  the expected decrease from 2017  is due primarily to the reduction of the us corporate statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 and the net impact of other tax reform provisions notably a lower tax rate on income earned from foreign sales of usproduced goods and services however the 2017 tax reform eliminated certain tax benefits under the prior tax law including the domestic production deduction further our nonus businesses which previously provided a benefit to our effective tax rate operate in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates that are now similar to the us and in some cases higher for these reasons while we continue to expect an effective tax rate slightly below the statutory rate the difference between the rates is expected to narrow under the new tax law 

discontinued operations net of tax 

in 2013 we settled litigation with the us navy related to the terminated a12 aircraft contract in the company’s former tactical military aircraft business in connection with the settlement we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at our bath maine shipyard as we progressed through the shipbuilding process we determined that the cost associated with this settlement was greater than anticipated therefore in 2016 we recognized an   84   loss net of tax to adjust the previouslyrecognized settlement value in addition we recognized a   10   loss net of tax in 2016 related to an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company 

in 2015 we completed the sale of our axle business in the combat systems group in 2016 we recognized a final adjustment of   13   to the loss on the sale of this business   

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 632 billion  at the end of 2017  up 16 from 622 billion  at the end of 2016  our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in asc topic 606 as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 88 billion  on december 31 2017  

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the group ended 2017  with backlog of 125 billion  compared with 132 billion  at yearend 2016  

orders in 2017  reflected solid demand across our product and services portfolio with especially strong orders in the fourth quarter of 2017 the booktobill ratio orders divided by revenue was onetoone for gulfstream aircraft in 2017 we received orders for all models of inproduction gulfstream aircraft as well as additional orders for the g500 and g600 aircraft 

beyond total backlog estimated potential contract value in the aerospace group was 2 billion  on december 31 2017  down slightly from 21 billion  at yearend 2016  estimated potential contract value represents primarily options to purchase new aircraft and longterm aircraft services agreements 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented 55 of the group’s orders in 2017  and approximately 45 of the group’s backlog on december 31 2017  demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

defense groups 

the total backlog in our three defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the us congress and funded by customers as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments we have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts that we believe are likely to receive funding but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program 

estimated potential contract value in our defense groups includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order for idiq contracts we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value this amount is often less than the total idiq contract value particularly when the contract has multiple awardees the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value 

total backlog in our defense groups was 507 billion  on december 31 2017  up 35 from 49 billion  at the end of 2016  driven by a 51 billion contract awarded by the us navy to complete the design and prototype development of the columbiaclass submarine estimated potential contract value was 228 billion  on december 31 2017  compared with 229 billion  at yearend 2016  

combat systems 

the combat systems group’s total backlog was 176 billion  at the end of 2017  down slightly from 178 billion  at yearend 2016  the group’s backlog includes the amount of work remaining on two significant multiyear contracts awarded in 2014 

 the group also has additional international military vehicle production contracts in backlog notably 

 the group received 19 billion of orders for abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies in 2017  ending the year with backlog of 21 billion for the army backlog included 620 to produce m1a2 sepv3 tanks deliver m1a2 sep components and provide associated program support and 365 to design and develop sepv4 prototypes with upgraded sensors  for us allies backlog included 825 to modernize abrams main battle tanks for kuwait and saudi arabia an additional 870 for abrams tank programs is included in our estimated potential contract value at yearend 

the us army’s stryker wheeled combatvehicle program represented 510 of the group’s backlog on december 31 2017  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2019 the group received 500 of stryker orders in 2017  including awards to produce doublevhull vehicles upgrade vehicles with an integrated 30millimeter cannon and provide support and engineering services 

the combat systems group’s backlog on december 31 2017  also included 26 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs including 360 to produce hydra70 rockets for the army 

the group’s estimated potential contract value was 32 billion  on december 31 2017  compared with 47 billion  at yearend 2016  estimated potential contract value decreased in 2017  due to a customerdirected restructuring of a combatvehicle contract in the middle east 

information systems and technology 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards the group’s total backlog was 89 billion  at the end of 2017  up 48 from 85 billion  at yearend 2016  this amount does not include 149 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options on december 31 2017  funding of idiq contracts and options added 46 billion  to the group’s backlog in 2017  over 50 of the group’s orders 

in 2017 the group achieved a booktobill ratio of onetoone or higher for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 

 the group’s backlog at yearend 2017  also included the following key programs 



 marine systems   

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and surface ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the group’s booktobill ratio exceeded onetoone in 2017  resulting in backlog growth of 66 from 227 billion  at yearend 2016  to 242 billion  at the end of 2017  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2017  and the largest contract in the company’s backlog the group’s backlog at yearend 2017  included 112 billion  for 13 virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023 

navy destroyer programs represented 4 billion  of the group’s backlog at yearend 2017  we have construction contracts for seven ddg51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2024 backlog at yearend 2017  also included two ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2020 respectively 

the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2017  included 245  for construction of esb auxiliary support ships the group has delivered three ships in the program and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships scheduled for delivery in early 2018 and 2019 respectively 

in 2016 we were awarded a design and construction contract   for the lead ship in the navy’s new class of fleet oilers the john lewis class tao205 along with options for five additional ships  at yearend 2017  backlog included 670  for the program and estimated potential contract value included 22 billion  for the options 

the yearend backlog also included two liquefied natural gas lngcapable jones act ships for a commercial customer scheduled for delivery through 2020 

complementing these ship construction programs engineering services represented approximately 65 billion  of the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2017  design and development efforts on the columbiaclass submarine program represented 53 billion  of this amount driven by 51 billion awarded in 2017 to complete the design and prototype development of the columbiaclass submarine an additional 12 billion is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end representing materials to be provisioned on the contract 

yearend backlog for ship and submarine maintenance repair and other services totaled 11 billion  including 780 for surfaceship repair operations 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to pay dividends fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 



 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 39 billion  in 2017  22 billion  in 2016   and   26 billion  in 2015  the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings cash flows in 2016 and 2015 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our combat systems group due to the utilization of deposits and the timing of billings on a large contract for a middle eastern customer and in our aerospace group from the buildup of inventory related to the new g500 and g600 aircraft programs and the liquidation of customer deposits associated with aircraft deliveries in 2017 the growth in operating working capital due to these factors slowed and was offset by lower income tax payments   

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities was 791  in 2017  compared with cash used for investing activities of 426  in 2016  and cash provided by investing activities of 200  in 2015  our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from asset sales 

capital expenditures  the primary use of cash for investing activities in all three years was capital expenditures capital expenditures were 428  in 2017  392  in 2016  and 569  in 2015  we expect capital expenditures of around 2  of revenue in 2018  

business acquisitions in 2017  we acquired four  businesses for an aggregate of 399  in 2016  we acquired two businesses for an aggregate of 58  we did not acquire any businesses in 2015 

marketable securities in 2015 we received 500 of proceeds from maturing heldtomaturity securities purchased in 2014 other net purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material 

other net  investing activities also include proceeds from asset sales in 2015 we completed the sale of our axle business in the combat systems group and a commercial cyber security business in our information systems and technology group 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities was 24 billion  in 2017  22 billion  in 2016  and 44 billion  in 2015  our financing activities include repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt repayments net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from debt issuances and employee stock option exercises 

share repurchases  our board of directors authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market from time to time we repurchased 78 million  of our outstanding shares for 15 billion  in 2017  142 million  shares for 2 billion  in 2016  and 228 million  shares for 32 billion  in 2015  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 11  since the end of 2014  on december 31 2017  76 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately  3 of our total shares outstanding 

dividends  on march 1 2017 our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 084  per share the 20 th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 076  per share in march 2016  and 069  per share in march 2015  cash dividends paid were 986  in 2017  911  in 2016  and 873  in 2015  

debt issuances and repayments  we issued 1 billion  of fixedrate notes in the third quarter of 2017 and we used the proceeds to repay 900  of fixedrate notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for general corporate purposes in 2016 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued 1 billion of fixedrate notes for general corporate purposes in 2015 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities 

we have no additional material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until 2021 see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates 

on december 31 2017  we had no   commercial paper outstanding but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future  we have 2 billion   in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs these credit facilities include a   1 billion   multiyear facility expiring in   july 2018  and a 1 billion   multiyear facility expiring in   november 2020  we may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates   we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the  securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets  

nongaap financial measures 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow from operations and roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 



 priorperiod information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for asc topic 606 and is therefore not comparable to the 2017 2016 and 2015 information 

return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss roic excludes goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



 priorperiod information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for asc topic 606 and is therefore not comparable to the 2017 2016 and 2015 information 

additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2017  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2017  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 171 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period  on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates  we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue the majority of our revenue is derived from longterm contracts and programs that can span several years we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic 606  the unit of account in asc topic 606 is a performance obligation a contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied   our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time 

substantially all of our revenue in the defense groups is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers   typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract costs include labor material overhead and when appropriate ga expenses 

the majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft in our aerospace group revenue on these contracts is recognized   when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft  

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs   for longterm contracts we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference 

between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 

contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years   these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 

the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and award and incentive fees we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimates are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amounts they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations 

as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts  we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catchup method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified   revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate   the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our  operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by 323   069  in 2017  16   003  in 2016  and 271   054  in 2015  while no adjustment on any one contract was material to our consolidated financial statements in   2017  2016  or 2015  the amount in 2016 was negatively impacted by a loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat systems group and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy’s ddg51 program in our marine systems group 

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year   the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable unbilled receivables contract assets and customer advances and deposits contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet   these assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period 

longlived assets and goodwill we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired   we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not  such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of 

estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations  this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting units’ fair values additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of   december 31 2017  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value   our reporting units are consistent with our business groups  the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was well in excess of its respective carrying value as of   december 31 2017  

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business  or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment  estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

other contract costs other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts such as a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid  we have elected to defer these costs in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet  until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts  we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in 2016 we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net annual benefit cost previously the cost was determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known as the spot rate approach we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflows and 

corresponding spot rates on the yield curve we accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in 2017 we decreased the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our primary us government and commercial pension plans by 75 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected longterm returns of our various asset classes 

these retirement plan assumptions are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions  in the event any of the assumptions change pension and other postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under other contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the  retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

accounting standards updates see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2017  and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not effective until after december 31 2017  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of 43 billion  on december 31 2017  and 63 billion  on december 31 2016  

in 2017 we changed our method for calculating the hypothetical incremental pretax gains losses to measure the net gains losses for each currency pair across our portfolio of forward exchange contracts eg canadian dollarus dollar rather than measure the gains losses on a contractbycontract basis the underlying portfolio and the associated exchangerate risk have not changed we restated the 2016 amount under the new method to provide comparability between 2017 and 2016 

a 10  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gains losses 



foreign currency our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro and british pound exchange rates these losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2017  we had 4 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

investment risk  our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2017  we held 3 billion  in cash and equivalents but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans  on december 31 2017  these marketable securities totaled   191   and were reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

revenue for the information systems and technology group was 29 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2016   and   2015  and 30 percent   in 2014  revenue by major products and services was as follows 



marine systems 

our marine systems group is a marketleading designer and builder of nuclearpowered submarines surface combatants and auxiliary and combatlogistics ships for the us navy and jones act ships for commercial customers with shipyards located on both us coasts we provide engineering construction and assembly work as well as maintenance and modernization support the group’s portfolio of platforms and capabilities includes 



 we have a long history as one of the primary shipbuilders for the navy constructing and delivering ships and designing and developing the nextgeneration of platforms more than 90 percent of the group’s revenue is for major navy construction engineering and lifecycle support awarded under large multiship contracts that span several years 

we are the prime contractor for the virginiaclass submarine program designed for the full range of global mission requirements including intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch these stealthy boats excel in littoral and openocean environments electric boat has delivered 13 submarines in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction we are operating currently at a two submarinesperyear construction rate the remaining 15 submarines under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023 we are also developing the virginia payload module vpm for the next block of virginiaclass submarines expected to start construction in 2019 the vpm is an 84foot hull section that will add four additional payload tubes more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and preserving the united states’ critical undersea capabilities 

the group is the prime contractor for the navy’s columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine a 12boat program that the navy calls its top priority these submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades to come when the current ohioclass fleet reaches the end of service life starting in 2027 the lead ship is slated to start construction in 2021 with delivery to the navy in 2027 in early 2017 the program achieved a major milestone with dod approval to move forward into the detailed design phase an important step to keep the program on schedule we are preparing our workforce and facilities including a new 113000squarefoot automated frame and cylinder facility in quonset point rhode island steel for the first columbiaclass hull was cut in august 2016 and 17 missile tubes are under construction to support the common missile compartment work under joint development for the us navy and the uk royal navy 

we are the lead designer and builder of the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyers managing the design modernization and lifecycle support these highly capable multimission ships provide offensive and defensive capabilities and are capable of simultaneously fighting air surface and subsurface battles they can operate independently or as part of carrier strike groups surface action groups amphibiousready groups and underway replenishment groups the navy restarted the program in 2010 and bath iron works has construction contracts for seven ddg51s scheduled for delivery through 2022 the first ship in the restart program successfully completed navy acceptance sea trials in december 2016 and is scheduled for delivery in early 2017 

bath iron works is one of the navy’s contractors involved in the development and construction of the zumwaltclass ddg1000 platform the navy’s nextgeneration guidedmissile destroyer these ships are equipped with numerous technological enhancements including a low radar profile an integrated power system and a software environment that ties together nearly every system on the ship ddg1000s will provide independent forward presence and deterrence support special operations forces and operate as an integral part of joint and combined expeditionary forces we delivered the first ship in may 2016 and the remaining deliveries are scheduled through 2020 

nassco is building expeditionary sea base esb auxiliary support ships a second variant of the original expeditionary support dock esd ships which serve as floating transfer stations that improve the navy’s ability to deliver largescale equipment and expeditionary forces to areas without adequate port access the esbs equipped with a 52000squarefoot flight deck and accommodations for up to 250 personnel are capable of supporting a variety of missions including airborne mine countermeasure maritime security operations and disaster relief missions the group has delivered the first three ships in the program 

and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

in 2016 we were awarded a sixship contract by the navy for the detailed design and construction for a new class of fleet oilers the john lewis class tao205 designed to transfer fuel to navy surface ships operating at sea the oilers will have the capacity to carry 156000 barrels of oil as well as offer a significant dry cargo capacity and aviation capability engineering and design work is underway for the first ship in the program with construction planned to begin in 2018 

our marine systems group provides comprehensive ship and submarine maintenance modernization and lifecycle support services to extend the service life and maximize the value of these ships nassco conducts fullservice maintenance and surfaceship repair operations in four primary locations within the navy’s largest us ports and at customer locations around the globe electric boat provides extensive submarine maintenance and modernization services in a variety of us locations and is converting two decommissioned submarines to moored training ships which serve as nuclear training platforms in support of allied navies the group offers program management planning engineering and design support for submarine and surfaceship construction programs 

in addition to our work for the navy the marine systems group has extensive experience in all phases of ship construction for commercial customers designing and building oil and product tankers and container and cargo ships for commercial markets since the 1970s these ships help our commercial customers satisfy the jones act requirement that ships carrying cargo between us ports be built in us shipyards the group has advanced commercial shipbuilding technology with nassco’s design and delivery of the world’s first liquefied natural gas lngpowered containerships using green ship technology to dramatically decrease emissions while increasing fuel efficiency we are also designing and producing lngconversionready ships for commercial customers and delivered six of these ships in 2016 with two more scheduled for delivery in 2017 we signed a twoship contract with a commercial customer in 2016 for the design and construction of lngcapable containerships with rollon rolloff capability with the age of the jones act fleet and environmental regulations that impose more stringent emission control limits we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities 

to further the group’s goals of operating efficiency innovation and affordability for the customer we make strategic investments in our business often in cooperation with the navy in addition the marine systems group leverages its design and engineering expertise across its shipyards to improve program execution and generate cost savings this knowledge sharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements we are wellpositioned to continue to fulfill the shipconstruction and support requirements of our customers 

revenue for the marine systems group was 26 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2016  25 percent  in 2015  and 24 percent  in 2014  revenue by major products and services was as follows 



customers 

in 2016  60 percent  of our revenue was from the us government 15 percent  was from us commercial customers 13 percent  was from nonus commercial customers and the remaining 12 percent  was from nonus government customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the us dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community the departments of homeland security and health and human services and firstresponder agencies our revenue from the us government was as follows 



 in addition to our direct nonus sales we sell to nonus governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the nonus government customer 

our us government businesses operate under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials 

in our us government business fixedprice contracts accounted for 53 percent  in 2016  54 percent  in 2015  and 53 percent  in 2014  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 43 percent  in 2016  42 percent  in 2015  and 43 percent  in 2014  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 4 percent  in each of the past three years 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages typically we assume more risk with fixedprice contracts however these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk accordingly the associated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixedprice contracts additionally some costs are unallowable under these types of contracts and the government reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates also because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs the content mix can impact margin rates 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenue was 46 billion  in 2016  and 53 billion  in 2015  and 2014  this represented approximately 15 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2016  and 17 percent  in 2015  and 2014  the majority of this revenue is for businessjet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries 

nonus 

our revenue from nonus government and commercial customers was 79 billion  in 2016  82 billion  in 2015  and 76 billion  in 2014  this represented approximately 25 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2016  26 percent  in 2015  and 25 percent  in 2014  

we conduct business with customers around the world providing a broad portfolio of products and services our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our nonus commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from nonus customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 55 percent  of the aerospace group’s total backlog on december 31 2016  

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the united states we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and nonus businesses our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems group has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global 

footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in our maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in our completions business the group competes with other oems as well as several thirdparty providers 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd investing in technologies and capabilities that provide solutions for our customers in accordance with government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent 

license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2016  our subsidiaries had 98800  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 3 percent  of total employees are due to expire in 2017  historically we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems our us government customer is a supplier on some of our programs these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs should be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus revenue is subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

available information 

we file reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763583 the sec maintains a website wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information these items also can be read and copied at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 information on the operation of the public reference room is available by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 




 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and nonus defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue  60 percent of our consolidated revenue in 2016 was from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds pressure various areas of spending decreases in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which has occurred in recent years for example changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated 

for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the us government  numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation moreover new laws regulations or standards or changes to existing ones can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities which may occur suddenly nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our nonus business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus business 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace group must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business goodwill is subject 

to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions  we face various cyber security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denialofservice attacks as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts we also design and manage information technology systems and products that contain information technology systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems in addition we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers vendors subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks by hackers targeting our information technology systems such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however future threats could among other things cause harm to our business and our reputation disrupt our operations expose us to potential liability regulatory actions and the loss of business and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers as well as impact our results of operations materially due to the evolving nature of these security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events

business environment 

with 60 percent of our revenue from the us government our financial performance is impacted by us government spending levels particularly defense spending over the past several years us defense spending has been mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca the bca establishes spending caps over a 10year period through 2021 

the fiscal year fy 2017 budget request for the department of defense dod totals 589 billion which includes 524 billion in the base budget in compliance with the bca as well as 65 billion for overseas contingency operations the budget request represents a slight increase over fy 2016 spending levels congress has not yet passed the fy 2017 defense appropriation bill and on december 10 2016 a continuing resolution cr which funds government agencies at fy 2016 spending levels was approved through april 28 2017 to prevent detrimental changes or delays to certain government programs the cr included exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for certain programs including the columbiaclass submarine program we do not anticipate that the current cr will have a material impact on our operating results in 2017 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

we continue to pursue international opportunities presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our nonus operations and through exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant these opportunities are subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace group businessjet orders reflected demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace group’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will continue to be a strong source of revenue as the global businessjet fleet grows 

in navigating the current business environment we continue to focus on improving operating earnings expanding margin and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash we emphasize effective program execution anticipate trends and react to changing circumstances in our business environment and look for opportunities to drive costreduction activities across our business 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our financial statements and operating results we recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenue and operating costs in our business groups for the periods reported in this form 10k 

in the aerospace group contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenue on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors  revenue associated with the group’s completions of other original equipment manufacturers’ oems aircraft and the group’s services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft deliveries additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the group 

in the three defense groups revenue on our longterm government contracts is recognized as the work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered as a result variations in revenue are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs yearoveryear variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor overhead and ga costs and are recognized generally as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenue 

operating earnings and margin in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts these adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the 

period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin work additionally higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 



2016  in review 

 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



operating earnings and margin increased in 2016  on essentially flat revenue compared with 2015  continuing a trend of superb operating performance our volume reflects fewer aircraft deliveries in our aerospace group offset largely by higher us navy engineering and ship construction work in our marine systems group and c4isr command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solutions volume in our information systems and technology group operating costs and expenses decreased at a greater rate than revenue resulting in positive operating leverage as a result operating margin increased 40 basis points compared with 2015  this margin expansion was attributable to improved performance and continued cost reduction efforts in the aerospace combat systems and information systems and technology groups 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



we realized topline revenue growth in 2015  driven primarily by higher ship construction and engineering activity in our marine systems group and additional deliveries of g650 aircraft in our aerospace group revenue was down slightly in our combat systems and information systems and technology groups operating costs and expenses increased less than revenue in 2015  resulting in a 70 basispoint increase in consolidated operating margin compared with 2014 operating margin improved in the aerospace combat systems and information systems and technology groups 

review of business groups 



 corporate operating results consist primarily of stock option expense 

following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed for specific types of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the lines of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results additional information regarding our business groups can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



the change in the aerospace group’s revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue decreased in 2016  due primarily to a planned reduction in green and outfitted deliveries of g550 and g450 largecabin and g280 midsize aircraft offset partially by additional deliveries of the ultralargecabin g650 aircraft aircraft services revenue increased in 2016  driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an aircraft management and charter services provider in 2016  we had one additional preowned aircraft sale in 2016  compared with 2015  eight versus seven 

the change in the group’s operating earnings in 2016  consisted of the following 



operating earnings were up slightly in 2016  compared with 2015  despite the topline decrease in revenue aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings were down due to fewer green and outfitted aircraft deliveries and the absence of a supplier settlement received in 2015  offset partially by favorable cost performance the group’s aircraft services operating earnings were particularly strong in 2016  due to a favorable mix of work and improved labor efficiencies in addition ga expenses were lower as a result of cost savings initiatives 

in 2016  the group’s operating margin increased 120  basis points to a recordhigh 205 percent  the margin expansion was driven primarily by ongoing cost savings initiatives and improved operating performance across the group 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



the aerospace group’s revenue and earnings increased in 2015  due primarily to additional deliveries of g650 aircraft operating earnings in 2015  were affected favorably by a supplier settlement associated with aircraft component design and delivery delays additionally the group’s services performance reflected a favorable mix of work partially offsetting these increases the group’s performance was impacted by slightly 

higher net rd expenses associated with ongoing productdevelopment efforts overall the aerospace group’s operating margin increased 70 basis points to 193 percent in 2015 

combat systems 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



the change in the combat systems group’s revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



the transition from engineering to production on a major combatvehicle contract in the middle east and the timing of work on the groups contract to upgrade and modernize lav iii combat vehicles for the canadian army resulted in lower revenue on our international military vehicle programs in 2016  this decrease was offset largely by higher volume on the stryker program to upgrade vehicles with a 30millimeter cannon 

translation of our international businesses’ revenue into us dollars in 2016  has been affected negatively by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations continuing a recent trend we have been experiencing in 2016  the translation impact was due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and british pound had foreign currency exchange rates in 2016  held constant from 2015  revenue in the combat systems group would have increased 15 percent over 2015  

the combat systems groups operating margin increased 70  basis points in 2016  driven by favorable contract mix and improved operating performance 

review of 2015   vs 2014 



revenue decreased in 2015  due primarily to lower revenue from us military vehicles and weapons systems and munitions in 2015  revenue from us military vehicles declined as a result of the completion of the ground combat vehicle gcv design and development program offset partially by a rampup in work on the stryker engineering change proposal ecp upgrade program weapons systems and munitions revenue decreased in 2015  due primarily to lower volume of hydra70 rockets and decreased ammunition production for us allies 

the combat systems groups operating margin increased 60 basis points in 2015  reflecting the group’s strong operating performance and cost cutting across the business including reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities completed in 2014 

information systems and technology 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



the change in the information systems and technology group’s revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



c4isr solutions revenue increased in 2016  due to higher volume across the business including the warfighter information networktactical wint mobile communications network program and several programs in canada and the united kingdom revenue decreased in 2016  in our it services business driven by lower volume on our health solutions programs including decreased contactcenter services work for the centers for medicare  medicaid services 

operating margin increased 70  basis points in 2016  this margin expansion was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across our portfolio the group also continued to benefit from the 2015 consolidation of two of our businesses to form general dynamics mission systems operating earnings in 2015  included a gain of 23 on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business excluding the impact of this gain on the prioryear period the groups operating margin increased 100 basis points in 2016  

review of 2015  vs 2014 



in 2015  revenue was down across the information systems and technology group it services revenue decreased due to lower volume on several programs including our commercial wireless work revenue decreased slightly in our c4isr solutions business due in part to lower volume on the handheld manpack and small form fit hms radio program 

despite the revenue decline the groups operating margin increased 150 basis points in 2015  driven primarily by improved program performance and rightsizing across the group including the favorable impact from the 2015 consolidation of businesses discussed previously operating earnings in 2015  also included the 23 gain on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business 

marine systems 

review of 2016   vs   2015 



the change in the marine systems group’s revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services increased in 2016  due to additional development work on the columbiaclass submarine program offset partially by lower volume for us navy repair work us navy ship construction revenue increased in 2016  due to higher volume on block iv of the virginiaclass submarine program and the expeditionary sea base esb contract as well as engineering and design work for the tao205 nextgeneration fleet oilers jones act commercial ship construction revenue decreased following the delivery of six ships in 2016  

the marine systems group’s operating margin decreased 30  basis points in 2016  driven primarily by cost growth associated with the restart of the navys ddg51 program the groups operating margin was also affected unfavorably in 2016  by lowermargin engineering services and commercial ship work 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



revenue increased across the marine systems group in 2015  us navy ship construction revenue increased due primarily to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program as we completed the rampup in construction from one to two submarines per year revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services increased due primarily to development work on the columbiaclass submarine program commercial ship construction revenue increased as work ramped up on the groups construction of jones act ships 

operating margin decreased 50 basis points in 2015  due primarily to a shift in contract mix including a gap in production on the mature esb program that was replaced by jones act commercial ship contracts and the transition from block iii to block iv of the virginiaclass submarine program the groups operating margin was also affected unfavorably by cost growth on the navys ddg1000 program and the restart of the ddg51 program 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate costs totaled 40  in 2016  41  in 2015   and 72  in 2014  the decrease in 2015 and 2016 expense is due primarily to lower compensation expense for stock options as options granted beginning in 2015 have a threeyear vesting period versus a twoyear vesting period for prior option grants see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our equity compensation plans we expect corporate operating costs in 2017  of approximately 55 the increase over 2015 and 2016 reflects normalized compensation expense for stock options following the previously described vesting period change 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 

review of 2016  vs 2015 



the change in product revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



product revenue decreased in 2016  due primarily to fewer aircraft deliveries and decreased jones act commercial ship construction volume following the delivery of six ships in 2016  revenue from c4isr products increased in 2016  due primarily to higher volume on the wint program product operating costs decreased in 2016  consistent with the lower volume on the programs described above 

the change in service revenue in 2016  consisted of the following 



service revenue increased in 2016  due primarily to additional development work on the columbiaclass submarine program service operating costs increased in 2016  consistent with the higher volume described above 

review of 2015  vs 2014   



the change in product revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



ship construction revenue increased in 2015 due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program and commercial jones act ships aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of g650 aircraft product operating costs increased in 2015 due primarily to higher volume on the programs described above 

the change in service revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



ship engineering repair and other services revenue was up in 2015 due to increased development work on the columbiaclass submarine program it services revenue decreased due to lower volume on several programs particularly the group’s commercial wireless work military vehicle services revenue decreased due primarily to the completion of the gcv design and development program service operating costs decreased in 2015 due primarily to lower volume on the programs described above as well as costreduction efforts in the information systems and technology group 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 62 percent  in 2016  and 2015  and 64 percent  in 2014  ga expenses in 2014  included 29 of severancerelated charges in our european military vehicles business in the combat systems group we expect ga expenses in 2017  to be generally consistent with 2016  

interest net 

net interest expense was 91  in 2016  83  in 2015  and 86  in 2014  we expect fullyear 2017  net interest expense to be approximately 110 up from 2016  due primarily to a 500 net increase in longterm debt beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and less interest income on lower cash balances 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 276 percent  in 2016  277 percent  in 2015  and 297 percent  in 2014  the effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by increased international activity and the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201609 for further discussion of the adoption of asu 201609 see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015  from 2014  was due primarily to the favorable impact of contract closeouts in 2015  for further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note e to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for 2017  we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent  

discontinued operations net of tax 

in 2013 we settled litigation with the us navy related to the terminated a12 aircraft contract in the company’s former tactical military aircraft business in connection with the settlement we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at the time at our bath maine shipyard as we have progressed through the shipbuilding process we have determined that the cost associated with this settlement is greater than anticipated therefore in the third quarter of 2016 we recognized an   84   loss net of tax to adjust the previouslyrecognized settlement value in addition we recognized a   10   loss net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company 

in 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our axle business in the combat systems group and recognized a   146   loss net of tax the sale was completed in january 2015   in the first quarter of 2016 we recognized a final adjustment of   13   to the loss on the sale of this business 

see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of these transactions 

2017 outlook 

our 2017 outlook has been developed under accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers which we adopted on january 1 2017 we have assessed our 2015 and 2016 operating results under asc topic 606 as outlined in the table that follows 

the impact of asc topic 606 on our 2015 and 2016 operating results may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent years results as described in the application of critical accounting policies discussion below aircraft manufacturing revenue in our aerospace group will be recognized when control is transferred to the customer generally at customer acceptance and final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft additionally use of the cumulative catchup method of recognizing adjustments in estimated profits on our longterm contracts will require us to recognize the total impact of an adjustment in the period it is identified rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term as we have in the past 



the following 2017 outlook for each of our business groups is compared with the 2016 restated operating results under the new standard shown in the table above 

 for further discussion of our adoption of asc topic 606 see the application of critical accounting policies discussion below and note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 598 billion  at the end of 2016  compared with 661 billion  at the end of 2015  our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 848 billion  on december 31 2016  

estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace group ended 2016  with backlog of 11 billion  compared with 134 billion  at yearend 2015  

orders in 2016  reflected solid demand across our product and services portfolio we continued to receive additional orders for the new family of business jets introduced in 2014 the g500 and g600 aircraft which are expected to enter into service in 2017 and 2018 respectively as well as orders for all models of inproduction aircraft 

estimated potential contract value in the aerospace group represents primarily options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers estimated potential contract value was 21 billion on december 31 2016  down slightly from 24 billion at yearend 2015  

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and privately held companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented over half of the group’s orders in 2016 and approximately 45 percent of the group’s backlog on december 31 2016  demonstrating continued strong domestic demand 

defense groups 

the total backlog in our three defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments we have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts that we believe we are likely to receive funding but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the funding necessary for a given program 

total backlog in our defense groups was 488 billion  on december 31 2016  down from 527 billion  at the end of 2015  estimated potential contract value was 229 billion on december 31 2016  compared with 22 billion at yearend 2015  

combat systems 

combat systems’ total backlog was 177 billion  at the end of 2016  down from 19 billion  at yearend 2015  as the group performs on significant multiyear contracts the group’s backlog includes remaining work on two major contracts awarded in 2014 

 the group also has several additional international military vehicle production contracts in backlog notably 



the us army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 850 of the group’s backlog on december 31 2016  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2018 the group received 900 of stryker orders in 2016  including awards to produce doublevhulled vehicles upgrade vehicles with an integrated 30millimeter cannon and provide contractor logistics support and engineering services 

the group’s backlog on december 31 2016  included 810 for abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies around the world including 210 for m1a2 system enhancement program sep components and associated program management and 155 to refurbish and upgrade abrams main battle tanks to the situational awareness configuration for the kingdom of morocco the group received 500 of abrams orders in 2016  

the combat systems group’s backlog on december 31 2016  also included 23 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs including 170 received in 2016 from the army for production of hydra70 rockets 

combat systems’ estimated potential contract value was 47 billion  on december 31 2016  down slightly from 51 billion at yearend 2015  

information systems and technology 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards the group’s total backlog was 84 billion  at the end of 2016  down slightly from 86 billion  at yearend 2015  this amount does not include 143 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2016  funding under idiq contracts and options contributed 39 billion to the group’s orders 

the group achieved a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenue of approximately onetoone in 2016  driven by several significant contract awards during the year including the following 



 the group’s backlog at yearend 2016  also included the following key programs 

 marine systems   

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the group periodically receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years this backlog then decreases over subsequent years as the group performs on these contracts consistent with this pattern backlog decreased to 227 billion  on december 31 2016  compared with 251 billion  at the end of 2015  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2016  and the largest contract in the company’s backlog in 2014 we received a contract for the construction of 10 submarines 

in block iv of the program the group’s backlog at yearend 2016  included 141 billion for 15 virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023 

navy destroyer programs represented 35 billion of the group’s backlog at yearend 2016  we have construction contracts for seven ddg51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2022 backlog at yearend 2016  also included two ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2020 

the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2016  included 625 for construction of esb auxiliary support ships the group has delivered the first three ships in the program and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

in 2016 we were awarded a sixship contract by the navy for the detailed design and construction of a new class of fleet oilers the john lewis class tao205 backlog at yearend 2016  included 600 for the lead ship an additional 24 billion is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end representing options for the additional five ships 

the yearend backlog also included 530 for four lngconversionready jones act ships for commercial customers scheduled for delivery through 2020 

complementing these ship construction programs engineering services represented approximately 18 billion of the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2016  design and development efforts on the columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine program represent 375 of this amount the approved cr permits the dod to use specified procurement funds to begin advance procurement and detailed design work for the columbiaclass submarine program allowing the program to move forward as planned in fy 2017 additionally yearend backlog for maintenance repair and other services totaled 15 billion 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and fund capital expenditures 

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks rated aa3 or higher on december 31 2016  11 billion  of our cash was held by nonus operations should this cash be repatriated it generally would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits 



note prior period information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of certain items in accordance with asu 201609 for further discussion of the adoption of asu 201609 see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 22 billion  in 2016  26 billion  in 2015   and   38 billion  in 2014  in all three years the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings operating cash flows in 2014 included significant customer deposits related to a large contract for a middle eastern customer awarded in our combat systems group in 2015 and 2016 operating cash flows were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital as these deposits were utilized in our aerospace group the buildup of inventory related to the new g500 and g600 aircraft programs also unfavorably affected operating cash flows in both years 

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities was 426  in 2016  compared with cash provided by investing activities of 200  in 2015  and cash used for investing activities of 11 billion  in 2014  our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from asset sales 

capital expenditures  the primary use of investing cash in all three years was capital expenditures capital expenditures were 392  in 2016  569  in 2015  and 521  in 2014  we expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent  of revenue in 2017  

marketable securities in 2015 we received 500 of proceeds from maturing heldtomaturity securities purchased in 2014 other net purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material 

other net  investing activities also include proceeds from the sale of assets and cash paid for business acquisitions in 2016 we acquired an aircraft management and charter services provider in our aerospace group and a manufacturer of unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs in our information systems and technology group in 2015 we completed the sale of our axle business in the combat systems group and a commercial cyber security business in our information systems and technology group in 2014 we completed an acquisition of a provider of it support to us special operations forces in our information systems and technology group 

financing activities 

we used 22 billion  in 2016  44 billion  in 2015  and 37 billion  in 2014  for financing activities our financing activities include repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt repayments net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from debt issuances and employee stock option exercises 

share repurchases  we repurchased 142 million  of our outstanding shares in 2016  for 2 billion  228 million  shares in 2015  for 32 billion  and 29 million  shares in 2014  for 34 billion  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 14 percent  since the end of 2013  as some of these share repurchases had not settled on december 31 2016  the associated 35  cash outflow will be reported in the first quarter of 2017 on december 31 2016  54 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately 2 percent of our total shares outstanding 

dividends  on march 2 2016  our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 076  per share the 19 th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 069  per share in march 2015  and 062  per share in march 2014  cash dividends paid were 911 in 2016  873 in 2015  and 822 in 2014  

debt issuances and repayments  in 2016  we repaid 500  of fixedrate notes on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued 1 billion of fixedrate notes for general corporate purposes in 2015 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities 

we have no additional material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until 900 of fixedrate notes mature in november 2017 as we approach the maturity date of this debt we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates 

we ended 2016  with no  commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion  in bank credit facilities that remain available including a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2018  and a 1 billion  facility expiring in november 2020  these facilities are for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and are required by credit rating agencies to support our commercial paper issuances we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and roic to measure our performance in 

these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 



 not meaningful nm due to net loss in 2012 

as discussed previously the decrease in free cash flow from operations in 2016 and 2015 is due primarily to growth in operating working capital in our aerospace and combat systems groups 

return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year roic excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



 2012 loss from continuing operations of 381 has been adjusted for a 2 billion goodwill impairment and associated 199 tax benefit 2012 shareholders’ equity a component of average invested capital has been similarly adjusted

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2016  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2016  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 163 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue recognition 

we account for revenue and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method we recognize contract costs and revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced or as services are rendered  we determine progress using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense business based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft   we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review and update our contractrelated estimates regularly 

we recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under the reallocation method the impact of an adjustment in estimate is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term the net impact of adjustments in contract estimates on our operating earnings and on a diluted pershare basis totaled favorable adjustments of   246   052  in 2016  222   044  in 2015  and 184   035  in 2014  no adjustment on any one contract was material to our consolidated financial statements in   2016  2015  or 2014  

consistent with industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year all contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet in a net asset contracts in process or liability customer advances and 

deposits position on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period our us government customer generally asserts title to or a security interest in inventoried costs related to such contracts as a result of advances and progress payments we reflect these advances and progress payments as an offset to the related inventoried costs  

change in revenue recognition standard adoption of asc topic 606  we adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers on january 1 2017 the standard outlines a fivestep model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied the standard also requires new expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition  we adopted the new standard using the retrospective transition method 

implementation plan   because the new standard impacted our business processes systems and controls we developed a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation which commenced in 2014 this project plan included analyzing the standard’s impact on our contract portfolio comparing our historical accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard and identifying differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts we developed internal controls to ensure that we adequately evaluated our portfolio of contracts under the fivestep model to ensure proper assessment of our operating results under asc topic 606 we reported on the progress of the implementation to the audit committee and the board of directors on a regular basis during the project’s duration 

asc topic 606 impacts   the majority of our longterm contracts will continue to recognize revenue and earnings over time as the work progresses because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer generally using an input measure eg costs incurred to reflect progress the adoption of asc topic 606 will have two primary impacts on our portfolio of contracts and our consolidated financial statements we will be precluded from using the reallocation method of recognizing adjustments in estimated profit on contracts  the total impact of an adjustment in estimated profit recorded to date on a contract will be recognized in the period it is identified cumulative catchup method rather than recognizing the impact of an adjustment prospectively over the remaining contract term as a result adjustments in contract estimates may be larger and likely more variable from period to period particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period for example in our marine systems group despite this variability a contract’s cash flows and overall profitability at completion are the same under the cumulative catchup method and the reallocation method anticipated losses on contracts will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified 

for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft in the aerospace group we will record revenue under asc topic 606 at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally when the customer accepts the fully outfitted aircraft asc topic 606 will not change the total revenue or operating earnings recognized for each aircraft only the timing of when those amounts are recognized prior to the adoption of asc topic 606 we recorded revenue for these contracts at two contractual milestones when green aircraft were completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepted final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

numerous other contracts in our portfolio were impacted by asc topic 606 due primarily to the identification of multiple performance obligations within a single contract 

on our consolidated balance sheet longterm contracts will continue to be reported in a net contract asset contracts in process or contract liability customer advances and deposits position on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period businessjet components in our aerospace group will be reported in inventory until control of the aircraft transfers to the customer the assessment of our 

december 31 2016 consolidated balance sheet under asc topic 606 will result in some reclassifications among financial statement accounts but these reclassifications will not materially change the total amount of net assets as of december 31 2016 

see note s to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our adoption of asc topic 606 

longlived assets and goodwill 

we review longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows impairment losses where identified are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the longlived asset over its estimated fair value  

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations  this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2016  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair values of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are consistent with our business groups the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values as of december 31 2016  

commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs 

certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid  we 

have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts  we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans 

our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in 2016 we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost previously the cost was determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known as the spot rate approach we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve compared to the previous method the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest components of our benefit costs slightly in 2016 we accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy following an assessment of the longterm returns of our various asset classes we will alter the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our primary us government and commercial pension plans by 75 basis points beginning in 2017 decreasing the weighted average expected longterm rate of return to approximately 74 percent this decrease is not expected to have a material impact on our 2017 benefit costs 

in 2016 we adopted an updated mortality improvement scale published by the society of actuaries that reflects a slower average rate of improvement in mortality than in previous years additionally we updated other assumptions to better align them with historical experience and anticipated future experience including rates of retirement and cost of living increases the impact of these changes was a net decrease of   247  and 14   in the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively on december 31 2016   

these retirement plan estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions  in the event any of the assumptions change pension and other postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts therefore the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the  retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results 

accounting standards updates 

see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2016 and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb but are not effective until after december 31 2016 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of 63 billion  on december 31 2016  and 72 billion  on december 31 2015  a 10 percent  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax losses 



foreign currency our exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar euro and british pound exchange rates these losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2016  we had 39 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

investment risk  our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2016  we held 23 billion  in cash and equivalents but held no marketable securities

aerospace 

our aerospace group is at the forefront of the businessjet industry we deliver a family of gulfstream aircraft provide aircraft services and perform completions for aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers oems with more than 50 years of experience the aerospace group is known for 

 gulfstream aerospace corporation designs develops manufactures services and supports the world’s most technologically advanced businessjet aircraft our product line includes aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options in the large and midcabin businessjet market the varying ranges speeds and cabin dimensions are wellsuited for the needs of a diverse and global customer base 

in 2015 gulfstream was awarded the collier trophy for the design and development of the g650 businessjet family this is gulfstream’s third time receiving the national aeronautic association’s annual award which recognizes the greatest achievement in us aeronautics or astronautics with respect to 

improving performance efficiency and safety the g650 family includes the g650 and the extendedrange g650er the ultralongrange g650er flies farther at faster speeds than any other business jet on the market and can travel 7500 nautical miles at mach 085 the g650 entered into service in 2012 and the g650er was introduced and delivered in 2014 in february 2015 the g650er set two citypair records while flying around the world with one stop together the g650 and g650er hold more than 50 world speed records 

we are committed to research and development rd activities to ensure we continue to introduce new products and firsttomarket enhancements that broaden customer choice improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety comfort and inflight productivity in 2014 we also introduced two new largecabin business jets the g500 and g600 these cleansheet nextgeneration business jets optimize the speed widecabin comfort efficiency and advanced safety technology of the aircraft at mach 085 the g500 can fly 5000 nautical miles and the g600 can fly 6200 nautical miles the g500 completed its first flight in may 2015 and has since completed hundreds of test flight hours at speeds up to mach 0995 and altitude over 50000 feet the g500 and g600 are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019 respectively these new aircraft demonstrate our consistent and disciplined investment in gulfstream 

our product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics composites renewable fuels flightcontrol systems acoustics cabin technologies and vision systems a recent example is the symmetry flight deck introduced with the g500 and g600 which includes 10 touchscreens and active control sidesticks the touchscreens improve how pilots interact with onboard systems and the sidesticks are digitally linked to allow both pilots to see and feel each other’s control inputs enhancing situational awareness and further improving safety of the flight 

gulfstream has an ongoing environmental sustainability program including the use of renewable fuels in 2015 we finalized an industryfirst threeyear agreement that provides gulfstream with a consistent supply of renewable fuels for daily flight operations from its headquarters in savannah georgia each gallon of renewable fuel burned is expected to achieve a more than 50percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis relative to petroleumbased jet fuel 

gulfstream designs develops and manufactures aircraft in savannah including manufacturing all largecabin models the midcabin models are constructed by a nonus partner all models are outfitted in the group’s us facilities in support of gulfstream’s growing aircraft portfolio and international customer base we have invested in multiyear facilities projects at our savannah campus which are scheduled to continue through 2017 this expansion consists of constructing new facilities including the completed purposebuilt g500 and g600 manufacturing facilities and renovating existing infrastructure this effort follows earlier projects including a purposebuilt g650 manufacturing facility increased aircraftservice capacity an improved customer sales and design center and a stateoftheart paint facility

marine systems 

our marine systems group is a marketleading designer and builder of nuclearpowered submarines surface combatants and auxiliary and combatlogistics ships for the us navy and jones act ships for commercial customers we provide highvalueadded engineering construction and assembly work as well as lifecycle support the group’s portfolio of platforms and diverse capabilities includes 

 we have a long history as one of the primary shipbuilders for the us navy we construct and deliver new ships and design and develop the nextgeneration of platforms for the navy more than 90 percent of the group’s revenue is for major navy shipconstruction engineering and lifecycle support programs awarded under large multiship contracts that span several years these programs include virginiaclass nuclearpowered submarines built by electric boat arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and ddg1000 guidedmissile destroyers manufactured by bath iron works and expeditionary mobile base esb auxiliary support ships produced by nassco 

we are the prime contractor for the virginiaclass submarine program designed for the full range of global mission requirements including intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch these stealthy boats excel in littoral and openocean environments we have delivered 12 submarines in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction in 2015 we completed the rampup in construction from one to two virginiaclass submarines per year the remaining 16 submarines under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023 we are also developing the virginia payload module vpm for the next block of virginiaclass submarines that is expected to start construction in 2019 the vpm is an 80foot hull section that will add four additional payload tubes boosting strike capacity by 230 percent and preserving the united states’ critical undersea capabilities 

the group is currently performing development work for the replacement of the navy’s ohioclass ballistic missile submarine fleet which will reach the end of its service life starting in 2027 these ohioclass replacement submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades to come the lead ship is slated to start construction in 2021 with delivery to the navy in 2027 we are preparing our workforce 

and facilities for the start of construction for the ohioclass replacement program this includes a new 113000squarefoot automated frame and cylinder facility that we recently built in quonset point rhode island to support the common missile compartment work under joint development for the us navy and the uk royal navy

to further the group’s goals of operating efficiency innovation and affordability for the customer we make strategic investments in our business often in cooperation with the navy in addition the marine systems group leverages its design and engineering expertise across its shipyards to improve program 

execution and generate cost savings this knowledge sharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements we are wellpositioned to continue to fulfill the shipconstruction and support requirements of our customers 

revenue for the marine systems group was 25 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2015  24 percent  in 2014  and 22 percent  in 2013  revenue by major products and services was as follows 



customers 

in 2015  57 percent  of our revenue was from the us government 17 percent  was from us commercial customers 13 percent  was from nonus commercial customers and the remaining 13 percent  was from nonus government customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community the departments of homeland security and health and human services and firstresponder agencies our revenue from the us government was as follows 



 in addition to our direct nonus sales we sell to nonus governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the nonus government customer 

our us government businesses operate under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials 

in our us government business fixedprice contracts accounted for 54 percent  in 2015  53 percent  in 2014  and 54 percent  in 2013  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 42 percent  in 2015  43 percent  in 2014  and 42 percent  in 2013  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 4 percent  in 2015  2014  and 2013  

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages typically we assume more risk with fixedprice contracts however these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the 

work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk accordingly the associated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixedprice contracts additionally some costs are unallowable under these types of contracts and the government reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates also because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs the content mix can impact margin rates 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenue was 53 billion  in 2015  and 2014  and 54 billion  in 2013  this represented approximately 17 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2015  and 2014  and 18 percent  in 2013  the majority of this revenue is for businessjet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries 

nonus 

our revenue from nonus government and commercial customers was 82 billion  in 2015  76 billion  in 2014  and 63 billion  in 2013  this represented approximately 26 percent  of our consolidated revenue in 2015  25 percent  in 2014  and 20 percent  in 2013  

we conduct business with customers around the world providing a broad portfolio of products and services our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our nonus commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from nonus customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 55 percent  of the aerospace group’s total backlog on december 31 2015  

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the united states we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and nonus businesses our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems group has one primary 

competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in our maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in our completions business the group competes with other oems as well as several thirdparty providers 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd investing in technologies and capabilities that provide solutions for our customers in accordance with 

government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2015  our subsidiaries had 99900  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 6 percent  of total employees are due to expire in 2016  historically we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems our us government customer is a supplier on some of our programs these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal 

acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs should be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus revenue is subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the us and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of materials substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

available information 

we file reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763583 the sec maintains a website wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information these items also can be read and copied at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 information on the operation of the public reference room is available by calling the sec at 800 sec0330 




 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenue is concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and nonus defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenue  approximately 55 percent of our revenue is from the us government levels of us defense spending are driven by threats to national security competing demands for federal funds pressure various areas of spending and defense investment accounts budgets for procurement and research and development remain under pressure decreases in us government defense spending including investment accounts or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which has occurred in recent years for example changes in congressional 

schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenue under existing multiyear contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings 

government contractors are subject to audit by the us government  numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially as a result 

earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 

if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially 

earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities which may occur suddenly nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our nonus business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our nonus business 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices some new products particularly in our aerospace group must meet extensive and timeconsuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs

business environment 

with approximately 55 percent of our revenue from the us government our financial performance is impacted by us government spending levels particularly defense spending over the past several years us defense spending has been reduced as mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca and its related sequester mechanism the bca restricts discretionary spending over a tenyear period through 2021 by establishing spending caps 

in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba raised the spending cap for government fiscal year fy 2016 and fy 2017 by 25 billion and 15 billion respectively in accordance with the bba the congress appropriated 514 billion in fy 2016 for the department of defense dod including approximately 188 billion for procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts these investment accounts are the source of the majority of our us government revenue an additional 59 billion appropriated for overseas contingency operations brings the total defense spending bill passed by the congress in december 2015 to 573 billion a 2 percent increase over fy 2015 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

we continue to pursue international opportunities presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our nonus operations and through exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant these opportunities are subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace group businessjet orders were strong in 2015  and reflected demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace group’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will continue to be a strong source of revenue as the global businessjet fleet grows 

in navigating the current business environment we continue to focus on improving operating earnings expanding margin and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash we emphasize effective program execution anticipate trends and react to changing circumstances in our business environment and drive costreduction activities across our business 

results of operations 

introduction 

an understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our financial statements and operating results we recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenue and operating costs in our business groups 

in the aerospace group contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenue on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors revenue associated with the group’s completions of other original equipment manufacturers’ oems aircraft and the group’s services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relate to new aircraft production on firm orders and consist of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft deliveries additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the volume of and market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net rd costs incurred by the group 

in the three defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized as work progresses as either products are produced or services are rendered as a result variations in revenue are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs yearoveryear variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor overhead and ga costs and are recognized generally as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenue 

operating earnings and margin in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared 

with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin work additionally higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 



2015  in review 

 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



we realized topline revenue growth in 2015  driven primarily by higher ship construction and engineering activity in our marine systems group and additional deliveries of g650 aircraft in our aerospace group revenue was down slightly in our combat systems and information systems and technology groups operating costs and expenses increased less than revenue in 2015  resulting in robust levels of operating earnings and margin consolidated operating margin expanded 70 basis points due largely to improved performance and continued costreduction efforts in the aerospace combat systems and information systems and technology groups 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



while our revenue was essentially flat in 2014  compared with 2013  operating earnings and margin increased in 2014  decreased us army spending affected our information systems and technology and combat systems groups this was essentially offset by higher aerospace and marine systems revenue due to increased aircraft deliveries and higher ship construction activity respectively we reduced our operating costs and expenses more than our revenue declined in 2014  resulting in positive operating leverage the primary drivers of the decrease in operating costs and expenses were improved performance in aircraft manufacturing and outfitting activities in the aerospace group and significant cost reductions in the information systems and technology group the resulting consolidated operating margin of 126 percent  was up 70 basis points over 2013  

review of business groups 



following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed for specific types of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the lines of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results additional information regarding our business groups can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2015  vs 2014   



the increase in the aerospace group’s revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased in 2015  due primarily to additional deliveries of the g650 aircraft midcabin aircraft deliveries were also up slightly we had seven preowned aircraft sales in 2015  compared with three sales in 2014  

the increase in the group’s operating earnings in 2015  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings grew in 2015  due to an increase in higherpriced g650 aircraft deliveries operating earnings in 2015  were also favorably affected by a firstquarter 2015 supplier settlement associated with aircraft component design and delivery delays the group’s services performance reflected a favorable mix of work partially offsetting these increases the group’s performance was impacted by slightly higher net rd expenses included in gaother expenses above associated with ongoing productdevelopment efforts overall the aerospace groups operating margin increased 70  basis points to 193 percent  in 2015  

review of 2014  vs 2013 



the aerospace group’s revenue and earnings increased in 2014  due primarily to additional deliveries of largecabin aircraft operating earnings also increased in 2014  due to improved operating performance on our large and midcabin aircraft production offset partially by higher net rd expenses 

2016  outlook 

we expect the group’s 2016  revenue to be modestly higher and margin somewhat lower compared with 2015  

combat systems 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



the slight decrease in the combat systems group’s revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



in 2015  revenue from us military vehicles declined as a result of the completion of the ground combat vehicle gcv design and development program this decrease was offset partially by a rampup in work on the stryker engineering change proposal ecp upgrade program weapons systems and munitions revenue decreased in 2015  due primarily to lower volume of hydra70 rockets and decreased ammunition production for us allies revenue from international military vehicles decreased slightly in 2015  due to lower revenue on several mature international contracts that are nearing completion offset largely by growth on new international programs that are ramping up for customers in the united kingdom and the middle east 

translation of our international businesses’ revenue into us dollars in 2015  has been affected negatively by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro had foreign currency exchange rates in 2015  held constant from 2014  2015  revenue would have grown by 6 percent over 2014  

the combat systems groups operating margin increased 60  basis points in 2015  the operating results reflect the groups strong operating performance and cost cutting across the business including reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities completed in 2014  

review of 2014   vs 2013 



in 2014 lower us military vehicles revenue was offset largely by higher revenue associated with international military vehicles us military vehicle revenue was down in 2014  due to a decrease in us army spending as the us involvement in the iraqi and afghan conflicts wound down this impacted our primary us vehicle programs including stryker abrams buffalo and mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles revenue also decreased on the completed gcv design and development program revenue for international military vehicles was up significantly in 2014  as work commenced on a major international order received in the first quarter of 2014  

the combat systems groups operating margin decreased 60 basis points in 2014  due primarily to a mix shift from more mature programs nearing completion to the start up of new programs somewhat offsetting this shift in contract mix operating margin was up in our european and weapons systems businesses as a result of reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities completed in 2013 and early 2014 

2016  outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s revenue to increase slightly in 2016 operating margin is expected to remain strong in the mid15 percent range consistent with 2015 

information systems and technology 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



the information systems and technology group’s revenue in 2015  was slightly lower than 2014  the decrease from the prior year consisted of the following 



 command control communication computing c4 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr solutions 

it services revenue decreased in 2015  due to lower volume on several programs including our commercial wireless work these decreases were offset partially by revenue from the late 2014 acquisition of a provider of it support to us special operations forces revenue decreased slightly in our c4isr 

solutions business due in part to lower volume on the handheld manpack and small form fit hms radio program 

the group’s operating margin increased 150  basis points in 2015  this margin expansion was driven primarily by improved program performance and rightsizing across the group including the favorable impact from the early 2015 consolidation of two of our businesses to form general dynamics mission systems operating earnings in 2015  also included a gain of 23 on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business a 30 basispoint impact 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



in 2014 revenue was down across the information systems and technology group revenue decreased in the c4isr solutions business in 2014  primarily as a result of lower us army spending on several programs revenue decreased in 2014  in our it services business due to lower volume on multiple programs including our commercial wireless work offset partially by increased contactcenter services work under our contract with the centers for medicare  medicaid services despite the revenue decline the groups operating margin increased 90 basis points in 2014  the result of solid operating performance and ongoing costreduction efforts across our businesses 

2016  outlook 

we expect 2016  revenue in the information systems and technology group to be consistent with 2015  operating margins are expected to approach doubledigits 

marine systems 

review of 2015   vs   2014   



the increase in the marine systems group’s revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



the increase in us navy ship construction revenue in 2015  is due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program in 2015 we completed the rampup in construction from one to two virginiaclass submarines per year this increase was offset partially by lower volume on the expeditionary mobile base esb program revenue from us navy ship engineering repair and other services increased in 

2015  due primarily to development work on the ohioclass submarine replacement program commercial ship construction revenue increased in 2015  as work ramped up on the groups construction of jones act ships 

operating margin decreased 50  basis points in 2015  due primarily to a shift in contract mix including a gap in production on the mature esb program that was replaced by jones act commercial ship contracts and the transition from block iii to block iv of the virginiaclass submarine program the groups operating margin was also affected unfavorably by cost growth on the navys ddg1000 program and the restart of the ddg51 program 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



the marine systems group’s revenue increased in 2014  due primarily to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program including longlead materials for the block iv contract and increased work on the group’s construction of jones act ships revenue for navy engineering repair and other services decreased in 2014  caused by lower spending by the navy on submarinerelated overhaul and repair services operating margin decreased 30 basis points in 2014  due primarily to a shift in contract mix as work on the block iv virginiaclass and jones act commercial ship contracts ramped up and volume decreased on mature contracts including esb and blocks ii and iii of the virginiaclass program in addition construction progressed on the first of the three ddg1000 ships and two of the ddg51 ships in the navy’s restart of the program 

2016  outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s 2016  revenue to be consistent with 2015  operating margin is expected to improve to the mid9 percent range 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate costs totaled 41  in 2015  72  in 2014   and 96  in 2013  the decrease in 2015 is due primarily to lower compensation expense for stock options as options granted beginning in 2015 have a threeyear vesting period versus a twoyear vesting period for prior option grants see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our equity compensation plans including changes made to our equity compensation plans in 2015  we expect corporate operating costs in 2016  of approximately 45 

other information 

product and service revenue and operating costs 

review of 2015  vs 2014 



the increase in product revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



ship construction revenue increased in 2015  due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program and commercial jones act ships aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased in 2015  due to additional deliveries of g650 aircraft 

product operating costs increased in 2015  due primarily to higher volume on the programs described above 

the decrease in service revenue in 2015  consisted of the following 



ship engineering repair and other services revenue was up in 2015  due to increased development work on the ohioclass submarine replacement program it services revenue decreased in 2015  due to lower volume on several programs military vehicle services revenue decreased in 2015  due primarily to the completion of the gcv design and development program 

service operating costs decreased in 2015  due primarily to lower volume on the programs described above as well as costreduction efforts in the information systems and technology group 

review of 2014  vs 2013   



the increase in product revenue in 2014  consisted of the following 



ship construction revenue increased in 2014 due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program and commercial jones act ships aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of largecabin aircraft offsetting these increases lower us army spending negatively impacted revenue from c4isr products preowned aircraft sales were down as there were fewer aircraft tradeins and resulting sales in 2014 

product operating costs increased in 2014 due primarily to higher volume on the programs described above costs in 2014 were also affected by higher net rd expenses in the aerospace group associated with ongoing product development efforts 

the decrease in service revenue in 2014 consisted of the following 



c4isr services and military vehicle services revenue was lower due to decreased us army spending while it services revenue decreased due to reduced commercial wireless work 

service operating costs decreased in 2014 due primarily to lower volume on the programs described above 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenue ga expenses were 62 percent  in 2015  64 percent  in 2014  and 66 percent  in 2013  ga expenses in 2014  included 29 of severancerelated charges in our european military vehicles 

business in the combat systems group we expect ga expenses in 2016  to be generally consistent with 2015  

interest net 

net interest expense was 83  in 2015  and 86  in 2014  and 2013  we expect fullyear 2016  net interest expense to be approximately 95 up from 2015  due to less interest income on lower cash balances expected in 2016  

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 277 percent  in 2015  297 percent  in 2014  and 312 percent  in 2013  the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015  was due primarily to the favorable impact of contract closeouts in 2015  for further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note e to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we anticipate the fullyear effective tax rate to be in the mid 29 percent  range in 2016  

discontinued operations net of tax 

in 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our axle business in the combat systems group and recognized a 146 loss net of tax the sale was completed in january 2015 in 2013 we recognized a 129 loss net of tax from the settlement of our litigation with the us navy related to the terminated a12 contract in the company’s discontinued tactical military aircraft business see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of these transactions 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 661 billion  at the end of 2015  compared with 724 billion  on december 31 2014  our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 906 billion  on december 31 2015  

estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the 

election of the customer the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace group ended 2015  with backlog of 134 billion  up from 132 billion  at yearend 2014  

orders in 2015  reflected strong demand across our product portfolio we continued to build our backlog with additional orders for the new family of business jets introduced in 2014 the g500 and g600 aircraft which are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019 respectively as well as orders for all models of inproduction aircraft in addition we received several orders in 2015  for custom completions of narrow and widebody aircraft in our jet aviation business 

estimated potential contract value in the aerospace group primarily represents options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers estimated potential contract value was 24 billion on december 31 2015  down slightly from 27 billion at yearend 2014  

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and private companies individuals and governments around the world geographically us customers represented approximately 45 percent of the group’s backlog on december 31 2015  up from yearend 2014  given strong domestic demand 

defense groups 

the total backlog in our three defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments we have included in total backlog 

firm contracts at the amounts that we believe are likely to receive funding but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the funding necessary for a given program 

total backlog in our defense groups was 527 billion  on december 31 2015  down from 592 billion  at the end of 2014  estimated potential contract value was 22 billion on december 31 2015  compared with 239 billion at yearend 2014  

combat systems 

after tripling in 2014 combat systems’ total backlog was 19 billion  at the end of 2015  down slightly from 198 billion  at yearend 2014  the group’s backlog includes two major contracts awarded in 2014 

 the combat systems group also has several additional international military vehicle production contracts in backlog notably 

 the us army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 670 of the group’s backlog on december 31 2015  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2017 the group received 590 of stryker orders in 2015  including awards for doublevhulled vehicles contractor logistics support and engineering services the group’s backlog on december 31 2015  included 780 for abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies around the world including 275 to refurbish and upgrade 150 abrams main battle tanks to the situational awareness configuration for the kingdom of morocco 

the combat systems group’s backlog on december 31 2015  also included 23 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs including 125 received in 2015 from the army for production of hydra70 rockets 

combat systems’ estimated potential contract value was 51 billion  on december 31 2015  down slightly from 55 billion at yearend 2014  

information systems and technology 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards the group’s total backlog was 86 billion  at the end of 2015  unchanged from yearend 2014  this amount does not include 147 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2015  funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 4 billion to the group’s orders 

the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2015  including the following 

 backlog at yearend 2015  also included the following key programs 

 

 marine systems   

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the group periodically receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years this backlog then decreases over subsequent years as the group performs on these contracts consistent with this pattern backlog decreased to 251 billion  on december 31 2015  compared with 308 billion  at the end of 2014  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2015  and the largest contract in the company’s backlog in 2014 we received a contract for the construction of 10 submarines in block iv of the program the group’s backlog at yearend 2015  included 174 billion for 16 virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023 

navy destroyer programs represented 39 billion of the group’s backlog at yearend 2015  we have construction contracts for seven ddg51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2022 backlog at year end 2015  also included three ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2019 

the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2015  included 420 for construction of esb auxiliary support ships the group has delivered the first three ships in the program and construction is underway on the fourth ship scheduled for delivery in 2018 

the yearend backlog also included 350 for one liquefied natural gas lngpowered and seven lngconversionready jones act ships for commercial customers scheduled for delivery through 2017 

complementing these ship construction programs engineering services represented approximately 18 billion of the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2015  including 12 billion for design and development efforts on the ohioclass submarine replacement program additionally yearend backlog for maintenance repair and other services totaled 14 billion 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and fund capital expenditures 

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher on december 31 2015  11 billion  of our cash was held by nonus operations should this cash be repatriated it generally would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits 



note prior period information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to debt as discussed in note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 25 billion  in 2015  37 billion  in 2014   and   31 billion  in 2013  in all three years the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings operating cash flows in 2013 benefited from deposits received in the marine systems group for commercial ship orders in 2014 operating cash flows included significant customer deposits related to a large contract for a middle eastern customer awarded in our combat systems group in 2015 operating cash flows were negatively affected by the utilization of these deposits coupled with growth in operating working capital in our aerospace group consistent with building test aircraft for the g500 and g600 programs 

investing activities 

cash provided by investing activities was 200  in 2015  compared with a use of cash for investing activities of 11 billion  in 2014  and 363  in 2013  our primary investing activities were capital expenditures and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 569  in 2015  521  in 2014  and 436  in 2013  we expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent  of revenue in 2016  

marketable securities in 2015 we received 500 of proceeds from maturing heldtomaturity securities purchased in 2014 other net purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material 

other net  investing activities also include proceeds from the sale of assets and cash paid for business acquisitions in 2015 we completed the sale of our axle business in the combat systems group and a commercial cyber security business in our information systems and technology group in 2014 we completed an acquisition in our information systems and technology group 

financing activities 

we used 43 billion  in 2015  36 billion  in 2014  and 725  in 2013  for financing activities our financing activities included repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt repayments net cash from financing activities also included proceeds received from stock option exercises 

share repurchases  we repurchased 228 million  of our outstanding shares in 2015  for 32 billion  29 million  shares in 2014  for 34 billion  and 94 million  shares in 2013  for 740  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 12 percent  since the end of 2012 on december 31 2015  96 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately 3 percent of our total shares outstanding 

dividends  on march 4 2015  our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 069  per share the 18 th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 062  per share in march 2014  and 056  per share in march 2013  cash dividends paid were 873 in 2015  822 in 2014  and 591 in 2013  we did not pay any dividends in the first three months of 2013 because we accelerated our firstquarter dividend payment to december 2012 

debt repayments  in january 2015 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from the maturing marketable securities discussed above we have no additional material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until 500 of fixedrate notes mature in july 2016 as we approach the maturity date of this debt we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates 

we ended 2015  with no  commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion  in bank credit facilities that remain available including a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2018  and a 1 billion  facility expiring in november 2020  these facilities are for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and are required by rating agencies to support our commercial paper issuances we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the debt markets 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



 not meaningful nm due to net loss in 2012 

as discussed previously the decrease in free cash flow from operations in 2015 is due primarily to the utilization of customer deposits and growth in operating working capital in our aerospace group 

return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year roic excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance 

roic is calculated as follows 



2012 loss from continuing operations of 381 has been adjusted for a 2 billion goodwill impairment and associated 199 tax benefit 2012 shareholders’ equity a component of average invested capital has been similarly adjusted 

additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2015  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2015  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 211 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pension and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

in our opinion the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue recognition  we account for revenue and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method contract costs and revenue are recognized as the work progresses either as the products are produced or as services are rendered we determine progress using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense business based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates 

of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review our performance monthly and update our contractrelated estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events and circumstances 

we recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under the reallocation method the impact of a revision in estimate is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our longterm contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catchup method the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catchup method 

the net impact of revisions in contract estimates on our operating earnings and on a diluted pershare basis totaled favorable changes of 222   044  in 2015  184   035  in 2014  and 351   065  in 2013  no revisions on any one contract were material to our consolidated financial statements in 2015  2014  or 2013  

consistent with defense industry practice we classify assets and liabilities related to longterm contracts as current even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year all contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheets in a net asset contracts in process or liability customer advances and deposits position on a contractbycontract basis at the end of each reporting period our us government customer generally asserts title to or a security interest in inventoried costs related to such contracts as a result of advances and progress payments we reflect these advances and progress payments as an offset to the related inventoried costs 

in the second quarter of 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap the standard outlines a fivestep model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied the standard also requires new expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition several updates have been proposed since the issuance of asu 201409 these updates are intended to allow for a more consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard once these updates are issued by the fasb in 2016 the standard will be final 

asu 201409 is effective in the first quarter of 2018 for public companies however entities can elect to adopt one year earlier in the first quarter of 2017 the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method 

we are utilizing a bottomup approach to analyze the standard’s impact on our contract portfolio taking a fresh look at historical accounting policies and practices and identifying potential differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts while this assessment continues we have not yet selected a transition date or method nor have we yet determined the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements we expect this determination will near completion in the second half of 2016 because the new standard will impact our business processes systems and controls we have developed a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation 

the required adoption of the asu will preclude our use of the reallocation method of recognizing revisions in estimated profit on contracts discussed above as changes in estimated profit will be recognized in the period they are identified cumulative catchup method rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term we expect the impact of revisions of contract estimates may be larger and potentially more variable from period to period anticipated losses on contracts will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified 

goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2015  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair values of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are consistent with our business groups the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values as of december 31 2015  

we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows impairment losses where identified are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the longlived asset 

commitments and contingencies  we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs  certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing 

backlog and probable followon contracts we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans  our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy we base the discount rate on a current yield curve developed for a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period 

beginning in 2016 we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost previously the cost was determined using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve under the refined method known as the spot rate approach we will use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each benefit payment we believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve compared to the previous method the spot rate approach will decrease the service and interest components of our benefit costs slightly in 2016 there is no impact on the total benefit obligation we will account for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

these retirement plan estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event any of the assumptions change pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenue and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings 

new accounting standards  there are several new accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb but are not yet effective 

 

cost or nrv less a normal profit margin when measuring inventory we intend to adopt the standard prospectively on the effective date of january 1 2017 we do not expect the adoption of asu 201511 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

 other asus issued by the fasb but not yet effective are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency  we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of 72 billion  on december 31 2015  and 91 billion  on december 31 2014  a 10 percent  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax losses 



this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar eurocanadian dollar and eurobritish pound exchange rates these losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2015  we had 34 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

investment risk  our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2015  we held 28 billion  in cash and equivalents but held no marketable securities

we operate globally through four business groups aerospace combat systems information systems and technology and marine systems for selected financial information regarding each of our business groups see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

our aerospace group designs manufactures and outfits a family of gulfstream businessjet aircraft provides aircraft services including maintenance and repair work fixedbased operations fbo and aircraft management services and performs aircraft completions for aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers oems with more than 50 years of experience at the forefront of the businessjet market the aerospace group is known for 

 the gulfstream product line includes aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options in the large and midcabin businessjet market the varying ranges speeds and cabin dimensions are wellsuited for the needs of a diverse and global customer base the largecabin models are manufactured at gulfstream’s headquarters in savannah georgia while the midcabin models are constructed by a nonus partner all models are outfitted in the group’s us facilities 

demand for gulfstream aircraft is strong across geographic regions and customer types generating orders from public and private companies individuals and governments around the world the gulfstream brand is recognized globally with nonus customers representing approximately 60 percent of the group’s backlog on december 31 2014 

we are committed to research and development rd activities that facilitate the introduction of new products and firsttomarket enhancements that broaden customer choice improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety comfort and inflight productivity in 2014 we introduced three new largecabin business jets the g500 the g600 and the g650er the g500 and g600 are cleansheet nextgeneration business jets that optimize the speed widecabin comfort efficiency and advanced safety technology of the aircraft at mach 085 the g500 can fly 5000 nautical miles and the g600 can fly 6200 

nautical miles the g500 and g600 are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019 respectively the g650er is the extendedrange sistership to the ultralong range ultralarge cabin g650 this new aircraft flies farther at faster speeds than any other business jet on the market and can travel 7500 nautical miles at mach 085 the first g650er was delivered in the fourth quarter of 2014 ahead of the original 2015 estimate these three new aircraft demonstrate the success of consistent and disciplined investment in gulfstream’s product development 

in addition to the new aircraft models current product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics composites renewable fuels flightcontrol systems acoustics cabin technologies and vision systems one recent innovation introduced with the g500 and g600 is the symmetry flight deck that includes 10 touchscreens and active control sidesticks the active control sidesticks allow the pilot and copilot to see and feel each other’s control inputs enhancing their situational awareness and safety of the flight we have also introduced several service and support applications including the planebook application which provides pilots easy and immediate digital access to critical flight information and aircraftspecific documents 

in support of gulfstream’s growing aircraft portfolio and international customer base we have invested in a multiyear facilities project at our savannah campus which is scheduled to continue through 2017 this expansion consists of constructing new facilities including the completed purposebuilt manufacturing facilities for production of the g500 and g600 and renovating existing infrastructure this effort follows earlier projects that included a purposebuilt g650 manufacturing facility increased aircraftservice capacity an improved customer sales and design center and a stateoftheart paint facility 

the group offers extensive support of the nearly 2500 gulfstream aircraft in service with professionals located around the globe the service network for gulfstream aircraft continues to evolve to address the demands of the group’s growing international customer base we operate 11 companyowned service centers maintain 15 authorized warranty centers and maintenance facilities on six continents and offer oncall gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy for urgent customerservice requirements in the americas this commitment to superior product support continues to receive industry recognition including the numberone ranking for the 12th consecutive year in the annual aviation international news product support survey as well as the top ranking in the annual professional pilot survey

revenues for the information systems and technology group were 30 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2014  and 33 percent  in 2013  and 2012  revenues by major products and services were as follows 



marine systems 

our marine systems group designs builds and supports submarines and surface ships for the us navy and jones act ships for commercial customers we are one of two primary shipbuilders for the navy the group’s diverse portfolio of platforms and capabilities includes 

 our work for the navy includes the construction of new ships and the design and development of nextgeneration platforms to help meet evolving missions and maintain desired fleet size approximately 95 percent  of the group’s revenues are for major navy shipconstruction programs awarded under large multiship contracts that span several years these programs include virginiaclass nuclearpowered submarines arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and zumwaltclass ddg1000 guidedmissile destroyers and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships 

the virginiaclass submarine includes capabilities for openocean and littoral missions these stealthy boats are wellsuited for a variety of global assignments including intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch the navy is procuring virginiaclass submarines in multiboat blocks in 2014  we received a contract for the construction of 10 submarines in the fourth block of the program bringing the number of boats under contract to 28  the group has delivered 11  of these boats in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction the remaining 17  boats under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023  

we are the lead designer and producer of ddg51s managing the design modernization and lifecycle support of these ships as the only active destroyer in the navy’s global surface fleet ddg51s are multimission combatants that offer defense against a wide range of threats including ballistic missiles we currently have construction contracts for seven  ddg51s scheduled for delivery through 2022  

the group is one of the navys contractors involved in development and construction of the ddg1000 platform these ships are equipped with numerous technological enhancements including a low radar profile an integrated power system and advanced gun systems that provide a threefold increase in range over current naval surface gun weapons deliveries of the three  ships in the program are scheduled through 2019  

mlp ships serve as floating transfer stations improving the navy’s ability to deliver equipment and cargo to areas without adequate port access the group has delivered the first two ships in the program and construction is underway on two additional ships scheduled for delivery in 2015  and 2018  the third and fourth ships are configured as afloat forward staging bases afsb designed to facilitate a variety of missions in support of mine countermeasures and special operations providing significant new capabilities to the customer 

in addition to these ship construction programs we are advancing new technologies and naval platforms with our customers these design and engineering efforts include the development of the nextgeneration ballisticmissile submarine to replace the ohio class of ballisticmissile submarines in conjunction with these efforts the group is leading the design of the common missile compartment under joint development for the us navy and the uk royal navy 

marine systems provides comprehensive ship and submarine overhaul repair and lifecycle support services to extend the service life and maximize the value of these ships we conduct surfaceship repair operations in four locations with fullservice maintenance and repair shipyards on both us coasts we also provide extensive submarine repair services in a variety of us locations and convert decommissioned submarines to moored training platforms in support of allied navies we offer program management planning engineering and design support for submarine and surfaceship construction programs 

beyond its work for the navy marine systems is advancing commercial shipbuilding technology with the design and production of liquefied natural gas lngpowered and lngconversionready ships for commercial customers that meet the jones act requirement for ships carrying cargo between us ports to be built in us shipyards currently we have construction contracts for 10  ships scheduled for delivery through 2017  construction is underway on five ships with all 10 expected to be at various stages of construction by the end of 2015 we anticipate that the age of the jones act fleet and environmental regulations that impose more stringent emission control limits will continue to provide additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities 

to further the group’s goals of operating efficiency innovation affordability for the customer and continuous improvement we make strategic investments in our business often in cooperation with the navy and local governments in addition marine systems leverages its design and engineering expertise across 

its shipyards to improve program execution and generate cost savings this knowledgesharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements we are wellpositioned to continue to fulfill the shipconstruction and support requirements of our customers 

revenues for the marine systems group were 24 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2014  22 percent   in 2013  and 21 percent  in 2012  revenues by major products and services were as follows 

  



customers 

in 2014  58 percent  of our revenues were from the us government 17 percent  were from us commercial customers 14 percent  were from nonus commercial customers and the remaining 11 percent  were from nonus defense customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the us department of defense dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community the departments of homeland security and health and human services and firstresponder agencies our revenues from the us government were as follows 



 in addition to our direct nonus sales we sell to nonus governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the nonus government customer 

we perform our us government business under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials 

in our us government business fixedprice contracts accounted for 53 percent  in 2014  54 percent  in 2013  and 56 percent  in 2012  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 43 percent  in 2014  42 percent  in 2013  and 39 percent  in 2012  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 4 percent  in 2014  and 2013  and 5 percent  in 2012  

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels as we assume more risk these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk 

accordingly the negotiated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixedprice contracts additionally not all costs are allowable under these types of contracts and the government reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates also because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs the content mix can impact profit margin rates 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 53 billion  in 2014  54 billion  in 2013  and 38 billion  in 2012  this represented approximately 17 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2014  18 percent  in 2013  and 12 percent  in 2012  the majority of these revenues are for businessjet aircraft and services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries 

nonus 

our direct revenues from nonus government and commercial customers were 76 billion  in 2014  63 billion  in 2013  and 64 billion  in 2012  this represented approximately 25 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2014  20 percent  in 2013  and 21 percent  in 2012  

we conduct business with government customers around the world with operations in australia canada germany mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our nonus commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from nonus customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 60 percent of total backlog on december 31 2014  

for a discussion of the risks associated with conducting business in locations outside the united states see risk factors contained herein for information regarding revenues and assets by geographic region see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and nonus companies for products and services we compete against other largeplatform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability outside the us we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and nonus businesses our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise our marine systems group has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in the businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in our maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in our completions business the group competes with other oems as well as several thirdparty providers 

  

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

  



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd in accordance with government regulations we recover a portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2014  our subsidiaries had 99500  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 2 percent  of total employees are due to expire in 2015  historically we have negotiated successor labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenues in the us these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year outside the us work for many of our government customers is weighted toward the end of the calendar year 

  

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal 

acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs should be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

nonus regulatory 

our nonus revenues are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the us and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

available information 

we file reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763583

 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to nonus customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and nonus defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenues  approximately 60 percent of our revenues are from the us government us defense spending is driven by threats to national security while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade competing demands for federal funds are pressuring various areas of spending defense investment accounts budgets for procurement and research and development remain under pressure decreases in us government defense spending including investment accounts or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which has occurred in recent years for example changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings 

government contractors are subject to audit by the us government  numerous us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor’s compliance with its internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting systems in some cases audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made in some cases audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements arbitration or litigation 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced materially as a result 

  

earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances estimates or assumptions or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margins materially 

earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law misconduct by subcontractors such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities may harm our future revenues and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues however we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities 

sales and operations outside the us are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our nonus business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities nonus transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our nonus business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our nonus business 

in addition some nonus government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy certain requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to establish joint ventures with local companies if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we were unable to develop new products that meet 

customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

business environment 

approximately 60 percent of our revenues are from the us government accordingly our financial performance is impacted by us government spending levels particularly defense spending over the past several years us defense spending has been reduced due in part to the country’s fiscal shortfalls following required reductions mandated by the budget control act of 2011 bca and its related sequester mechanism the bipartisan budget act of 2013 bba prescribed defense topline funding for fy 2014 and 2015 at levels generally consistent with fy 2013 the bba also included sequester reductions of approximately 30 billion in fy 2014 and 43 billion in fy 2015 less than the amounts imposed by the bca 

in adherence to the bba congress appropriated 497 billion in fy 2015 for the department of defense dod including approximately 158 billion for procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts relatively consistent with fy 2014 these investment accounts are the source of the majority of our us government revenues 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

we continue to pursue opportunities outside the us presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our nonus operations and through exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant these opportunities are subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country 

in our aerospace group businessjet market conditions were strong in 2014 the group benefited from strong order interest for new aircraft across the group’s range of customers and lower customer contract defaults we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the aerospace group’s longterm growth similarly we believe the aircraft services business will continue to be a strong source of revenues as the global businessjet fleet grows 

in navigating the current business environment we continue to focus on improving operating earnings expanding margins and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash through our emphasis on effective program execution and costreduction activities across the business 

results of operations 

introduction 

 an understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our operating results we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our aerospace and defense groups 

in the aerospace group contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors revenues associated with the group’s completions of other original equipment manufacturers’ oems aircraft and the group’s services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services fluctuations in revenues from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net rd costs incurred by the group 

in the defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or services are rendered as a result variations in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs yearoveryear variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor overhead and ga costs and are recognized generally as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 

operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared 

with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin work additionally higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



our revenues were virtually flat in 2014  compared with 2013  decreased us army spending continued to affect somewhat our information systems and technology and combat systems groups this was essentially offset by higher aerospace and marine systems revenues due to increased aircraft deliveries and higher ship construction activity respectively operating costs and expenses decreased more than revenues in 2014  resulting in increased operating earnings and margins the decrease in operating costs and expenses in 2014  was due to improved performance in aircraft manufacturing and outfitting activities in the aerospace group and significant cost reductions in the information systems and technology group the resulting consolidated operating margins of 126 percent  were up 70 basis points over 2013  reflecting strong operating performance across all of our groups 

review of 2013  vs 2012 



while our revenues were essentially flat in 2013  compared with 2012  operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013  we experienced lower volume in our combat systems business as a result of decreased us army spending this was largely offset by higher revenues in our aerospace group from increased deliveries of g650 and g280 aircraft revenues increased slightly in our marine systems and information systems and technology groups in 2013  operating costs were significantly lower in 2013  due to several discrete charges taken in 2012  including a 2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the information systems and technology group these charges are discussed in conjunction with our business groups’ operating results even absent the charges taken in 2012 operating costs were down in 2013 the effect of costreduction efforts and cost savings associated with restructuring activities 

review of business groups 



following is a discussion of the operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed by specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results additional information regarding our business groups can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2014  vs 2013   



the increase in the aerospace group’s revenues in 2014  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2014  primarily due to additional deliveries of largecabin aircraft aircraft services activity was higher in 2014  due to growth in the number of aircraft in service and the resulting increased demand for maintenance work we experienced reduced aircraft tradein activity in 2014  leading to lower preowned aircraft sales we had three preowned aircraft sales in 2014 compared to 11 in 2013  

the increase in the group’s operating earnings in 2014  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings grew in 2014  due to the increase in aircraft deliveries as well as improved operating performance on our large and midcabin aircraft production partially offsetting this increase was higher net rd expenses associated with ongoing productdevelopment efforts as a result the aerospace group’s operating margins increased 120  basis points in 2014  

review of 2013  vs 2012 



the aerospace group’s revenues and earnings increased in 2013  primarily due to additional deliveries of g650 and g280 aircraft operating earnings also increased in 2013  due to a 191 impairment of jet aviation’s maintenance business intangible asset in 2012   as the business experienced an increasingly competitive marketplace 

2015  outlook 

we expect an increase of approximately 8 percent in the group’s revenues in 2015  compared with 2014  as a result of gulfstream aircraft deliveries operating margins are expected to be around 18 percent down somewhat from 2014  primarily due to higher net rd expenses aircraft manufacturing mix and more preowned aircraft sales 

combat systems 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



the change in the combat systems group’s revenues in 2014  consisted of the following 



us military vehicle revenues were down in 2014  consistent with our expectations as a result of a decrease in us army spending as the iraqi and afghan conflicts wound down this impacted our primary us vehicle programs including stryker abrams buffalo and mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles revenues also decreased on the completed ground combat vehicle gcv design and development program weapons systems and munitions volume decreased in 2014  primarily due to lower tank ammunition production for nonus customers 

revenues for international military vehicles were up significantly in 2014  as work commenced on a 10 billion international order received in the first quarter work on this order was somewhat offset by lower revenues on several other international contracts that are nearing completion 

the combat systems groups operating margins decreased 60  basis points in 2014  primarily due to a mix shift from more mature programs nearing completion to the start up of new programs somewhat offsetting this shift in contract mix operating margins were up in our european and weapons systems businesses as a result of reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities completed in 2013 and early 2014 

review of 2013   vs 2012 



in 2013  revenues were down across the combat systems group decreased us army spending in part due to sequestration and a government shutdown impacted us military vehicle programs including stryker abrams and mrap and weapons systems and munitions programs 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013  despite the reduced revenues due to the negative impact of three discrete charges in 2012  in our european land systems business 

 these charges reduced the group’s 2012 operating margins approximately 570 basis points operating earnings and margins increased in 2013  due to strong operating performance across our us businesses and the favorable impact of cost savings associated with restructuring activities in our european military vehicles business 

2015  outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s revenues and margins in 2015  to be consistent with 2014  as growth on our international military vehicle contracts offsets some scheduled reductions in spending on a few us military production programs 

information systems and technology 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



the information systems and technology group’s revenues in 2014  were lower than 2013  though higher than our initial expectations the decrease from the prior year consisted of the following 



revenues decreased nearly 25 percent in the mobile communication systems business in 2014  primarily as a result of lower us army spending on certain programs including the handheld manpack and small form fit hms radio warfighter information networktactical wint and common hardware systems4 chs4 programs revenues decreased in 2014  in our it services business due to lower volume on several programs including our commercial wireless work this decrease was partially offset by increased contactcenter services work under our contract with the centers for medicare  medicaid services revenues were essentially flat in our isr business 

despite the revenue decline the groups operating margins increased 90  basis points in 2014  the result of solid operating performance and ongoing costreduction efforts across all our lines of business as part of these efforts we consolidated two businesses in the group effective in january of 2015 in an effort to be more efficient and responsive to our customers 

review of 2013  vs 2012 



the information systems and technology group’s revenues increased in 2013  compared with 2012  as higher volume in the mobile communication systems and it services businesses was partially offset by decreased revenues in the isr business revenues increased in 2013  in the mobile communication systems business due to higher volume on programs that received production awards in late 2012 or 2013 including wint hms and chs4 in the it services business revenues were up as we worked to meet   commercial wireless customers’ accelerated schedules and commenced work on the   contactcenter services contract discussed above revenues decreased in   2013   across the isr business driven by lower us defense spending and a slowerthanexpected transition to related followon work 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2013  driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges in 2012  

 excluding these charges operating margins decreased slightly in 2013  primarily due to growth in the lowermargin it services business and performance challenges in the group’s uk business management of the uk business was consolidated into our north american mobile communication systems business in 2013 

2015  outlook 

we expect 2015  revenues in the information systems and technology group to decrease approximately 55 percent from 2014  as some of 2014’s anticipated revenue reduction flows into 2015 operating margins are expected to improve again to slightly more than 9 percent 

marine systems 

review of 2014   vs   2013   



the increase in the marine systems group’s revenues in 2014  consisted of the following 



the group’s us navy ship construction programs include virginiaclass submarines ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyers and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships the increase in navy ship construction revenues in 2014 is primarily due to higher volume on the virginiaclass program including longlead materials for the block iv contract which was awarded in the second quarter of 2014  this increase was partially offset by lower volume on the mlp program as two of the four ships under contract have been delivered revenues for navy engineering repair and other services decreased in 2014  primarily due to lower spending by the navy on submarinerelated overhaul and repair services commercial ship construction revenues increased in 2014  as work ramped up on the groups construction of jones act ships all 10 commercial ships under contract are expected to be at various stages of construction by the end of 2015 

operating margins decreased 30  basis points in 2014  primarily due to a shift in contract mix as work on the block iv virginiaclass and jones act commercial ship contracts ramped up volume decreased on 

mature contracts including mlp and blocks ii and iii of the virginiaclass program and construction progressed on the first of the three ddg1000 ships and two of the ddg51 ships in the navy’s restart of the program 

review of 2013  vs 2012 



the marine systems group’s revenues increased in 2013  compared with 2012  as lower ship construction revenues were offset by higher revenues from engineering and repair programs for the navy and commercial ship construction the decrease in 2013 construction revenues was due to the completion of the take combatlogistics ship program in late 2012 however this decrease was partially offset by higher revenues on the virginiaclass program primarily due to longlead materials for the block iv contract revenues were higher on navy engineering and repair programs in 2013  due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work commercial ship construction revenues increased as work commenced on contracts for jones act ships secured in late 2012 and 2013 operating earnings and margins decreased in 2013  due to the completion of the mature highermargin take program in 2012 

2015  outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s 2015  revenues to increase 2 to 25 percent from 2014  primarily due to higher revenues on the virginiaclass program operating margins are expected to remain in the mid9 percent range 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate operating costs totaled 72  in 2014  96  in 2013   and 69  in 2012  we expect corporate operating costs in 2015  of approximately 65 to 70 

other information 

product and service revenues and operating costs 

review of 2014  vs 2013 



the increase in product revenues in 2014  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in 2014  due to additional deliveries of largecabin aircraft ship construction revenues increased due to higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine program and commercial jones act ships offsetting these increases lower us army spending negatively impacted revenues from mobile communication products preowned aircraft sales were down as there were fewer aircraft tradeins and resulting sales in 2014 

despite the 24 percent  increase in product revenues product operating costs rose only 18 percent  compared with 2013  due to strong operating performance the majority of the change in product operating costs was due to volume although costs in 2014  were affected by other changes including higher net rd expenses in the aerospace group associated with ongoing productdevelopment efforts no other changes were individually significant 



the decrease in service revenues in 2014  consisted of the following 



military vehicle and mobile communication support services revenues were lower due to decreased us army spending while it services revenues decreased due to reduced commercial wireless work 

service operating costs were lower in 2014  compared with 2013  as shown below the decrease in service operating costs was due to lower volume no other changes were individually significant 



review of 2013  vs 2012 



the decrease in product revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



in 2013  military vehicle production revenues decreased on several programs including the stryker abrams and mrap programs offsetting these decreases aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to additional deliveries of the g650 and g280 aircraft 

product operating costs were lower in 2013  compared with 2012  discrete charges totaling 289 in 2012 in the combat systems and information systems and technology business groups included 110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business 89 related to the termination of a contract to provide pandur vehicles to the portuguese government 58 of ruggedized hardware inventory writedowns for products that ceased production in 2012 and 32 for cost growth associated 

with the demonstration phase of the sv program for the uk ministry of defence excluding these charges the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume no other changes were individually significant 



the increase in service revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



ship engineering and repair revenues increased in 2013  due to submarine overhaul and repair work 

service operating costs were lower in 2013  compared with 2012  while ship engineering and repair cost volume increased this was offset by the intangible asset impairment in 2012 in jet aviation’s maintenance business no other changes were individually significant 



goodwill impairment 

in 2012  we recorded a 2 billion goodwill impairment in the information systems and technology group discussed in conjunction with the business group’s operating results 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenues ga expenses were 64 percent  in 2014    66 percent  in 2013  and 72 percent  in 2012  we expect ga expenses in 2015  to be generally consistent with 2014  

interest net 

net interest expense was 86  in 2014  and 2013  and 156  in 2012  the decrease in interest expense in 2013  results from our debt refinancing completed in december 2012 see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations we expect fullyear 2015  net interest expense to be 82 

other net 

in 2012  other expenses included a 123  loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above 

provision for income tax net 

our effective tax rate was 297 percent  in 2014  312 percent  in 2013  and 1805 percent  in 2012  the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2014  was primarily due to increased income from international operations and utilization of foreign tax credits the atypically high tax rate in 2012 was driven by the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment recorded in the information systems and technology group and to a lesser extent the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our nonus operations for further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note e to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we anticipate the fullyear effective tax rate to be approximately 305 percent  in 2015  

discontinued operations net of tax 

in 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our axle business in the combat systems group and recognized a 146 loss net of tax the sale was completed in january 2015 in 2013 we recognized a 129 loss net of tax from the settlement of our litigation with the us navy related to the terminated a12 contract in the company’s discontinued tactical military aircraft business see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of these transactions 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 724 billion  at the end of 2014  nearly 60 percent higher than the prioryear amount of 459 billion  on december 31 2014  our estimated potential contract value was 267 billion  compared to 276 billion  at the end of 2013  our total estimated contract value which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value was 991 billion  on december 31 2014  our highest yearend balance ever 

estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts idiq contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries 

or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace group ended 2014  with backlog of 132 billion  compared with 139 billion  at yearend 2013  

orders were up more than 15 percent compared to 2013 and included strong demand across our product portfolio our backlog included orders for an allnew family of business jets introduced in 2014 the g500 and g600 aircraft designed to optimize speed cabin comfort efficiency and industryleading safety technologies the aircraft are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019 respectively following type certification from the us federal aviation administration and european aviation safety agency 

despite strong orders in 2014 the group’s backlog has declined in recent years as g650 production has ramped up to fulfill the substantial orders we received upon introduction of the aircraft in 2008 we have approximately three years  of backlog for the g650 we expect backlog to continue to decrease over the next several years as the time period between customer order and delivery of the g650 aircraft normalizes at that time we expect order activity to more closely match deliveries 

estimated potential contract value in the aerospace group primarily represents options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers estimated potential contract value of 27 billion on december 31 2014 increased more than 60 percent from 17 billion at yearend 2013 the increase is largely due to new multiaircraft agreements in 2014 that include options for several gulfstream aircraft models 

demand for gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions generating orders from public and private companies individuals and governments around the world 

geographically nonus customers represented approximately 60 percent  of the group’s backlog on december 31 2014  

defense groups 

the total backlog in our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by nonus customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments we have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program 

total backlog in our defense groups was 592 billion  on december 31 2014  up more than 85 percent from 319 billion  at the end of 2013  due to major awards received in 2014 in our combat systems and marine systems groups detailed below estimated potential contract value was 239 billion on december 31 2014 compared to 259 billion at yearend 2013 

combat systems 

combat systems’ total backlog was 198 billion  at the end of 2014  tripling the yearend 2013  backlog of 66 billion  growth in the group’s backlog was primarily due to two major contract awards received in 2014 a 59 billion award from the uk ministry of defence to deliver specialist vehicle sv platforms to the british army between 2017 and 2024 and a 10 billion award to provide wheeled armored vehicles training and support services to an international customer through 2028 the wheeled vehicle contract also provides for an additional potential 3 billion of vehicles and services 

the combat systems group has several other significant nonus military vehicle production contracts in backlog including 

 

 the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 780 of the group’s backlog on december 31 2014  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2016 the group received 460 of stryker orders in 2014 including awards for doublevhulled vehicles contractor logistics support and engineering services the group’s backlog on december 31 2014  included 540 for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies around the world including 105 for m1a2 tanks for the kingdom of saudi arabia 

the combat systems group’s backlog on december 31 2014  also included 22 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs 

combat systems’ estimated potential contract value was 55 billion  on december 31 2014  up more than 50 percent  since yearend 2013  primarily due to the international wheeled vehicle contract discussed previously 

information systems and technology 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards the group’s total backlog was 86 billion  at the end of 2014  up slightly from 85 billion  at yearend 2013  this amount does not include 161 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2014 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed nearly 4 billion to the group’s orders 

the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2014  including the following 

 

 backlog at yearend 2014 also included the following key programs 

 marine systems   

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts backlog increased more than 80 percent from 169 billion  at the end of 2013  to 308 billion  on december 31 2014  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2014 and the largest contract in the company’s backlog in 2014  we received a contract for the construction of 10 submarines in block iv of the program the group’s backlog at year end included 21 billion for 17 virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023 

navy destroyer programs represented 46 billion of the group’s backlog at yearend 2014 we currently have construction contracts for seven ddg51 destroyers including one awarded in 2014 scheduled for delivery through 2022 backlog at year end also included three ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2019  

the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2014  included 560 for construction of mlp ships the group has delivered the first two ships in this program and received a 500 award in 2014 for 

procurement of a fourth ship construction is underway on the two additional ships scheduled for delivery in 2015 and 2018 the third and fourth ships are configured as afloat forward staging bases afsb 

the yearend backlog also included 880 for 10 liquefied natural gas lngpowered and lngconversionready jones act ships for commercial customers scheduled for delivery through 2017 

complementing these ship construction programs engineering services represented approximately 2 billion of the marine systems group’s backlog on december 31 2014  including 14 billion for design and development efforts on the ohioclass submarine replacement program additionally yearend backlog for maintenance repair and other services totaled 17 billion 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities the 94 billion  of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and fund capital expenditures our net cash position defined as cash and equivalents and marketable securities less debt was 1 billion  at yearend 2014  down 415  from the end of 2013  

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher on december 31 2014  19 billion  of our cash was held by nonus operations should this cash be repatriated it generally would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits 



 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows in item 8 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 37 billion  in 2014  31 billion  in 2013   and   26 billion  in 2012  in all three years the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings loss after removing the impact of noncash charges operating cash flows in 2014 included significant customer deposits related to a large nonus contract awarded in our combat systems group as these deposits are utilized to fund supplier commitments on the program we expect operating cash flows to be less operating cash flows in 

2013 benefited from reductions in operating working capital primarily in our marine systems group where deposits were received for commercial ship orders 

investing activities 

we used 11 billion  in 2014  363  in 2013   and   642  in 2012  for investing activities the primary uses of cash for investing activities were capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 521  in 2014  436  in 2013  and 2012  we expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent  of revenues in 2015  

marketable securities in 2014  we purchased 500 of shortterm heldtomaturity securities other net purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material 

other net  investing activities also include proceeds from the sale of assets and cash paid for business acquisitions we completed one acquisition in 2014 no acquisitions in 2013  and seven acquisitions in 2012  for 444 we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of acquisition activity 

financing activities 

we used 36 billion  in 2014  725  in 2013  and 14 billion  in 2012  for financing activities our financing activities include repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and debt issuances and repayments net cash from financing activities also included proceeds received from stock option exercises 

share repurchases  we repurchased 29 million  of our outstanding shares in 2014  114 million of the shares were repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase program 94 million  shares in 2013  and 91 million  shares in 2012  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 7 percent  since the end of 2011 on december 31 2014  24 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase less than 1 percent of our total shares outstanding 

dividends  on march 5 2014  our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 062  per share the 17 th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 056  per share in march 2013  and 051  per share in march 2012  we did not pay any dividends in the first three months of 2013 because we made our first quarter dividend payment in december 2012 

debt proceeds net  in 2012  we issued 24 billion of fixedrate notes and used the proceeds to redeem prior to maturity an equal amount of fixedrate notes with higher interest rates 

in january 2015 we repaid 500 of fixedrate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities purchased in 2014  see discussion above we have no additional material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until 2016 see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates 

we ended 2014  with no  commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion  in bank credit facilities that remain available including a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2016  and a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2018  these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not defined operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for shareholders because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



 not meaningful nm due to net loss in 2012 

return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for shareholders because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year roic excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss goodwill impairments and noneconomic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance prioryear amounts have been adjusted for comparative purposes to reflect our current definition 

roic is calculated as follows 

  



2012 loss from continuing operations of 381 has been adjusted for 1994 goodwill impairment and associated 199 tax benefit 2012 shareholders’ equity a component of average invested capital has been similarly adjusted 

additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2014  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2014  

  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 246 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results could differ from 

these estimates we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue recognition  we account for revenues and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered we determine progress using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review our performance monthly and update our contractrelated estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events and circumstances 

we recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under this method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our longterm contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catchup method the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catchup method the net increase in our operating 

earnings and on a pershare basis from the impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled favorable changes in estimate of 184   035  in 2014  351   065  in 2013  and 180   033  in 2012  the 2013  impact of changes in estimate was higher as a result of numerous programs that neared completion in the combat systems group no revisions on any one contract were material to our consolidated financial statements in 2014  

in the second quarter of 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap the standard outlines a fivestep model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied the standard also requires new expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition asu 201409 is effective in the first quarter of 2017 early application is not permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements 

the required adoption of the asu in 2017 will preclude our use of the reallocation method of recognizing revisions in estimated profit on contracts discussed above as changes in estimated profit will be recognized in the period they are identified cumulative catchup method rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term we expect that the impact of revisions of contract estimates may be larger and potentially more variable from period to period anticipated losses on contracts will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified 

goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2014  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are consistent with our business groups the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units were well in excess of their respective carrying values as of december 31 2014  in our information systems and technology reporting unit for which we recorded a 2 billion  goodwill impairment in 2012  this excess increased from 2013  as there was an improvement in the fair value and a decrease in the carrying value of the reporting unit 

we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable impairment losses where identified are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the longlived asset we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows 

commitments and contingencies  we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs  certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans  our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates the key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 

in 2014  we adopted updated mortality tables published by the society of actuaries that predict increasing life expectancies in the united states additionally we updated several other assumptions to align them with historical experience including rates of retirement and cost of living increases the impact of these changes was a net increase of 566  and 28  in the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively on december 31 2014  

these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event any of the assumptions change pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency  we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of 91 billion  on december 31 2014  and 17 billion  on december 31 2013  the increase in 2014 is due to significant international contract awards a 10 percent  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax losses 



this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar eurocanadian dollar and eurobritish pound exchange rates while the hypothetical pretax losses in the table above have increased significantly from 2013 we do not believe this represents a meaningful increase in our risk profile as these losses would continue to be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2014  we had 39 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2014  we held 44 billion  in cash and equivalents and 500  of marketable securities reported in other current assets

the group is wellpositioned to continue meeting the needs of our diverse customer base we are continuing to improve performance across the portfolio by optimizing the size of the business while developing innovative solutions to meet evolving customer requirements 

revenues for the information systems and technology group were 34 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2011  32 percent  in 2012  and 33 percent  in 2013  revenues by major products and services were as follows 



  

customers 

in 2013  62 percent  of our revenues were from the us government 18 percent  were from us commercial customers 7 percent  were from international defense customers and the remaining 13 percent  were from international commercial customers 

us government 

our primary customer is the us department of defense dod we also contract with other us government customers including the intelligence community the departments of homeland security and health and human services and firstresponder agencies our revenues from the us government were as follows 



 in addition to our direct international sales we sell to foreign governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the foreign government customer 

we perform our us government business under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed fee or an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for material costs 

fixedprice contracts accounted for 56 percent  of our us government business in 2012  and 54 percent  in 2013  costreimbursement contracts accounted for 39 percent  in 2012  and 42 percent  in 2013  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for 5 percent  in 2012  and 4 percent  in 2013  

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels as we assume more risks such as any cost overruns under our control these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk accordingly the negotiated base fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixedprice contracts costreimbursement contracts also can include fee provisions that can require the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy specific performance criteria additionally not all costs are allowable under these types of contracts and the government reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates also because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs the content mix can impact profit margins 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 38 billion  in 2011  42 billion  in 2012  and 56 billion  in 2013  this represented approximately 12 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2011  13 percent  in 2012  and 18 percent  in 2013  the majority of these revenues are for businessjet aircraft and services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries 

international 

our direct revenues from nonus government and commercial customers were 63 billion  in 2011  65 billion  in 2012  and 64 billion  in 2013  this represented approximately 19 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2011  21 percent  in 2012  and 20 percent  in 2013  

we conduct business with government customers around the world with operations in australia brazil canada france germany mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our international commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from international customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately 65 percent  of total backlog on december 31 2013  

for a discussion of the risks associated with conducting business in international locations see risk factors contained herein for information regarding revenues and assets by geographic region see note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for products and services we compete against other largeplatform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers based in the countries where we operate our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the 

program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on the team or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in its maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in its completions business the group competes with other oems as well as several thirdparty providers 

  

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

  



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our companysponsored rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from 

others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2013  we and our subsidiaries had 96000  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 5 percent  of total employees are due to expire in 2014  historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not generally seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its octobertoseptember fiscal year internationally work for many of our government customers is weighted toward the end of the calendar year 

  

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

available information 

we file several types of reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763583

 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenues  in each of the past three years approximately twothirds  of our revenues were from the us government us defense spending is driven by threats to national security while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade competing demands for federal funds are pressuring various areas of spending defense investment accounts budgets for procurement and research and development remain under pressure decreases in us government defense spending including investment accounts or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance 

for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay  our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which has occurred during the past few years for example changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prioryear levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

our us government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings 

government contractors are subject to audit by the us government  us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor’s compliance with its internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating labor accounting and information systems in some cases audits may result in contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the   businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be materially reduced as a result 

  

earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform on our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events these projections and estimates assess 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margins materially 

earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer problems however we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations may be adversely affected if one or more of these 

suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems our international business is subject to us and foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to importexport controls technology transfers the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anticorruption laws and the international traffic in arms regulations itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with us or foreign laws could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our international business 

in addition some international government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements we may also be required to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy certain requirements or face penalties offset requirements may extend over several years and require us to establish joint ventures with local companies if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired  goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and 

intangible assets acquired goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges including changes in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future writeoffs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition

business environment 

more than 60 percent of our revenues are from the us government accordingly our financial performance is impacted by us government spending levels particularly defense spending over the past several years us defense spending has been reduced due in part to the country’s fiscal shortfall to address this shortfall the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated a 487 billion  or 8 percent  reduction to previouslyplanned defense funding over 10 years the bca also included a mechanism referred to as the sequester that can impose additional defense cuts of up to 500 billion  or 9 percent  over nine years starting in fiscal year fy 2013 

the bipartisan budget act of 2013 bba prescribed defense topline funding for fy 2014 and 2015 at levels generally consistent with fy 2013 reducing budget uncertainties and providing nearterm stability the bba also included sequester reductions of approximately 30 billion in fy 2014 and 43 billion in fy 2015 less than the amounts imposed by the bca 

in adherence to the bba congress appropriated 497 billion in fy 2014 for the department of defense dod including approximately 156 billion for procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts relatively consistent with fy 2013 these investment accounts are the source of the majority of our us government revenues 

the longterm outlook for our us defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the us military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

we continue to pursue opportunities outside the us presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our international operations and through exports from our north american businesses while the revenue potential can be significant our work for these customers is subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures as well as timing of contract awards 

in our aerospace group businessjet market conditions were strong in 2013 the group benefited from improved order interest across the group’s range of customers and lower customer contract defaults we expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support aerospace’s longterm growth similarly we believe aircraftservice revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by the global installed businessjet fleet 

results of operations 

introduction 

 an understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our operating results we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our aerospace and defense groups 

in the aerospace group contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s other original equipment manufacturers oems completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor material and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net rd costs incurred by the group 

in the defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or services are rendered as a result changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs yearoveryear variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor overhead and ga costs and are recognized generally as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 

operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the value of that contract that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin 

work additionally higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 

review of 2012  vs 2013    



our revenues were essentially flat in 2013  compared with 2012  despite a challenging business environment that included a 16day partial us government shutdown we experienced lower volume in our combat systems business as a result of decreased us army spending and delays in international orders this was largely offset by higher revenues in our aerospace group from increased deliveries of g650 and g280 aircraft revenues increased slightly in our marine systems and information systems and technology groups in 2013  operating costs were lower in 2013  due to several discrete charges in 2012  most significantly a 2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the information systems and technology group these charges are discussed below in conjunction with our business groups’ operating results operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013  due to improved operating performance 

review of 2011  vs 2012   



our revenues decreased in 2012  compared with 2011  due to lower volume in the information systems and technology group’s mobile communication systems business and on several european wheeled vehicle contracts in the combat systems group these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in the aerospace group due to increased deliveries of g650 aircraft operating costs increased in 2012  due to the discrete charges referenced above resulting in lower operating earnings and margins 

review of business groups 



following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results information regarding our business groups also can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

aerospace 

review of 2012  vs 2013   



the increase in the aerospace group’s revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2013  primarily due to additional deliveries of g650 and g280 aircraft production rates for these aircraft have been ramping up since their initial green deliveries in 2011 and 2012 respectively preowned aircraft sales increased as we sold 11 aircraft in 2013  as compared to three in 2012  the group had one preowned aircraft available for sale on december 31 2013 

the increase in the group’s operating earnings in 2013  consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings increased in 2013  primarily due to the increase in aircraft deliveries discussed above in addition to improved performance aircraft services earnings increased in 2013  primarily due to the impairment charge taken in 2012  discussed below in the completions and maintenance businesses jet aviation made positive contributions throughout 2013 following actions to reduce costs and improve operational processes 

review of 2011  vs 2012   



the aerospace group’s revenues and operating earnings increased in 2012  primarily due to increased green deliveries of g650 aircraft which began in the fourth quarter of 2011 losses in jet aviation’s completions business in 2011 included a 111 impairment of the completions business intangible asset and 78 of project losses while 2012 was negatively impacted by a 191 impairment of the maintenance business intangible assets during 2011 and 2012 jet aviation’s completions and maintenance businesses suffered from an increasingly competitive marketplace and performance issues 

2014  outlook 

with continued growth in deliveries of newer gulfstream aircraft models we expect an increase of approximately 11 percent  in the group’s revenues in 2014  compared with 2013  operating margins are expected to be around 17 percent  

combat systems 

review of 2012  vs 2013   



the decrease in the combat systems group’s revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



in 2013  revenues were down as a result of decreased us army spending in part due to sequestration and the government shutdown this impacted us military vehicle programs including stryker abrams and mineresistant ambushprotected mrap and weapons systems and munitions including axles hydra70 rockets guns and ammunition in addition revenues in the group’s european military vehicles business were down slightly due to final vehicle deliveries in 2012 on duro and eagle wheeled vehicle contracts for the swiss and german governments respectively 

in response to decreased customer spending and to align our business with anticipated future demand we implemented cost reduction initiatives in 2013 throughout the group we reduced headcount by more than 25 percent in our us and european military vehicles businesses additionally we consolidated our weapons systems and munitions businesses our actions are intended to help us remain competitively positioned for the future while creating opportunities for margin improvement 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2013  primarily due to the 2012 discrete charges in our european military vehicles business discussed below that reduced the group’s operating margins approximately 530 basis points operating earnings and margins also increased 120 basis points in 2013 due to strong performance across our us businesses and the favorable impact of cost savings associated with restructuring activities in our european military vehicles business 

review of 2011  vs 2012   



the combat systems group’s revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to lower volume in the group’s european military vehicles and weapons systems and munitions businesses in the group’s european military vehicles business revenues were down in 2012 on contracts with various international customers that were nearing completion including contracts for piranha duro and eagle vehicles volume was down across several us armament and munitions programs in 2012 due to slowed defense spending including vehicle armor mk47 grenade launchers and hydra70 rockets the sale of the detection systems business in the second  quarter of 2011  also resulted in lower revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business in 2012 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012  due to the negative impact of three discrete charges in our european military vehicles business 

 2014  outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s revenues in 2014  to decrease 4 to 45 percent from 2013  with operating margins approximating 14 percent our outlook assumes approximately 12 billion in revenues from an international order expected in the first quarter of 2014 

marine systems 

review of 2012  vs 2013   



the increase in the marine systems group’s revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



the group’s us navy shipconstruction programs include virginiaclass submarines ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyers and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships the decrease in 2013 construction revenues is due to the completion of the take combatlogistics ship program in late 2012 partially offsetting this decrease revenues increased on the virginiaclass program primarily due to longlead material for the initial boats on the next block of submarines revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the navy in 2013  due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work commercial ship construction revenues increased as work commenced on contracts for jones act ships secured in late 2012 and 2013 

operating earnings and margins decreased in 2013 due to the completion of the mature highermargin take program in 2012 excluding the impact of this program operating margins improved in 2013  

review of 2011  vs 2012   



revenues in the marine systems group decreased slightly in 2012  as lower navy ship construction revenues were largely offset by higher revenues on engineering and repair programs for the navy decreased navy ship construction revenues on the virginiaclass and the take programs were partially offset by an increase on the mlp and ddg programs higher revenues on navy engineering and repair programs were driven by the acquisition of two east coast surfaceship repair operations and higher volume on the ohioclass replacement engineering program 

despite the decline in revenues the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2012  increases in the take profit rate contributed 53 to the operating earnings growth approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction and delivery of the final ship 

2014  outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s 2014  revenues to increase 25 percent from 2013  with operating margins approximating 95 percent 

information systems and technology 

review of 2012  vs 2013   



the increase in the information systems and technology group’s revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



revenues increased in 2013  in the mobile communication systems business due to higher volume on key programs that received significant production awards in late 2012 or 2013 including the warfighter information networktactical wint handheld manpack and small formfit hms and common hardware systems4 chs4 programs the it services business added more than 8000 employ ees throughout the year to meet commercial wireless customers’ accelerated schedules for it infrastructure services and to start work on a contract to provide contactcenter services for the centers for medicare  medicaid services resulting in increased revenues in   2013  revenues decreased in   2013   across the isr business driven by lower us defense spending and a slowerthanexpected transition to related followon work 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2013  due to several discrete charges taken in 2012 discussed below excluding these charges operating margins decreased slightly in 2013  primarily due to growth in the lowermargin it services business and performance challenges in the group’s uk business the uk business was consolidated into our north american mobile communication systems business in 2013 

review of 2011  vs 2012   



the information systems and technology group’s revenues were down in 2012  compared with 2011  driven primarily by lower revenues in the mobile communication systems business revenues in this business were impacted unfavorably by slowed defense spending and protracted us customer acquisition cycles this resulted in lower revenues in 2012  on key programs including wint and chs and in encryption and ruggedized hardware products in addition more than 10 percent of the decline in the group’s revenues 

was due to lower volume on the ukbased bowman communication system program which was fielded successfully and moved into maintenance and longterm support 

operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012  compared with 2011  driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges 

 2014  outlook 

we expect 2014  revenues in the information systems and technology group to decrease nearly 20 percent  from 2013  largely due to award delays and slowed defense spending on major production programs in the mobile communication systems business operating margins are expected to be in the low8 percent range 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate operating costs totaled 77  in 2011  69  in 2012  and 96  in 2013  we expect 2014  corporate operating costs of approximately 85  

other information 

product and service revenues and operating costs 

review of 2012 vs 2013 



the decrease in product revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



in 2013  military vehicle production revenues decreased on several programs including the stryker abrams and mrap programs weapons systems and munitions production revenues decreased due to lower us army spending on axles hydra70 rockets guns and ammunition offsetting these decreases aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to additional deliveries of the new g650 and g280 aircraft 

product operating costs were lower in 2013  compared with 2012  discrete charges in 2012 are discussed below excluding these charges the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume no other changes were individually significant 



the increase in service revenues in 2013  consisted of the following 



ship engineering and repair revenues increased in 2013  due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work 

service operating costs were lower in 2013  compared with 2012  due to the intangible asset impairment in 2012 discussed below excluding this impairment service operating costs increased primarily due to higher volume no other changes were individually significant 



review of 2011 vs 2012 



the decrease in product revenues in 2012  consisted of the following 



in 2012  mobile communication products revenues decreased due to slowed defense spending and protracted us customer acquisition cycles lower european vehicle production revenues were largely due to several contracts nearing completion and the revenue impact of the termination of the contract to provide pandur vehicles to the portuguese government ship construction revenues decreased due to the completion of the take combatlogistics ship program and timing of activity on the virginiaclass submarine program aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues were higher due to increased deliveries of g650 aircraft 

product operating costs were lower in 2012  compared with 2011  as shown below the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume discrete charges discussed in conjunction with the combat systems and information systems and technology 2012 business groups’ operating results included 110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business 89 related to the termination of the contract to provide pandur vehicles to the portuguese government 58 of ruggedized hardware inventory writedowns for products that ceased production in 2012 and 32 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the sv program for the uk ministry of defence the 2011 intangible asset impairment in jet aviation’s completions business is discussed in conjunction with the aerospace business group’s operating results no other changes were individually significant 



the increase in service revenues in 2012  consisted of the following 



in 2012  the increase in ship engineering and repair revenues was driven by the acquisition of two east coast surfaceship repair operations and higher volume on the ohioclass replacement engineering program mobile communication support revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to higher maintenance and longterm support activity on the ukbased bowman communication system program 

service operating costs were higher in 2012  compared with 2011  as shown below the increase in service operating costs was primarily due to higher volume the 2012 intangible asset impairment in jet aviation’s maintenance business is discussed in conjunction with the aerospace business group’s operating results no other changes were individually significant 



goodwill impairment 

in 2012  we recorded a 2 billion goodwill impairment in the information systems and technology group discussed in conjunction with the business group’s operating results 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenues ga expenses were 62 percent  in 2011  72 percent  in 2012  and 67 percent  in 2013  ga expenses in 2012 and 2013 were negatively impacted by restructuringrelated charges in our european military vehicles business we expect ga expenses in 2014  to be approximately 65 percent  of revenues 

interest net 

net interest expense was 141  in 2011  156  in 2012  and 86  in 2013  the decrease in interest expense from 2012  results from our debt refinancing completed in december 2012 that lowered the weightedaverage interest rate on our outstanding debt from 39 percent  to 22 percent  see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations we expect fullyear 2014  net interest expense to be approximately 90  

other net 

in 2012  other expense included a 123  loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above in 2011  other income consisted primarily of a 38 gain from the sale of a business in our combat systems group 

provision for income taxes net 

our effective tax rate was 314 percent  in 2011  1614 percent  in 2012  and 311 percent  in 2013  the significant increase in 2012 was primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment of 2 billion recorded in the information systems and technology group and to a lesser extent the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our international operations for further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note e to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 305 to 31 percent  in 2014  

discontinued operations 

in 2013 we recognized a 129 loss net of taxes from the settlement of the a12 litigation with the us navy see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of the a12 settlement in 2011  we recognized a 13 loss net of taxes in discontinued operations from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company we also increased our estimate of the legal costs associated with the a12 litigation as a result of the us supreme court’s decision in that year that extended the timeline associated with the litigation resulting in a 13 loss net of taxes for a combined loss in discontinued operations of 26 in 2011  

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 46 billion  at the end of 2013  compared with 513 billion  at yearend 2012  

our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value idiq contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order on december 31 2013  estimated potential contract value associated with idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 276 billion  up 3 percent from 269 billion  at the end of 2012  we expect to realize this value over the next several years 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services the aerospace group finished 2013  with a total backlog of 139 billion  down from 157 billion  at yearend 2012  the group’s backlog has declined in recent years as we ramped up g650 production to work off the substantial orders we received upon introduction of the aircraft in 2008 

orders were up significantly compared to 2012 and included strong demand across our product portfolio estimated potential contract value increased 17 billion associated with international orders received in 2013 

the group’s customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions at yearend 2013 private companies and individuals collectively represented approximately 60 percent  of the group’s backlog geographically 65 percent  of the group’s backlog was comprised of international customers on december 31 2013  

we balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize delivery levels over time this has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our g450 and g550 largecabin aircraft we have approximately four years  of backlog for the g650 backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as the time period between customer order and delivery of the g650 aircraft normalizes at that time we expect order activity to more closely match deliveries 

defense groups 

the total backlog in our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding total backlog in our defense groups was 321 billion  on december 31 2013  compared with 356 billion  at the end of 2012  

combat systems 

combat systems’ total backlog was 67 billion  at the end of 2013  compared with 87 billion  at yearend 2012  due to delays in international orders and slowed us army spending 

the group’s backlog on december 31 2013  included 12 billion for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies around the world in 2013 the group received awards totaling 435 for all abramsrelated programs 

the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 1 billion of the group’s backlog at december 31 2013  with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2015 the group received 620 of stryker orders in 2013 including awards for 96 doublevhulled vehicles contractor logistics support and engineering services the group received a 230 order in 2013 for research development and testing in preparation for the stryker engineering change proposal ecp upgrade program 

  the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog the backlog at the end of the year included 

 the combat systems group’s backlog at year end also included 22 billion for weapons systems and munitions programs 

combat systems’ estimated potential contract value of 37 billion  increased approximately 30 percent  since yearend 2012  primarily due to an idiq award for the new ground mobility vehicle gmv 

marine systems   

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts backlog has decreased slightly to 169 billion  at yearend 2013  compared to 171 billion  at the end of 2012  

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2013 and is the largest contract in the company’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 69 billion for eight virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2018 we received 330 of advanced funding in 2013 for longlead materials for submarines in the next block of the program and anticipate being awarded a contract for construction in 2014 

navy destroyer programs represented 49 billion of the group’s backlog at yearend 2013 we currently have construction contracts for six ddg51 destroyers including four awarded in 2013 scheduled for delivery through 2022 backlog at year end also includes three ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2018  

the marine systems group’s backlog at december 31 2013  included 250 for the mlp program in 2013 the group delivered the first ship in the program and construction is underway on the remaining two 

ships scheduled for delivery in 2014 and 2015 the navy’s shipbuilding plan includes procurement of a fourth ship in 2014 the third and fourth ships will be configured as afloat forward staging bases afsb 

the yearend backlog also included 11 billion for nine jones act ships for commercial customers including contracts for seven ships secured in 2013 scheduled for delivery through 2017 

in addition to these construction programs the marine systems group’s backlog at december 31 2013  included approximately 37 billion for engineering repair overhaul and other services design and development efforts on the ohioclass submarine replacement engineering program totaled 17 billion yearend backlog for maintenance and repair services totaled 12 billion

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards the information systems and technology group’s total backlog was 85 billion  at the end of 2013  compared to 98 billion  at yearend 2012  the group’s backlog does not include approximately 191 billion  of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2013 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 41 billion to the group’s orders 

the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2013  including the following 

 

 backlog at yearend 2013 also included the following key programs 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities the 9 billion  of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock and pay dividends our net cash defined as cash and equivalents less debt was 14 billion  at yearend 2013  up 2 billion  from the end of 2012  

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher on december 31 2013  11 billion  of our cash was held by international operations while we do not intend to do so should this cash be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits 



 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 32 billion  in 2011  27 billion  in 2012  and 31 billion  in 2013  in all three years the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings loss after removing the impact of noncash charges operating cash flows in 2013 were favorably impacted by reductions in operating working capital owc primarily in our marine systems business group from deposits associated with orders received in 2013 for commercial ships cash from operating activities includes contributions to our pension plans which have grown from 350  in 2011  to 600  in 2013  with contributions of approximately 550  expected in 2014  

investing activities 

we used 2 billion  in 2011  656  in 2012  and 367  in 2013  for investing activities the primary uses of cash for investing activities were capital expenditures and acquisitions 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 458  in 2011  450  in 2012  and 440  in 2013  we expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent  of anticipated revenues in 2014  including ongoing work on gulfstream’s savannah georgia facilities project announced in 2010 

business acquisitions  we did not complete any acquisitions in 2013  we completed 13 acquisitions in 2011  and 2012  totaling 2 billion we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of acquisition activity 

marketable securities we held no marketable securities on december 31 2013  in 2012 to bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment we received cash of 219 from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities including 211 from the sale of heldtomaturity securities 

other net  investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of the detection systems business in our combat systems group in 2011 

financing activities 

we used 12 billion  in 2011  14 billion  in 2012  and 725  in 2013  for financing activities our primary financing activities included repurchases of common stock payment of dividends and issuances and repayments of debt net cash from financing activities also included proceeds received from stock option exercises 

share repurchases  we repurchased 20 million  shares on the open market in 2011  91 million  shares in 2012  and 94 million  shares in 2013  as a result we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5 percent  since 2010 

on january 24 2014 we repurcha sed 114 million shares of our common stock  for 12 billi on under an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution on february 5 2014 with shares from the prior authorization exhausted by the asr program the board of directors authorized management to repurchase 20 million additional shares of common stock on the open market approximately 6 percent of our total shares outstanding   

dividends  on march 6 2013  our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 056  per share – the 16 th consecutive annual increase previously the board had increased the quarterly dividend to 051  per share in march 2012  and 047  per share in march 2011  we did not pay any dividends in the first three months of 2013 because we made our first quarter 2013 dividend payment in december 2012 

debt proceeds net  in 2011  we issued 15 billion  of fixedrate notes and used the proceeds to repay 750 of maturing fixedrate notes in 2012  we issued 24 billion of fixedrate notes and used the proceeds 

to redeem prior to maturity an equal amount of fixedrate notes with higher interest rates we have no material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until 2015 see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities 

we ended 2013  with no  commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion  in bank credit facilities that remain available including a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2016  and a 1 billion  facility expiring in july 2018  these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program we also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to access the capital markets 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe these metrics provide useful information they are not operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year excluding any change in accumulated other comprehensive loss net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings loss from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic is calculated as follows 

  



additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2013  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2013  

  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note j to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 111 billion  of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note n to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft tradein options 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively 

those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue recognition  we account for revenues and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered we determine progress using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events and circumstances 

we recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under this method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term 

we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our longterm contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catchup method the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catchup method the net increase in our operating earnings and on a pershare basis from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled 356   063  in 2011  180   033  in 2012  and 351   065  in 2013  while no revisions on any one contract were material to our consolidated financial statements in 2013  the amount increased from 2012  largely due to improved performance in the combat systems group 

goodwill and intangible assets  since 1995 we have acquired more than 65  businesses at a total cost of approximately 23 billion  we have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions 

we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2013 the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values our reporting units are consistent with our business groups for our aerospace combat systems and marine systems reporting units the estimated fair values were at least double their respective carrying values the fair value of our information systems and technology reporting unit for which we recorded a 2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012 exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 15 percent while the projected cash flows have not changed materially from 2012 the book value of the reporting unit has increased largely due to improvement in the funded status of the unit’s definedbenefit retirement plans the reporting unit remains at risk for a future goodwill impairment should there be further significant increases in the carrying value of the reporting unit or deterioration in the projected cash flows uncertainties in future defense spending remain in the current business environment and could impact projected cash flows for the reporting unit 

we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable impairment losses 

where identified are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the longlived asset we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows as a result of lower revenues throughout 2013 we reviewed the longlived assets of our axle business in the combat systems group for recoverability the margin by which the expected cash flows of the business exceeded its carrying value was approximately 10 percent if future cash flows do not support the recovery of the business’ assets we will be required to impair some or all of the longlived assets including specifically identified intangible assets of 175 

commitments and contingencies  we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs  certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans  our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk  we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of 25 billion  on december 31 2012  and 17 billion  on december 31 2013  a 10 percent  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses 



this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar euroswiss franc and eurocanadian dollar exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2013  we had 39 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2013  we held 53 billion  in cash and equivalents but no marketable securities

the group’s three principal markets continue to be driven by the expanding needs of our diverse customer base including improved mobile communications and realtime intelligence it network and business system consolidation and modernization cyber security services and emergency response systems and services 

revenues for the information systems and technology group were 36 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2010  34 percent  in 2011  and 32 percent  in 2012  revenues by major products and services were as follows 



  

customers 

in 2012  66 percent  of our revenues were from the us government 13 percent  were from us commercial customers 8 percent  were from international defense customers and the remaining 13 percent  were from international commercial customers 

us government 

our primary customers are the us department of defense dod and intelligence community we also contract with other us government customers including the department of homeland security department of health and human services centers for medicare  medicaid services and several firstresponder agencies our revenues from the us government were as follows 



 in addition to our direct international sales we sell to foreign governments through the fms program under the fms program we contract with and are paid by the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the foreign government customer 

we perform our us government business under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed fee or an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for material costs 

fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 55 percent  of our us government business in 2011  and 56 percent  in 2012  costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 38 percent  in 2011  and 39 percent  in 2012  and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent  in 2011  and 5 percent  in 2012  

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels as we assume more risks such as any cost overruns under our control these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk accordingly the negotiated base fees are usually lower than on fixedprice contracts costreimbursement contracts also can include fee provisions that allow the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy specific performance criteria additionally not all costs are allowable under these types of contracts and the government carefully reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates additionally because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs the content mix can impact the profit margins 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 32 billion  in 2010  38 billion  in 2011  and 42 billion  in 2012  this represented approximately 10 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2010  12 percent  in 2011  and 13 percent  in 2012  the majority of these revenues are for businessjet aircraft and services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries other commercial products include drivetrain components and aftermarket parts in our combat systems group jones act ships in our marine systems group and a variety of products and services in our information systems and technology group 

international 

our direct revenues from government and commercial customers outside the united states were 6 billion  in 2010  63 billion  in 2011  and 65 billion  in 2012  this represented approximately 18 percent  of our consolidated revenues in 2010  19 percent  in 2011  and 21 percent  in 2012  

we conduct business with government customers around the world with primary subsidiary operations in australia brazil canada france germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our international commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years particularly in emerging markets while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from international customers represent a growing segment of our aircraft business with approximately 60 percent  of total backlog in 2012  

for a discussion of the risks associated with conducting business in international locations see risk factors contained in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding revenues and assets by geographic region see note q to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

defense market competition 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers based in the countries where we operate our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the 

program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on the team or as a provider of a specific program component or subsystem element 

businessjet aircraft market competition 

the aerospace group has several competitors for each of its gulfstream products with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe that gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in its maintenance repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in its completions business the group competes with other oems as well as thirdparty providers 

  

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

  



research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our us defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under government contracts and companysponsored rd in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2012  we and our subsidiaries had 92200  employees approximately onefifth  of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 6 percent  of total employees are due to expire in 2013  historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not generally seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle internationally work for many of our government customers is weighted toward the end of the calendar year generally resulting in increasing revenues and earnings over the course of the year 

  

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the dod implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai the european aviation safety agency easa and the civil aviation administration of china caac for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

available information 

we file several types of reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these reports and information include an annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and proxy statements free copies of these items are made available on our website wwwgeneraldynamicscom as soon as practicable and through the general dynamics investor relations office at 703 8763583

 item 1a  risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

because three of our four business groups serve the defense market our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves some specific risks in addition our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the us government provides a significant portion of our revenues  in each of the past three years approximately twothirds of our revenues were from the us government us defense spending is driven by threats to national security while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade competing demands for federal funds could pressure all areas of spending a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated which could have some impact on our financial performance 

several factors are currently affecting us defense spending including 

 

while we are unable to predict the exact impact on our programs or financial outlook these factors particularly the funding reductions of the magnitude imposed by the sequester mechanism as written could in the aggregate have material adverse operational and financial consequences depending on how the cuts are allocated across the budget due to its shortercycle businesses the information systems and technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget cuts that may occur for additional information relating to the us defense budget see the business environment section of 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and are subject to termination  our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted for example changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a cr that maintains spending at prior year levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards second the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings 

government contractors are subject to audit by the us government  us government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor’s compliance with its internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating labor accounting and information systems in some cases audits may result in contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft  our aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the group’s results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets in addition if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be materially reduced as a result 

  

earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts  when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess 

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected this could affect our earnings and margins materially 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance  we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer problems however we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to different and sometimes greater risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries  in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets leadership and national priorities including the current european fiscal condition international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our international business in addition some international government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit performance or surety bonds bank guarantees and other similar arrangements or to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets that require us to satisfy certain requirements if we do not satisfy these requirements our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers  many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties  when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results including future impairment charges 

our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions  as a defense contractor we face various cyber security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information as well as threats to physical security we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own accordingly we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems if any of these threats were to materialize the event could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for us government customers as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially

business environment 

as approximately twothirds of our revenues are from the us government our financial performance is impacted by the level of us defense spending currently the us government including the department of defense dod is operating under a continuing resolution cr that provides funding at fiscal year fy 2012 levels through march 2013 a cr does not generally fund new program starts or new multiyear contracts a series of crs over the past several years has negatively impacted the flow of contract awards particularly in our shortercycle information systems and technology business group 

while us military budgets are generally driven by national security requirements the country’s current fiscal shortfall is negatively influencing defense spending the budget control act of 2011 bca mandated a 487 billion or approximately 8 percent reduction to previouslyplanned defense funding over the next decade these cuts were incorporated into the fy 2013 proposed defense budget in addition the bca included a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional 500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fy 2013 which represents approximately 9 percent of planned defense funding over the period if sequestration is triggered the fy 2013 defense budget could be lowered by as much as 40 to 50 billion or approximately 9 percent however how these reductions would be implemented has not been defined congress recently extended the deadline for resolving sequestration to march 1 2013 as of february 7 2013 a solution has not been identified 

for fy 2013 the president requested total defense funding of 525 billion which is down from fy 2012 funding of 531 billion we anticipate that congress will consider the fy 2013 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current cr at the end of march at that time the cr will either be extended through the government’s year end thereby keeping fy 2013 spending at fy 2012 levels or the fy 2013 funding bill will be passed the president has not yet published the fy 2014 budget request although the fy 2014 topline mandated by budget reduction legislation is 527 billion because budget expenditures lag congressional funding our associated revenues and earnings in a given year do not correspond directly with the current year budgeted amounts 

in addition to the impact of us budget deficit reduction negotiations defense spending decisions over the next several years may also be shaped by the ongoing quadrennial defense review qdr an analysis of military priorities and requirements commissioned every four years we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be influenced by the following 

 

technologies in the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance unmanned systems and cyberspace arenas 

despite these budget uncertainties the longterm outlook for our us defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses while the revenue potential can be significant international defense budgets much like us budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing changing priorities and overall spending pressures as a result of the demonstrated success of our products and services we would expect our international sales and exports to grow subject to overall economic conditions 

in our aerospace group businessjet market conditions were steady in 2012 the group benefited from robust flying hours across the installed base of gulfstream aircraft improved largecabin order interest from north american corporate customers and lower customer contract defaults we expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support aerospace’s longterm growth as evidenced by the group’s newest aircraft offerings the g280 and the g650 similarly we believe that aircraftservice revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed businessjet fleet 

results of operations 

introduction 

 an understanding of our accounting practices is important to an evaluation of our operating results we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our aerospace and defense business groups 

in the aerospace group contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s other original equipment manufacturers oems completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 

the majority of the aerospace group’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor material and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating costs in the aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume mix and profitability of completions and services work performed the market for preowned aircraft and the level of general and administrative ga and net research and development rd costs incurred by the group 

in the defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or services are rendered as a result changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs yearoveryear variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 

operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts these revisions may result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract the estimated costs to complete or both therefore changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin work higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction 

consolidated overview 



review of 2011 vs 2012 



our revenues decreased in 2012  compared with 2011 revenues decreased in the information systems and technology’s mobile communication systems business and on several international wheeled vehicle contracts in the combat systems group these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in the aerospace group due to increased deliveries of g650 aircraft operating costs increased in 2012  due to several discrete charges discussed below in conjunction with our business groups’ operating results most significantly the 2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the information systems and technology group as a result operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012 

product revenues and operating costs 



product revenues were lower in 2012  compared with 2011  the decrease in product revenues consisted of the following 



in 2012  aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to green deliveries of g650 aircraft which began in the fourth  quarter of 2011  more than offsetting this increase mobile communication 

products revenues decreased due to protracted customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to followon work on several programs lower european vehicle production revenues were largely due to several contracts nearing completion and the revenue impact of the termination of the contract to provide pandur vehicles to the portuguese government ship construction revenues decreased due to the completion of the take combatlogistics ship program and timing of activity on the virginiaclass submarine program as the group transitions from the block ii to the block iii contract 

product operating costs were lower in 2012  compared with 2011 the change in product operating costs primarily due to volume consisted of the following 



discrete charges discussed in conjunction with the combat systems and information systems and technology business groups’ operating results include 89 related to the termination of the contract to provide pandur vehicles to the portuguese government 58 of ruggedized hardware inventory writedowns for products that ceased production in 2012 and 32 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the specialist vehicle sv program for the uk ministry of defence no other changes were material 

service revenues and operating costs 



service revenues increased in 2012  compared with 2011 the increase in service revenues consisted of the following 



in 2012  the increase in ship engineering and repair revenues was driven by the recent acquisition of two east coast surfaceship repair operations and higher volume on the us navy’s ohioclass replacement engineering program mobile communication support revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to higher maintenance and longterm support activity on the ukbased bowman communications systems program 

service operating costs increased in 2012  compared with 2011 the increase in service operating costs primarily due to volume consisted of the following 



the intangible asset impairment is in jet aviation’s maintenance business and discussed in conjunction with the aerospace business group’s operating results no other changes were material 

review of 2010 vs 2011 



our revenues and operating costs were up slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 revenues increased in the aerospace group primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new g650 aircraft this increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the information systems and technology group’s mobile communication systems business operating costs also increased due to the impairment of an intangible asset in our aerospace group as a result operating earnings and margins declined in 2011 

product revenues and operating costs 



product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 due to lower revenues on mobile communication products and on several ship construction programs most significantly on the ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyers and commercial productcarrier programs these decreases were partially offset by higher aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the g650 aircraft product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume however the decrease in volume was partially offset by an impairment of an intangible asset in the completions business in our aerospace group 

service revenues and operating costs 



  

service revenues increased in 2011 compared with 2010 as growth on it support and modernization programs for the dod and the intelligence community coupled with the acquisition of vangent inc resulted in higher it services revenues additionally the growing global installed base of businessjet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume 

other information 

goodwill impairment 

in 2012 we recorded a 2 billion goodwill impairment in the information systems and technology group discussed below in conjunction with the business group’s operating results and in the application of critical accounting policies 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenues ga expenses were 6 percent  in 2010  62 percent  in 2011  and 72 percent  in 2012  the increase in 2012 is due in part to restructuringrelated charges in our european military vehicles business discussed below in conjunction with the combat systems business group’s operating results we expect ga expenses in 2013 to be approximately 65 percent of revenues 

interest net 

net interest expense was 157  in 2010  141  in 2011  and 156  in 2012  the 2012 increase in interest expense is due to the 750  net increase in longterm debt beginning in july 2011  we expect fullyear 2013  net interest expense to be approximately 90  the significant expected decrease from 2012  results from our debt refinancing completed in december 2012 that lowered the weightedaverage interest rate on our outstanding debt from 39 percent to 22 percent see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations 

other net 

in 2012 other expense included a 123  loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above in 2011  other income consisted primarily of a 38 gain from the sale of a business in our combat systems group 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 307 percent  in 2010  314 percent  in 2011  and 1614 percent  in 2012  the significant increase in 2012 was primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment of 2 billion recorded in the information systems and technology group and to a lesser extent the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our international operations for further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note e to the consolidated financial statements we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent  in 2013  

discontinued operations 

in 2011  we recognized a 13  loss net of taxes in discontinued operations from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company we also increased our estimate of the continued legal costs associated with the a12 litigation as a result of the us supreme court’s decision that extended the timeline associated with the litigation resulting in a 13 loss net of taxes see note n to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the a12 litigation 

review of business groups 

following is a discussion of the operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results information regarding our business groups also can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements 

aerospace 

review of 2011 vs 2012 



the aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2012  compared to 2011  the increase consisted of the following 



aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues include the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream businessjet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other oems aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2012  primarily due to increased deliveries of the g650 aircraft 

the group’s operating earnings increased in 2012  the increase consisted of the following 



earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream aircraft increased 136 or over 10 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to green deliveries of the g650 aircraft earnings from other oem completions were up 197 in 2012 as operational performance improved operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by 78 of losses on several completions projects and a 111 impairment of the completions business contract and program intangible asset as a result of these losses and lower revenues 

 aircraft services earnings decreased in 2012 primarily due to a 191 impairment charge on intangible assets in jet aviation’s maintenance business which has been negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive marketplace particularly in europe most significantly certain oems are performing maintenance work that historically was performed by thirdparty service providers including jet aviation as a result of these market trends we reviewed the longlived assets of jet aviation’s maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and eliminated the remaining value of the contract and program and related technology intangible assets we are aligning our jet aviation maintenance business with anticipated future demand and as a result sold three europeanbased maintenance facilities in december 2012 we believe that we have rightsized jet aviation’s maintenance business to remain profitable albeit smaller in the future 

review of 2010 vs 2011 



the aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2011 primarily due to additional gulfstream largecabin green and outfitted deliveries including initial green deliveries of the new g650 aircraft higher aircraft services revenues in 2011 reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of businessjet aircraft were offset by lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays and lower volume the group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the contract losses and intangible asset impairment in our completions business discussed above and from higher rd and selling expenses 

2013 outlook 

we expect an increase of approximately 16 percent  in the group’s revenues in 2013  compared with 2012  led by gulfstream and operating margins in the mid 15 percent  range 

combat systems 

review of 2011 vs 2012 



the combat systems group’s revenues decreased in 2012  compared with 2011  the decrease consisted of the following 



in 2012 revenues were up slightly in the group’s us military vehicles business revenues increased due to the december 2011 acquisition of force protection inc higher volume on several international light armored vehicle lav programs and the start of the technology development phase of the army’s ground combat vehicle gcv program these increases were largely offset by lower volume on the domestic stryker abrams and mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle programs 

lower volume across several us armament and munitions programs including vehicle armor mk47 grenade launchers and hydra rockets due to slowed defense spending combined with the sale of the detection systems business in the second  quarter of 2011  resulted in the decrease in revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business 

in the group’s european military vehicle business revenues were down in 2012  due to lower volume on multiple wheeled vehicle contracts for various international customers that are nearing completion in 2012 final deliveries occurred under several of these contracts including piranha vehicles for the belgian army duro vehicles for the swiss government and eagle vehicles for the german government 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012  in addition to lower volume operating results in 2012 include the negative impact of three discrete charges in our european military vehicles business 

 

for further discussion of the status of the portugal program and the restructuring costs see note n to the consolidated financial statements the impact on the group’s operating margins from the charges was approximately 530 basis points 

review of 2010 vs 2011   



the combat systems group’s revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 due to reduced volume in the group’s us military vehicles business volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the abrams tank fewer survivability kits for the stryker vehicle and a decline in activity on the expeditionary fighting vehicle program as the system design and development neared completion increased volume to provide lavs for several international customers partially offset these decreases 

partially offsetting the decrease in the group’s us military vehicles business revenues were higher in the group’s european military vehicles business due to increased volume on duro and eagle wheeled vehicles for a variety of european customers the group’s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011 due to higher profitability on several major programs in our us military vehicle business 

2013 outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s revenues in 2013 to be down approximately 6 percent from 2012 with operating margins in the mid13 percent range the expected decline in revenues is due to anticipated lower services revenues in our us military vehicles business and lower overall revenues in our weapons systems business our 2013 outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget 

marine systems 

review of 2011 vs 2012   



operating results 

the marine systems group’s revenues decreased in 2012  compared with 2011  the decrease consisted of the following 



the group’s us navy shipconstruction programs include virginiaclass submarines ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyers and take combatlogistics and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships decreased revenues in 2012 of 580 on the virginiaclass and the remainder of the ships in the take programs were partially offset by an increase of 244 on the mlp and ddg destroyer programs revenues were lower on the virginiaclass program in 2012  due to timing as the group transitions from the block ii to the block iii contract in 2012 the group delivered the final ship under the take program resulting in a decrease in revenues revenues increased in 2012 on the mlp and ddg51 programs as two ships are now under construction on both programs 

revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the navy in 2012  the increase in revenues was driven by recent acquisitions of two east coast surfaceship repair operations and higher volume on the ohioclass replacement engineering program 

despite the decline in revenues the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2012  resulting in a 100  basispoint increase in operating margin compared with 2011  increases in the take profit rate contributed 53 of operating earnings approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction of the final ship 

review of 2010 vs 2011   



revenues in the marine systems group decreased slightly in 2011  due to lower volume on the ddg programs the completion of a fiveship commercial productcarrier construction program in 2010 and the wind down of the take program these decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the mlp ship construction program the ohioclass replacement program and surfaceship repair work the group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2011  due to favorable cost performance on the mature take program 

2013 outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s 2013  revenues to increase approximately 2 percent from 2012  with the completion of the take program operating margins are expected to decline to the low to mid 9 percent  range in 2013  our 2013 outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget 

information systems and technology 

review of 2011 vs 2012 



operating results 

the information systems and technology group’s revenues decreased in 2012  compared with 2011  the decrease consisted of the following 

  



the decrease in revenues in the mobile communication systems business was driven by slowed defense spending protracted us customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to followon work on several contracts this resulted in lower revenues in 2012  on key programs including the warfighter information network – tactical wint and common hardware systems chs and for encryption and ruggedized hardware products in addition over 10 percent  of the decline in the group’s revenues was due to lower volume on the ukbased bowman communications system program which has been successfully fielded and has now moved into maintenance and longterm support 

in the group’s it solutions and services business decreased volume in 2012  due to the completion of several largescale it infrastructure and support programs for the intelligence community and the dod 

including the new campus east mark center and walter reed national military medical center programs was largely offset by revenues from the 2011  acquisition of vangent inc 

revenues were down in 2012  compared with 2011  in the group’s isr business primarily due to lower optical products revenues as demand was impacted negatively by pressured defense budgets and the broader economic environment actions taken in 2012 to align the business with anticipated future demand are expected to stabilize performance in 2013 

operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012  compared with 2011  this decrease was driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges 

 

for further discussion of the impairment charges see note b to the consolidated financial statements and the application of critical accounting policies later in this section 

review of 2010 vs 2011 



the information systems and technology group’s revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010 revenues in the mobile communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by crs and protracted us customer acquisition cycles that slowed orders resulting in lower revenues on ruggedized hardware products including chs and other products with shorterterm delivery timeframes additionally revenues on the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program lower revenues in the group’s isr business resulted from the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the it solutions and services business due to the 2011 acquisition of vangent inc and higher volume on the group’s largescale it infrastructure and support programs operating earnings decreased at a lower rate than revenues resulting in a 20basispoint increase in operating margins higher margins in our mobile communication systems business were in part due to 95 of overhead reduction initiatives but were largely offset by growth in our lowermargin it solutions and services business 

2013 outlook 

we expect 2013  revenues in the information systems and technology group to be down approximately 5 percent  from 2012  with operating margins in the low8 percent range our 2013 outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget due to its shortercycle businesses the information systems and technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget reductions that may occur 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate operating costs totaled 83  in 2010  77  in 2011  and 69  in 2012  we expect 2013  fullyear corporate operating costs of approximately 90  an increase from 2012 due to less income from the advanced funding of our primary pension plan 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 513 billion  at the end of 2012  compared with 574 billion  at yearend 2011  

our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value idiq contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value on december 31 2012  estimated potential contract value associated with idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 269 billion  down 4 percent from 28 billion  at the end of 2011  we expect to realize this value over the next several years 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

the aerospace group finished 2012  with a total backlog of 157 billion  down from 179 billion  at yearend 2011  order activity included demand for products across our portfolio although orders were lower than in 2011 as we have experienced an elongated order cycle weaker order activity in the first half of 2012 improved somewhat in the second half of the year including several north american fortune 500 multiaircraft orders customer defaults were down significantly from 2011  to the lowest level in five years 

we balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize production over time this has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our g450 and g550 largecabin aircraft but we have accumulated approximately five years  of backlog for the g650 backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our g650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of that aircraft normalizes 

the group’s customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions approximately 60 percent  of the group’s yearend backlog was composed of private companies and individual buyers while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america international customers represent nearly 60 percent  of the group’s backlog over 55 percent of the group’s orders in 2012  were from north american customers as fortune 500 companies took steps in 2012 to recapitalize their fleets 

defense groups 

the total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog includes amounts that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding 

total backlog in our defense groups was 356 billion  on december 31 2012  down 10 percent  from 395 billion at the end of 2011  the decrease occurred in our combat systems and marine systems groups as work continued on large multiyear contracts awarded in prior periods 

combat systems 

combat systems’ total backlog was 87 billion at the end of 2012 down from 114 billion at yearend 2011 the group’s backlog primarily consists of longterm production contracts 

the group’s backlog on december 31 2012 included 16 billion for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the army and us allies around the world in 2012 the group received awards totaling 1 billion for all abramsrelated programs including a 395 multiyear contract to conduct development efforts for additional upgrade opportunities designed to increase the efficiency and capability of the tank the group was also awarded 170 to continue work on a multiyear contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade m1a1 tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement package sep configuration abrams backlog also included 225 for production of m1a1 tank kits for the egyptian land forces under an egyptian tank coproduction program 315 for merkava armored personnel carrier hulls and material 

kits for the israeli ministry of defense and 160 for the production of an m1a2 variant for the kingdom of saudi arabia 

the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 12 billion of the group’s backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014 the group received over 11 billion of stryker orders in 2012 including awards for production of 62 new vehicles the conversion of previously delivered vehicles to the doublevhull configuration contractor logistics support and engineering services 

the group’s backlog at year end also included 195 for the technology development phase of the army’s gcv program 140 for the buffalo mine clearance vehicle and 80 under the mrap program largely for upgrade kits for previouslydelivered vehicles 

  the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog the backlog at the end of the year included 

 the combat systems group’s backlog at year end also included 24 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs in 2012 the group received awards totaling 390 for axles in the military and commercial markets and 265 for the production of hydra70 rockets the group also received awards worth 180 from the canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition 

combat systems’ estimated potential contract value of 28 billion decreased approximately 20 percent since yearend 2011 due to the funding of idiq contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog such as for the hydra70 rocket program 

marine systems   

the marine systems group’s total backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the group periodically receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years as the group performs on the contracts backlog decreases consistent 

with this historical pattern the backlog has decreased to 171 billion at yearend 2012 compared to 185 billion at the end of 2011 

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2012 and is the largest contract in the group’s and company’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 9 billion for nine virginiaclass submarines scheduled for delivery through 2018 as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner we have submitted a proposal for the next block of submarines under the program expected to be awarded near the end of 2013 in 2012 we received 385 of awards for longlead materials for the first three boats under the next block of submarines 

navy destroyer programs represented 24 billion of the group’s backlog at yearend 2012 under the navy’s restart of the ddg51 program we have construction contracts for two destroyers scheduled for deliveries in 2016  and 2017  we have submitted a bid for a multiship construction contract that is expected to be awarded in the first half of 2013 backlog at year end also includes three ships under the ddg1000 program scheduled for deliveries in 2015 2016 and 2018  

the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included 605 for the mlp program in 2012 the group was awarded a construction contract for the third ship in the program delivery of one ship per year is scheduled beginning in 2013 and the navy’s longterm shipbuilding plan includes procurement of a fourth ship in 2014 the yearend backlog also included 335 for two liquefied natural gas lngpowered containerships construction of these ships is scheduled to begin in 2014 with deliveries in 2015 and 2016 

in addition the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 47 billion for engineering repair overhaul and other services this includes 19 billion for design and development efforts on the ohioclass replacement engineering program including 18 billion awarded in the fourth quarter of 2012 yearend backlog for maintenance and repair services totaled 14 billion 

information systems and technology 

the information systems and technology group’s total backlog was 98 billion at the end of 2012 up from 96 billion at yearend 2011 the group’s backlog does not include approximately 21 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2012 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 51 billion to the group’s backlog over half of the group’s orders resulting in a slight decrease in the estimated potential contract value from yearend 2011 when combined the group’s backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled 308 billion 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and must be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards nonetheless there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2012 included approximately 645 for the army’s wint program the backlog does not include over 300 of estimated potential contract value for the wint program awarded as an idiq contract 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog at year end also included 370 for the handheld manpack and small formfit hms program in 2012 the group received 315 in orders from the army for production of nearly 17000 rifleman and manpack radios and accessory kits 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2012 included approximately 520 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the dod and department of homeland security including the st elizabeths campus new campus east and netcents infrastructure programs 

programs for the uk ministry of defence comprised 495 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2012 work continued in 2012 on the demonstration phase of the sv program in this phase the group manages the design integration and production of seven prototype vehicles work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the combat systems group the group also has successfully fielded the bowman communications system and is now performing maintenance and longterm support and enhancement activities for the program 

in addition to these programs the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2012 including the following 

 information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2012 including the following 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities the 89 billion  of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay maturing debt our net debt was 613  at yearend 2012  down by 420  from the end of 2011  

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher on december 31 2012  1 billion  of our cash was held by international operations and therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this cash be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits 



 we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 3 billion  in 2010  32 billion  in 2011  and 27 billion  in 2012  in all three years the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings loss after removing the impact of noncash charges operating cash flow is also impacted by contributions to our pension plans which have grown from 300  in 2010  to 530  in 2012  with contributions of 600  expected in 2013  

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991  if contrary to our expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories we along with the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion  for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 16 billion  on december 31 2012  if this were the outcome we would owe half of the total or approximately 15 billion  pretax our aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 740  we believe we have sufficient resources including access to capital markets to pay such an obligation if required 

investing activities 

we used 408  in 2010  2 billion  in 2011  and 656  in 2012  for investing activities the primary uses of cash for investing activities were acquisitions and capital expenditures 

business acquisitions  we completed 16 acquisitions over the last three years totaling 23 billion we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of acquisition activity 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures were 370  in 2010  458  in 2011  and 450  in 2012  the increase in 2011  and 2012  compared with 2010  is largely due to gulfstream’s savannah georgia facilities expansion project announced in 2010 we expect capital expenditures of approximately 640  in 2013  or 2 percent  of anticipated revenues as work on gulfstream’s facilities project continues on december 31 2012 the project was approximately 35 percent complete 

marketable securities to bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment we received cash of 219 from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities in 2012 including 211 from the sale of heldtomaturity securities we held no marketable securities on december 31 2012 

other net  investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our information systems and technology group in 2010 and the detection systems business in our combat systems group in 2011 

financing activities 

we used 22 billion  in 2010  12 billion  in 2011  and 14 billion  in 2012  for financing activities including issuances and repayments of debt payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock 

debt proceeds net  in august 2010  we repaid 700  of maturing fixedrate notes in 2011  we issued 15 billion  of fixedrate notes and used the proceeds to repay 750 of maturing fixedrate notes in 2012 we issued 24 billion  of fixedrate notes and used the proceeds to redeem prior to maturity an equal amount of fixedrate notes with higher interest rates we have no material repayments of longterm debt expected until 2015 see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities 

we ended 2012  with no  commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion  in bank credit facilities that remain available these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 

dividends  on march 7 2012  our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 051  per share – the 15 th consecutive annual increase the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to 047  per share in march 2011  and 042  per share in march 2010  in advance of possible tax increases in 2013 we accelerated our first quarter 2013 dividend payment to december 2012 

share repurchases  our board of directors typically authorizes repurchases in 10 millionshare increments we repurchased 189 million  shares on the open market in 2010  20 million  shares in 2011  and 91 million  shares in 2012  as a result we reduced our shares outstanding by over 8 percent  since 2009 on december 31 2012 approximately 109 million  shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase approximately 3 percent  of our total shares outstanding 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas while we believe that these metrics provide useful information they are not operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation as a result the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for other gaap measures 

free cash flow  we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



return on invested capital  we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings loss from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic is calculated as follows 

  



additional financial information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2012  other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2012  

  



a includes scheduled interest payments see note j to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of longterm debt 

b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes 135 billion  of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 

c represents other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liabilities the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liabilities under our definedbenefit retirement plans see note p for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 



 see note n to the consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 

revenue recognition  we account for revenues and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered we determine progress using either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events that often span several years these assumptions include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events or circumstances 

we recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under this method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our longterm contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catchup method the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catchup method the net increase in our operating earnings and on a pershare basis from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled 350   

 060  in 2010 356   063  in 2011  and 180   033  in 2012  other than revisions discussed in the marine systems and information systems and technology business groups’ results of operations no revisions on any one contract were material in 2012 

goodwill and intangible assets  since 1995 we have acquired more than 65  businesses at a total cost of approximately 23 billion  including seven  in 2012  we have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business the appropriate riskadjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows due to the variables inherent in our estimate of fair value differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions we also review market multiples of earnings from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating characteristics to ensure the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows 

we conducted and completed the required goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2012 step one of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values as it relates to the test our reporting units are consistent with our business groups slowed defense spending the threat of sequestration and margin compression due to mix shift have impacted operating results and tempered the projected cash flows of the information systems and technology reporting unit negatively impacting our estimate of its fair value step one of the impairment test concluded that the book value of our information systems and technology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value for our remaining three reporting units the estimated fair values were at least double their respective book values 

for the information systems and technology reporting unit we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss based on the results of the step two analysis we recorded a 2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012 

we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable impairment losses where identified are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the longlived asset we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows prior to conducting step one of our 2012 goodwill impairment test 

we reviewed certain of our longlived assets for recoverability and recorded intangible asset impairment losses of 191 and 110 in our aerospace and information systems and technology groups respectively as discussed in the business groups’ results of operations 

commitments and contingencies  we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs  certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans  our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk  we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of 4 billion  on december 31 2011  and 25 billion  on december 31 2012  a 10 percent  unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses 



this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar eurocanadian dollar and swiss franceuro exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk  our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2012  we had 39 billion  par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent  unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years  on december 31 2012  we held 33 billion  in cash and equivalents but held no marketable securities

    revenues for the information systems and technology group were 34 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 36 percent in 2010 and 34 percent in 2011 revenues by major products and services were as follows 

 

   

general dynamics annual report 2011 9 

customers 

in 2011 69 percent of our revenues were from the us government 12 percent were from us commercial customers 9 percent were from international defense customers and the remaining 10 percent were from international commercial customers 

us government 

our primary customers are the dod and the us intelligence community we also contract with other us government customers including the department of homeland security department of health and human services centers for medicare  medicaid services and several firstresponder agencies our revenues from the us government were as follows 

 

  

 we perform our us government business under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering repair and maintenance and other services are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed fee or an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for material costs 

fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 55 percent of our us government business in 2010 and 2011 costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 39 percent in 2010 and 38 percent in 2011 and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 6 percent in 2010 and 7 percent in 2011 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels as we assume more risks such as cost overruns therefore these types of contracts offer additional profits if we can complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk accordingly the negotiated base fees are generally lower than on fixedprice contracts costreimbursement contracts also can include fee provisions that allow the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy certain performance criteria however not all costs are reimbursed under these types of contracts and the government carefully reviews the costs we charge under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates additionally because we often charge material costs with little or no fee the content mix can impact the profit margins associated with these contracts 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 33 billion in 2009 32 billion in 2010 and 38 billion in 2011 this represented approximately 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 and 2010 and 12 percent in 2011 the majority of these revenues are for businessjet aircraft where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries other commercial products include drivetrain components and aftermarket parts in our combat systems group jones act ships in our marine systems group and a variety of products and services in our information systems and technology group 

international 

our direct revenues from government and commercial customers outside the united states were 6 billion in 2009 and 2010 and 63 billion in 2011 this represented approximately 19 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 18 percent in 2010 and 19 percent in 2011 

we conduct business with government customers around the world with primary subsidiary operations in australia austria brazil canada france germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to maintaining longterm relationships with their respective governments and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our international commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years particularly in emerging markets including the asiapacific region while the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in north america orders from international customers represent a growing segment of our aircraft business with approximately 70 percent of total orders and 65 percent of total backlog in 2011

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and businessaviation markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

       defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers based in the countries where we operate our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has one primary competitor huntington ingalls industries with which it also partners on the virginiaclass submarine program our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on the team or as a provider of a specific program component or subsystem element 

another competitive factor in the defense market is the us government’s use of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts to provide customers with flexible procurement options a common type of idiq contract known as a multipleaward contract allows the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a program and establish an overall spending limit when the government awards idiq contracts to multiple bidders under the same program we must compete subsequently for individual delivery orders the idiq contracting model is most common among our information systems and technology group’s customers but also is being used in programs for which our combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

gulfstream has several competitors for each of its products with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and responsiveness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price quality and timeliness in its maintenance and repair and fbo businesses the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in its completions business the group competes with other oems as well as thirdparty providers

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our defense businesses we conduct customersponsored rd activities under us government contracts and companysponsored rd in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2011 we and our subsidiaries had 95100 employees onefifth of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 5 percent of total employees are due to expire in 2012 historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials components and subsystems these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on our costs effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks with our suppliers by entering into longterm agreements and leveraging companywide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not generally seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle internationally work for many of our government customers is weighted toward the end of the calendar year resulting in increasing revenues and earnings over the course of the year

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

     in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as us policies and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control including the international traffic in arms regulations itar 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the civil aviation administration of israel caai and the european aviation safety agency easa for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness often aircraft receive provisional type certification prior to receiving full type certification aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of some materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to cost recovery we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business 

because three of our four business groups serve the defense market our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks in our aerospace group we face risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

we depend on the us government for a significant portion of our revenues in each of the past three years more than twothirds of our revenues were from the us government us defense spending has been driven by perceived threats to national security while the country has been under an elevated threat level for the past decade competing demands for federal funds could pressure all areas of spending 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings for additional information relating to the current us defense budget see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and are subject to termination our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with the us government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted for example changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the end of the government fiscal year portions of the us government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that funds spending at prior year levels which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards additionally the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings 

we are subject to audit by the us government us government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor’s compliance with its internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating labor accounting and information systems in some cases audits may result in costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations of improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition we could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft our aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets if customers default on existing contracts and we are unable to replace those contracts the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced as a result 

  

14 general dynamics annual report 2011 

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess 

 

    if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we fail to adequately manage the risks under our contracts the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected this could affect our earnings and margins 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other companies to provide materials components and subsystems for our products subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements we often rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes government customers in newly formed freemarket economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature which may complicate the contracting process in this context our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s leadership national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenues and earnings associated with our international business 

our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at costeffective prices because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties these activities particularly in the current environment of increased government regulation and enforcement domestically and abroad may expose us to legal and regulatory risks that are different from the risks we have experienced in our existing businesses when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies and market conditions following the acquisition although we believe we have established appropriate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks and have a proven track record of successful acquisitions and investments unanticipated performance issues and acquired liabilities associated with these activities could adversely affect our financial results including future charges for impairment of longlived assets 

our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions as a defense contractor we face various cyber security threats including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information as well as threats to physical security we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own accordingly we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems if any of these threats materialize the event could cause serious harm to our business damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for future work on sensitive or classified systems for us government customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

for an overview of our business groups including a discussion of products and services provided see the business discussion contained in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

business environment 

the nation’s engagement in combating threats to us national security around the world coupled with the need to equip and modernize us military forces drives department of defense dod funding requirements as a defense contractor our financial performance is impacted by the allocation and prioritization of us defense spending procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of our us defense revenues 

for fiscal year fy 2012 the dod received funding of 531 billion including approximately 177 billion for procurement and rd this funding was approximately 22 billion less than the president’s fy 2012 request due to the budget control act bca of 2011 the bca which became law in august 2011 has two primary parts the first mandates a 487 billion reduction to previouslyplanned defense spending over the next decade the second part is a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional 500 billion of cuts on defense funding between fy 2013 and fy 2021 if the congress does not identify a means to reduce the us deficit by 12 trillion as of february 17 2012 the congress has not identified these required savings if the congress does not identify the required reduction defense spending would likely sustain further cuts 

for fy 2013 the president has requested total defense funding of 525 billion including 168 billion for investment accounts in accordance with the first part of the bca the dod’s fiveyear spending plan submitted with the fy 2013 funding request incorporates 259 billion of cuts when compared with the previous fiveyear plan however the spending plan does not include the impact of sequestration the second part of the bca despite these additional cuts investment accounts are projected to display modest growth throughout the fiveyear period with procurement funding for mature programs growing and rd funding for development programs declining over the period 

budget expenditures lag congressional funding with appropriated money generally awarded over several years a series of continuing resolutions over the past year has resulted in a protracted customer acquisition cycle that negatively impacted the flow of contract awards particularly in our shortercycle information systems and technology business group the threat of further defense spending cuts and the potential for a fourthquarter 2012 continuing resolution due to budget approval delays may further impact contract awards 

 

while the us budget deficit will continue to influence government spending decisions we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be driven by the following 

 

    with these budget uncertainties the longterm success of our us defense business is enhanced by the relevance of our programs to the military’s funding priorities the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 

in addition the continuing tenuous geopolitical landscape requires governments around the world to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to diverse defense opportunities we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses while the revenue potential can be significant international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing changing priorities and overall spending pressures as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world we expect our international sales and exports to grow 

in our aerospace group businessjet market conditions showed further improvement in 2011 particularly in the largecabin market the group benefitted from increased flying hours across the installed base improved newaircraft order interest and declining customer contract defaults continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive aerospace’s longterm growth particularly as the group remains on track to deliver its newest aircraft offerings the g280 and the g650 in mid2012 similarly we believe that

aircraftservice revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed businessjet fleet 

we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives our performance is measured in our sustained revenue growth solid earnings and margins and efficient conversion of earnings into cash our record of excellent cashflow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

results of operations 

introduction 

we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in the aerospace and defense business groups an understanding of these methods is important to the evaluation of our operating results 

in the aerospace group sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s other original equipment manufacturers oems completions and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted progress on aircraft completions and the level of service activity during the period 

the majority of the group’s operating costs relate to new aircraft production for firm orders and consist of labor material and overhead costs the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot thus the level of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered to a much lesser extent the level of operating costs is impacted by changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot operating costs in the aerospace group’s other oems completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 

for new aircraft operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of completions and services work performed the amount and type of preowned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative ga costs incurred by the group which also include selling expenses and rd costs 

in the defense groups revenue on longterm government contracts is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered as a result changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts yearoveryear variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 

operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor material subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and therefore result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 

operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to changes in profitability during the period of performance based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated contract value or the estimated costs required to complete the contract therefore changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs lowermargin work on individual contracts and when aggregated across the contract portfolio on an individual contract higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or type of work eg developmentproduction

consolidated overview 

review of 2010 vs 2011 

 

 our revenues and operating costs were up slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 revenues increased in the aerospace group primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new g650 aircraft this increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the information systems and technology group’s tactical communication systems business specifically on ruggedized computing products operating earnings declined in 2011 resulting in a 50basispoint decrease in margins while operating margins were up in each of the defense businesses operating margins decreased in the completions business for other oems in our aerospace group the decrease was caused by the impairment of an intangible asset and losses on narrow and widebody completions projects 

product revenues and operating costs 

 

 product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 the decrease in product revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in 2011 tactical communication products revenues decreased particularly on ruggedized computing products driven by order delays stemming from recent congressional continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle revenues were also down on several ship construction programs most significantly on the ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyer programs due to award delays and on the commercial productcarrier program which was completed in 2010 offsetting these decreases were higher aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the new g650 aircraft 

product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 the decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following 

 

 the primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2011 was volume in addition aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions operating costs increased in our other oems completions business due to 150 of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow and widebody completions projects and a 111 impairment of the contract and program intangible asset 

service revenues and operating costs 

 

 service revenues increased in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase in service revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in 2011 growth on it support and modernization programs for the dod and the intelligence community coupled with the acquisition of vangent inc resulted in higher it services revenues the growing global installed base of businessjet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues 

service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase in service operating costs consisted of the following 

 

 service operating costs increased in 2011 due primarily to increased activity levels in addition the acquisition of vangent inc resulted in higher it services operating costs 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 21 

review of 2009 vs 2010 

 

 in 2010 our revenues and operating costs were up due to higher volume on aircraft services in our aerospace group us navy ship programs in our marine systems group and tactical communication systems and it services in our information systems and technology group partially offset by lower us military vehicle revenues in our combat systems group growth in operating earnings significantly outpaced revenue growth in 2010 resulting in a 70basispoint increase in operating margins while each of our business groups reported earnings growth performance was particularly strong in the aerospace and combat systems groups 

product revenues and operating costs 

 

 product revenues decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 the decrease in product revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in 2010 us military vehicle product revenues decreased due to lower mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle production and reduced activity on vehicle development programs the increase in tactical communication products was driven by higher volume on the warfighter information network – tactical wint program and several ruggedized computing products 

product operating costs were lower in 2010 compared with 2009 the decrease in product operating costs consisted of the following 

 

 the primary driver of the changes in product operating costs in 2010 was volume in addition preowned aircraft operating costs decreased due to 30 of writedowns on the carrying value of inventory in 2009 

service revenues and operating costs 

 

 service revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 the increase in service revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in 2010 it services revenues increased due to higher volume on it support and modernization programs for the intelligence community ship engineering and repair revenues increased primarily on the us navy’s nextgeneration ballisticmissile submarine ssbnx program recovery in the businessjet market resulted in growth in aircraft services activity in 2010 

service operating costs increased in 2010 compared with 2009 the increase in service operating costs consisted of the following 

 

 the drivers of increased service operating costs in 2010 were primarily due to increased activity levels on it ship engineering and repair and aircraft services 

other information 

ga expenses 

as a percentage of revenues ga expenses were 61 percent in 2009 6 percent in 2010 and 62 percent in 2011 ga expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in 2011 primarily due to higher ongoing rd efforts in our aerospace group we expect ga in 2012 to be approximately 6 percent of revenues 

  

22 general dynamics annual report 2011 

interest expense 

net interest expense was 160 in 2009 157 in 2010 and 141 in 2011 the decrease in 2011 was largely due to the repayment of fixedrate notes of 700 in the third quarter of 2010 and 750 in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by interest expense associated with the 15 billion of fixedrate notes issued in july 2011 we expect fullyear 2012 net interest expense to be approximately 155 to 160 subject to capital deployment activities during the year 

other income 

in 2011 other income consisted primarily of a 38 pretax gain from the sale of the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in our combat systems group partially offset by 17 of transactionrelated costs associated with our 2011 business acquisitions for further discussion of acquisition and divestiture activity see note b to the consolidated financial statements 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 315 percent in 2009 307 percent in 2010 and 314 percent in 2011 the increase in 2011 was primarily due to lower income from international operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent in 2012 an increase from recent years largely due to the expiration of the rd tax credit that congress has not yet extended for 2012 for additional discussion of tax matters see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

in 2010 we completed the sale of our nitrocellulose operation in spain the operating results of this business are presented as discontinued operations net of income taxes in 2009 and 2010 in 2011 we recognized a 13 loss net of taxes from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company we also increased our estimate of continued legal costs associated with the a12 litigation as a result of the us supreme court’s decision that extended the expected timeline associated with the litigation resulting in a 13 loss net of taxes see note n to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the a12 litigation which has been ongoing since 1991 

review of business groups 

following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups for the aerospace group results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense groups the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to a group’s results additional information regarding our business groups can be found in note q to the consolidated financial statements 

aerospace 

review of 2010 vs 2011 

 

 the aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase consisted of the following 

 

 

aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions revenues include gulfstream businessjet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other oems gulfstream aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in 2011 due to additional largecabin green and outfitted deliveries primarily initial green deliveries of the first 12 g650 aircraft in the fourth quarter offsetting this increase were lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays on narrow and widebody commercial aircraft contracts and continued lower volume in businessjet aircraft manufactured by other oems 

aircraft services revenues which include maintenance and repair work fixedbase operations and aircraft management services increased 15 percent in 2011 reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of businessjet aircraft 

revenues from sales of preowned aircraft were down slightly from 2010 and the group ended 2011 with no preowned aircraft in inventory 

the group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011 the decrease consisted of the following

earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream aircraft increased approximately 240 or more than 20 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to initial green deliveries of the g650 aircraft earnings from other oems completions at jet aviation were down approximately 170 in 2011 primarily as a result of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow and widebody completions projects including 78 of contract losses in the fourth quarter as a result of losses and lower revenues on other oems businessjet aircraft we reviewed the related longlived assets of the completions business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and recognized a 111 impairment charge on the contract and program intangible asset we believe that major initiatives to reduce overhead and increase production efficiency undertaken by management beginning in 2011 will stabilize performance in the completions business in 2012 

despite the increase in revenues aircraft services earnings were steady in 2011 due to competitive market pricing and an unfavorable mix of service work jet aviation’s aircraft services earnings were also negatively impacted by the strength of the swiss franc as compared to the broader market 

the group’s operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by higher rd expenses and selling expenses associated with increased order activity 

as a result of the factors discussed above the group’s overall operating margins decreased 400 basis points in 2011 compared with 2010 the impact on the group’s operating margins from the impairment charge was 180 basis points 

review of 2009 vs 2010 

 

 the aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions work remained consistent with 2009 levels as an increase in manufacturing volume was offset by reduced completions revenues from sales of preowned aircraft were down slightly from 2009 

the group’s operating earnings improved in 2010 compared with 2009 across the group’s portfolio aircraft manufacturing outfitting and completions earnings increased primarily due to higher volume preowned aircraft earnings were up due to improved pricing in the preowned market and the absence of writedowns of preowned aircraft inventory that occurred in 2009 aircraft services earnings increased consistent with the higher volume operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by lower rd expenditures overall the group’s operating margins increased 250 basis points compared with 2009 

2012 outlook 

we expect an increase of approximately 15 percent in the group’s revenues in 2012 compared with 2011 the increase is due to additional green deliveries and initial outfitted deliveries of the g650 we expect the aerospace group’s margins to be approximately 15 percent up from 2011 due to improved performance in our other oems completions business 

combat systems 

review of 2010 vs 2011 

 

 the combat systems group’s revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 the decrease in the group’s revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in the group’s us military vehicle business volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the abrams main battle tank fewer survivability enhancement kits for the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and a decline in activity on the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv program as the system design and development neared completion increased volume on the group’s contracts to provide light armored vehicles lavs for several international customers partially offset these decreases 

revenues were up slightly in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses increased sales of axles in the commercial and military markets were partially offset by the timing of munitions deliveries to the canadian government and the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011 

revenues in the group’s european military vehicles business increased in 2011 largely due to higher volume of duro and eagle wheeled vehicles to a variety of european customers including the swiss and german governments offsetting this increase was lower activity on the group’s pandur and piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers 

the group’s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011 following a 130basispoint margin improvement in 2010 the 10basispoint increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher profitability on several major programs in our us military vehicles business 

  

24 general dynamics annual report 2011 

review of 2009 vs 2010 

 

 in 2010 the combat systems group’s revenues decreased compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group’s us and european military vehicles businesses in the group’s us military vehicles business lower mrap vehicle production and reduced engineering work primarily related to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs program represented the majority of the decline in revenues revenues in the group’s european military vehicles business decreased due to the rampdown of the leopard tank program for the spanish government and lower activity on the group’s pandur and piranha contracts 

despite the decline in revenues the combat systems group’s operating earnings increased slightly in 2010 resulting in a 130basispoint increase in operating margins compared with 2009 productivity improvements across the group particularly in the us military vehicles business and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin expansion 

2012 outlook 

we expect the combat systems group’s revenues to decrease to approximately 85 billion in 2012 a reduction in our us military vehicles business primarily due to lower volume on the stryker and mrap programs will be partially offset by growth in international vehicle contracts and revenues from the december 2011 acquisition of force protection inc we expect the group’s operating margins to approximate 2011 in the low to mid14 percent range 

marine systems 

review of 2010 vs 2011 

 

 the marine systems group’s revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 the decrease in revenues consisted of the following 

 

 the group’s us navy shipconstruction programs include virginiaclass submarines ddg1000 and ddg51 destroyers and take combatlogistics and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships 

revenues were down slightly in 2011 on the virginiaclass submarine program from timing of construction activity as we transitioned from the block ii to the block iii contract in 2011 the group delivered the eighth boat while construction continued on the next six boats deliveries of the remaining 10 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018 

in our surface combatant business the group received an award for construction of the second and third ships in the ddg1000 destroyer program in the third quarter of 2011 due to a delay in the award revenues were down on the program in 2011 deliveries of the three ddg1000 ships under contract are scheduled for 2014 2015 and 2018 on the ddg51 program volume was also lower as the legacy multiship contract neared completion with the remaining destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2012 in the third quarter of 2011 in connection with the navy’s restart of the ddg51 program the group was awarded a construction contract for a ddg51 destroyer scheduled for delivery in 2016 and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer 

volume increased on the mlp program in 2011 as the group commenced construction on the first ship of the threeship program the first ship is scheduled for delivery in 2013 in 2011 the group also received a construction contract for the second ship and longlead funding for the third ship activity on the group’s take program was down in 2011 as the group delivered the 11 th and 12 th ships in the program the final two ships are scheduled for completion in 2012 

while navy shipconstruction revenues were down from 2010 revenues were up in 2011 on engineering and repair programs for the navy volume increased in 2011 on the group’s engineering work associated with the ssbnx the group currently is performing initial concept studies including design of a common missile compartment for the us navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom and reactorplant planning yard services the group’s repair work increased in 2011 following significant growth in 2010 particularly on surfaceship repair programs this growth was aided by the 2011 acquisition of metro machine corp a surfaceship repair operation located in norfolk virginia this addition coupled with our existing capabilities enables us to deliver maintenance and repair services to the atlantic and pacific fleets 

in 2010 the group completed construction of a fiveship commercial productcarrier program resulting in a decrease in commercial shipbuilding revenues in 2011 given the success of this program the age of jones act ships and other factors we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities 

despite the decrease in revenues the marine systems group’s operating earnings were up in 2011 compared with 2010 resulting in a 30basispoint increase in operating margins on the take contract a modification negotiated during the year and favorable cost performance resulted in revisions in contract estimates that contributed 70 basis points to the 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 25 

group’s 2011 operating margin expansion this operating margin growth was offset by the absence of commercial ship construction revenues and operating margin compression as we transition to several new shipbuilding contracts and lowermargin service and design work increases 

review of 2009 vs 2010 

 

 revenues in the marine systems group were up in 2010 primarily due to increased activity on the virginiaclass program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year and higher volume on the group’s ssbnx engineering program lower activity on the ddg51 and take programs and the completion of the fiveship commercial productcarrier program slightly offset other volume increases in the group in 2010 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues as favorable performance on the take and commercial productcarrier programs offset a shift in program mix to new shipbuilding contracts and design work 

2012 outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s revenues in 2012 to decrease slightly from 2011 due to the timing of several shipconstruction programs with operating margins approximating 2011 in the low to mid10 percent range 

information systems and technology 

review of 2010 vs 2011 

 

 the information systems and technology group’s revenues decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 the decrease in revenues consisted of the following 

 

 revenues in the tactical communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by recent continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle that slowed orders this resulted in lower revenues in 2011 on ruggedized computing products including the common hardwaresoftware iii chs3 program and other products with shorterterm delivery timeframes additionally revenues on the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program revenues were up in the group’s united kingdombased operation due to higher volume on the initial phase of the uk ministry of defence specialist vehicle sv program 

in the it services business volume increased on the group’s support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the departments of defense dod and homeland security including the st elizabeths campus new campus east walter reed national military medical center and mark center infrastructure programs revenues also increased in this business as a result of the acquisition of vangent inc in the fourth quarter of 2011 

revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010 in the group’s isr business as a result of the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings decreased in 2011 although at a lower rate than revenues resulting in a 20basispoint increase in margins compared with 2010 higher margins in our tactical communication systems business were in part due to 95 of overhead reduction initiatives but were largely offset by growth in our lowermargin it services business 

review of 2009 vs 2010 

 

 the information systems and technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group’s markets in 2010 with over 5 percent organic growth revenues increased on the wint program and ruggedized computing products in the group’s tactical communication systems business in the it services business higher volume on several it support and modernization programs for the intelligence community accounted for the increase in revenues the 2009 acquisition of axsys technologies inc and growing levels of cyber securityrelated work contributed to the growth in the group’s isr business 

operating earnings increased in 2010 although at a slightly lower rate than revenues resulting in a modest decrease in operating margins compared with 2009 the reduction in operating margins resulted from a shift in the group’s contract mix to include a growing proportion of it services work 

  

26 general dynamics annual report 2011 

2012 outlook 

we expect 2012 revenues in the information systems and technology group to be consistent with 2011 as growth in the it services business driven by the acquisition of vangent inc is offset by continued revenue pressure in our tactical communication systems business the group’s operating margins are expected to decline to the high9 percent range due to the impact of continued revenue growth in our lowermargin it services business 

corporate 

corporate operating expenses totaled 87 in 2009 83 in 2010 and 77 in 2011 corporate results primarily consist of compensation expense for stock options see note o to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock options we expect 2012 corporate operating expenses of approximately 80 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 574 billion at the end of 2011 compared with 596 billion at yearend 2010 strong orders on major programs across our defense groups resulted in a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenues slightly higher than 2010 while our aerospace group generated a booktobill ratio greater than onetoone our backlog also increased nearly 18 billion due to our 2011 acquisitions 

our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value customers use idiq contracts for several reasons including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed the estimated contract value includes multipleaward idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders as well as contracts where we have been designated as the solesource supplier we include our estimate of the remaining value we will receive under these arrangements 

contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work at the election of the customer these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

on december 31 2011 the estimated potential contract value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 28 billion up significantly from 218 billion at the end of 2010 this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower the estimated potential contract value increased in 2011 in our marine systems and information systems and technology groups largely due to the ddg51 option and common hardware systems4 chs4 idiq contract awards the acquisition of vangent inc in 2011 also added approximately 12 billion to the information systems and technology group’s estimated potential contract value we expect to realize this value primarily over the next several years reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future 

aerospace 

aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer funded backlog includes the group’s newest aircraft models the g650 and the g280 which are expected to receive full type certification and enter service in mid2012 aerospace unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

the aerospace group finished 2011 with a total backlog of 179 billion up slightly from 178 billion at yearend 2010 in 2011 the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft since the introduction of the g650 in 2008 customer defaults were down more than 15 percent from 2010 

we balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and levelload production over time this has enabled us to maintain an 18 to 24month period between customer order and delivery of legacy largecabin aircraft while the g650 has accumulated approximately five years of backlog prior to initial deliveries although we expect order activity to remain strong and customer defaults to remain at low levels backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our g650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of the aircraft normalizes 

over the past few years the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse in customer type and geographic region approximately twothirds of the group’s yearend backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america international customers represent nearly 65 percent of the group’s backlog approximately 70 percent of the group’s orders in 2011 were from international customers with significant growth in orders from the asiapacific region in 2011 gulfstream received an 810 order from minsheng 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 27 

financial leasing the chinese financial leasing company of minsheng bank for the purchase of 20 gulfstream aircraft across the product portfolio over several years 

in 2011 a fleet customer informed us of its intent not to purchase 40 largecabin aircraft we removed these aircraft from the group’s estimated potential contract value with no impact to annual scheduled deliveries at year end there were no options to purchase new aircraft or longterm agreements with fleet customers included in estimated potential contract value 

defense groups 

the total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of the defense backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 

total backlog in our defense groups decreased 5 percent in 2011 to 395 billion at the end of the year compared with 417 billion at the end of 2010 over 70 percent of the decline during 2011 was in our marine systems group which continued work on large multiyear construction contracts awarded in prior periods 

combat systems 

 

combat systems’ total backlog was 114 billion at the end of 2011 down slightly from 118 billion at yearend 2010 the group’s backlog primarily consists of longterm production contracts 

the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented 15 billion of the group’s backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014 the group received over 14 billion of stryker orders in 2011 including awards for production of 292 doublevhulled vehicles and 100 nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicles and contractor logistics support and engineering services 

the group’s backlog at year end included 11 billion for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs in 2011 the group received awards totaling 380 for all abramsrelated programs the group continued work on a multiyear contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade m1a1 abrams tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement package sep configuration the group’s abrams backlog at year end included 330 for the sep program abrams backlog also includes 200 for tank urban survivability kits tusk which increase the tank’s utility and crew survivability in urban warfare environments and 310 for production of m1a1 abrams tank kits for the egyptian land forces under the egyptian tank coproduction program 

the group’s backlog at year end also included 400 for the technology development phase of the army’s ground combat vehicle gcv program and 280 under the mrap program largely for upgrade kits for previouslydelivered vehicles the acquisition of force protection inc in 2011 added 660 to the group’s backlog including 200 for the buffalo mine clearance vehicle and 185 for the smaller ocelot light patrol vehicle 

the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog the backlog at the end of the year included 

 

        the combat systems group’s backlog at year end also included 27 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs in 2011 the group received awards totaling 630 for axles in the military and commercial markets and 305 for the production of hydra70 rockets the group also received awards worth 335 from the canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition and 190 from the marine corps for ammunition for the expeditionary fire support system 

combat systems backlog does not include 35 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group’s anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options the group’s estimated potential contract value decreased approximately 25 percent since yearend 2010 

  

28 general dynamics annual report 2011 

largely due to funding under idiq contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog including the hydra70 rocket program 

marine systems 

 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years for example in 2008 the group received a 14 billion contract for the construction of eight virginiaclass submarines to be delivered through 2018 increasing backlog to an alltime high of 264 billion at the end of 2008 consistent with this historical pattern as the group has performed on these multiyear contracts the backlog has decreased to 185 billion at yearend 2011 compared to 201 billion at the end of 2010 while backlog decreased in our submarine business backlog increased in both of our surface shipyards from major contract awards in 2011 

the virginiaclass submarine program was the company’s largest program in 2011 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 11 billion for ten virginiaclass submarines as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner plans published by the navy include a request for proposals in 2012 for nine submarines under a fourth block of the program 

navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog these include the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and zumwaltclass ddg1000 destroyer programs in 2011 the group received approximately 16 billion in orders under the ddg1000 program bringing the value in backlog to 18 billion for the construction of three ships including two awarded in 2011 and continued engineering and support services at year end the backlog also included 620 for ddg51 destroyers the final destroyer under the navy’s legacy multiship contract is scheduled for delivery in 2012 additionally in connection with the navy’s restart of the ddg51 program the group was awarded in 2011 a construction contract for a ddg51 destroyer and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer 

the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included 660 for the mlp program in 2011 the group was awarded construction contracts for the first two ships in the program and longlead funding for the third ship the yearend backlog also included approximately 315 for the last two ships under the navy’s take combatlogistics ship program and 160 for the group’s second ship under the navy’s littoral combat ship lcs program scheduled for delivery in 2012 

in addition the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 39 billion for engineering repair overhaul and other services this includes 23 billion in design and engineering efforts for the ssbnx the group received several significant contract awards in 2011 totaling 645 to continue development work additionally the acquisition of metro machine corp in 2011 added 485 to the group’s backlog for maintenance and repair services to be performed in norfolk virginia the group also received a 35 award in 2011 for the outfitting of the san antonioclass amphibious assault dock ship lpd uss san diego with an option for work on two additional ships 

information systems and technology 

 

the information systems and technology group’s total backlog was 96 billion at the end of 2011 down slightly from 98 billion at yearend 2010 backlog was impacted in part by award delays stemming from recent continuing resolutions the group’s backlog does not include approximately 224 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2011 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 39 billion to the group’s backlog or over 35 percent of the group’s orders the estimated potential contract value in the information systems and technology group increased nearly 50 percent from yearend 2010 most notably due to the 37 billion chs4 contract award and the acquisition of vangent inc that added 12 billion when combined the group’s backlog and estimated potential contract value increased by 28 percent over 2010 to 32 billion 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 29 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and has to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards nonetheless there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business 

programs for the uk ministry of defence comprised 670 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2011 work continued in 2011 on the demonstration phase of the ministry of defence specialist vehicle program in this phase the group will manage the design integration and production of seven prototype vehicles work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the combat systems group including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort the group has successfully fielded the bowman communications system the secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces and is now performing maintenance and longterm support and enhancement activities for the program 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2011 included approximately 330 for the army’s wint program information systems and technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network in 2011 the group received approximately 370 of awards for wint the backlog does not include 795 of estimated potential contract value for the wint program awarded under an idiq contract 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog at year end also included 150 for the chs3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers network equipment and software to the us armed forces and other us federal agencies in 2011 the group received 250 in orders under this program bringing the total contract value to more than 26 billion the group also received an idiq contract award for the next phase of the program chs4 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2011 included approximately 755 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the departments of defense and homeland security including the st elizabeths campus new campus east netcents and walter reed national military medical center infrastructure programs 

in addition to these programs the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2011 including the following 

 

     information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2011 including the following 

 

    financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation this focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities in 2011 cash flows from operations exceeded net earnings for the 13 th consecutive year the 91 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay maturing debt our net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was 1 billion at yearend 2011 up by 655 from 378 at the end of 2010 largely due to the issuance of fixedrate notes in 2011 and continued capital deployment activities 

our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher and shortterm repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the spanish government as collateral our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and highquality corporate municipal and us governmentsponsored debt securities the marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of aa we have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments on december 31 2011 635 of our cash was held by international operations and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits

   we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 29 billion in 2009 3 billion in 2010 and 32 billion in 2011 in all three years the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings in 2011 operating cash flow also benefitted from customer deposits due upon receipt of provisional type certification of the g650 cash from operating activities reflects contributions to our pension plans which have grown in recent years from 300 in 2009 to 350 in 2011 with contributions of 500 expected in 2012 

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to our expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories we along with the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 16 billion on december 31 2011 if this were the outcome we would owe half of the total or approximately 15 billion pretax our aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 735 we believe we have sufficient resources including access to capital markets to pay such an obligation if required 

investing activities 

we used 14 billion in 2009 408 in 2010 and 2 billion in 2011 for investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities 

business acquisitions in 2009 we completed two acquisitions for 811 in 2010 we completed three acquisitions for 233 in 2011 we completed six acquisitions for 16 billion we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of acquisition activity 

capital expenditures capital expenditures were 385 in 2009 370 in 2010 and 458 in 2011 the increase in 2011 compared with 2009 and 2010 is due largely to gulfstream’s 500 sevenyear savannah georgia facilities expansion project announced in 2010 we expect capital expenditures of approximately 600 in 2012 or 2 percent of anticipated revenues as work on gulfstream’s facilities project increases 

marketable securities as a result of lower market interest rates we expanded our investment strategy several years ago to take advantage of the additional return generated by availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities net purchases of these securities were 235 in 2009 compared with net proceeds of 115 in 2010 and net purchases of 49 in 2011 

other net investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our information systems and technology group in 2010 and the detection systems portion of the weapons systems business in the combat systems group in 2011 

financing activities 

we used 806 in 2009 22 billion in 2010 and 12 billion in 2011 for financing activities our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 

debt proceeds net in 2009 we issued 750 of twoyear fixedrate notes in 2011 we issued 15 billion of fixedrate notes in 500 increments due in january 2015 july 2016 and july 2021 we used the proceeds from these fixedrate notes in part to repay the 750 of fixedrate notes issued in 2009 in august 2010 we repaid 700 of fixedrate notes we have no material repayments of longterm debt expected until 2013 see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities 

we ended 2011 with no commercial paper outstanding we have 2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 31 

dividends our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 047 per share on march 2 2011 the 14 th consecutive annual increase the board had previously approved a quarterly dividend of 042 per share in march 2010 and 038 per share in march 2009 

share repurchases our board of directors has historically supported management’s tactical repurchase of our shares typically in repurchase authorizations of 10millionshare increments we repurchased 36 million shares on the open market in 2009 189 million shares in 2010 and 20 million shares in 2011 as a result we reduced our shares outstanding by 42 percent in 2011 and nearly 8 percent since 2009 on october 5 2011 with no shares remaining under a prior authorization the board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding 

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns as described below we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and earn a return on the deployment of that capital 

free cash flow we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management over the past five years we have generated free cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period at an average 107 percent conversion rate the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

 return on invested capital we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense over the past five years our roic has averaged 174 percent roic is calculated as follows

 application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our longterm contracts and programs other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and commitments and contingencies we make our best estimates on historical and current experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition we account for revenues and earnings using the percentageofcompletion method under this method contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses either as products are produced or as services are rendered we determine progress using either input measures 

  

general dynamics annual report 2011 33 

eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances an input measure is used unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure for our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 

accounting for longterm contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events these events often span several years including labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the performance of subcontractors and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimates claims against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events or circumstances 

we recognize changes in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our longterm contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned alternatively most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catchup method as a result the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catchup method the net increase in our operating earnings from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled 350 in 2010 and 410 in 2011 reflecting favorable operational performance across our contract portfolio other than revisions discussed in the aerospace and marine systems business groups’ results of operations no revisions on any one contract were material 

goodwill and intangible assets since 1995 we have acquired over 60 businesses at a total cost of approximately 22 billion including six in 2011 in connection with these acquisitions we have recognized 136 billion and 18 billion of goodwill and intangible assets respectively 

goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units these estimates require the use of judgment we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “topdown” analyses including a market assessment of our enterprise value we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date nor do we anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to impairment in the foreseeable future the fair value of each of our reporting units on december 31 2011 exceeded its carrying value under the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable impairment losses where identified are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the longlived asset we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows we recorded an impairment loss in 2011 related to our completions business as discussed in the aerospace group’s results of operations 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is 

  

34 general dynamics annual report 2011 

probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts our business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forwardlooking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and postretirement benefit plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of 42 billion on december 31 2010 and 4 billion on december 31 2011 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses 

 

 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar eurocanadian dollar and us dollareuro exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2011 we had 39 billion par value of fixedrate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years on december 31 2011 we held 29 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities which had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than two months on december 31 2011 our marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of aa a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the value of the holdings historically we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values

formed in 1952 through the combination of electric boat company consolidated vultee convair and other companies general dynamics grew organically and through acquisitions until the early 1990s when we sold nearly all of our divisions except electric boat and land systems beginning in 1995 we expanded those two core defense businesses by acquiring additional shipyards and combat vehiclerelated businesses in 1997 to reach a new expanding market we began acquiring companies with expertise in information technology products and services in 1999 we purchased gulfstream aerospace corporation a businessjet aircraft and aviation supportservices company since 1995 we have acquired and integrated 57 businesses including three in 2010 

general dynamics operates through four business groups aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology for selected financial information regarding each of our business groups see note q to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

aerospace 

our aerospace group designs manufactures and outfits a comprehensive family of mid and largecabin businessjet aircraft and provides maintenance refurbishment outfitting and aircraft services for a variety of businessjet narrowbody and widebody aircraft customers globally with more than 50 years of experience at the forefront of the businessjet aviation market the aerospace group is noted for 

 

   the group’s gulfstream products include eight aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options the varying ranges speeds and cabin dimensions are wellsuited to the transportation needs of an increasingly diverse global customer base the largecabin models are 

  

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 3 

 

  

manufactured at gulfstream’s headquarters in savannah georgia and outfitted at one of the group’s us completion facilities the midcabin models are constructed by a key supplier and outfitted by gulfstream in one of the group’s us completion centers 

while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america international customers represent nearly 60 percent of the group’s backlog with growing order interest from emerging markets including the asiapacific region private companies and individual customers collectively represent approximately twothirds of the group’s total orders gulfstream remains a leading provider of aircraft for government and military service around the world with aircraft operated by nearly 40 nations these government aircraft are used for headofstateexecutive transportation and a variety of specialmission applications including aerial reconnaissance maritime surveillance weather research and astronaut training 

to maximize profitability management has adjusted aircraft production rates invested in innovative product development and facilities and enhanced the group’s global service network for example prior to the recent economic downturn gulfstream amassed a multiyear largecabin backlog by making measured increases in aircraft production that consciously lagged growing international customer demand this backlog provided gulfstream increased flexibility when global economic turmoil began to negatively impact the businessjet market in late 2008 in response to this sudden market deterioration we quickly and aggressively cut 2009 production levels to stabilize the backlog we also reduced employment cut overhead costs and introduced a multiweek summer furlough to adjust the group’s manufacturing operations improved new order activity and lower customer default levels enabled us to maintain largecabin production in 2010 while modestly increasing midcabin production 

the aerospace group continuously invests in research and development rd over the course of each aircraft model’s lifecycle to introduce new products and firsttomarket enhancements that broaden customer choice improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety comfort and inflight productivity the two newest aircraft to join the gulfstream family the supermidsize g250 and the ultralargecabin ultrahighspeed g650 demonstrate this innovation the g250 which will replace the g200 offers the largest cabin and the longest range at the fastest speed in its class the g650 has the longest range fastest speed largest cabin and most advanced cockpit in the gulfstream fleet and defines a completely new segment at the top of the businessjet market scheduled to enter service in late 2011 and mid2012 respectively both aircraft continue to perform well in flight testing and they each remain on track for aircraft certification in 2011 gulfstream’s new and upgraded aircraft models are designed to minimize lifecycle costs while maximizing the commonality of parts among the various models 

current productenhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics composites flightcontrol systems acoustics cabin technologies and enhanced vision systems recent innovations include the secondgeneration enhanced vision system evs ii and the synthetic visionprimary flight display svpfd both of which assist the pilot during lowvisibility conditions evs ii is a specially designed forwardlooking infrared flir camera that projects a realworld infrared image on the pilots headup display hud while synthetic vision provides threedimensional images of the terrain runway environment and obstacles on the pilot’s primary headdown display these products work in tandem to provide pilots with unparalleled situational awareness regardless of weather terrain or landingfield conditions 

in november 2010 we announced a 500 sevenyear facilities expansion project at gulfstream’s savannah campus designed to ensure the group is wellpositioned to meet future demand for businessjet aircraft and support services this investment plan includes constructing new facilities renovating existing infrastructure and expanding the group’s rd center the new effort follows a recently completed 400 multiyear project in savannah that established a purposebuilt g650 manufacturing facility increased aircraftservice capacity improved the group’s customer sales and design center and created a stateoftheart paint facility this expansion initiative has paid immediate dividends for example the new manufacturing facility designed for lean manufacturing and precision assembly has successfully produced the five g650 test aircraft that are being used to meet the program’s certification testing schedule further the newly expanded service center helped accommodate the significant recovery in customer demand in 2010 

in addition to the increased service capacity in savannah gulfstream’s service network continues to evolve to address the demands of the growing international installed base in 2010 we focused on increasing the group’s international parts and materials inventory adding key personnel in fastgrowing markets including asia and south america and realigning our existing north american service organization in the western hemisphere gulfstream’s product support team continues to deploy a team of technicians in support of urgent customerservice requirements we have also leveraged our 2008 acquisition of jet aviation a maintenance and repair services provider with aircraft service centers in more than 20 locations worldwide to provide customers around the world firstinclass service and support 24 hours a day 

jet aviation also expanded the aerospace group’s portfolio to include premium aircraftoutfitting operations for airframes produced by other original equipment manufacturers oems jet aviation performs aircraft completions and refurbishments for business jets and narrow and widebody commercial aircraft at locations in europe and the united states as a trusted provider of turnkey aircraft management and fixedbase operations fbo services to a broad global customer base jet aviation supports the continued growth and diversification of the aerospace portfolio

openocean and littoral missions these stealthy ships are wellsuited for a variety of global assignments including intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch the virginiaclass program includes 30 submarines which the customer is procuring in multiship blocks the group has delivered the first seven of 18 boats under contract in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction of these vessels in 2010 marine systems delivered the seventh boat in a record 65 months five months faster than any of the previous boats in the program the remaining 11 boats under contract extend deliveries through 2018 as a result of us combatantcommander requirements for the versatile capabilities of the virginiaclass submarine strong customer and congressional support innovative costsaving design and production efforts and successful program performance the group is scheduled to start construction of two submarines per year beginning in 2011 the group has been working toward this increased submarine production workload for several years 

marine systems also is the lead designer and producer of arleigh burke destroyers the only active destroyer in the navy’s global surface fleet in 2010 we delivered uss jason dunham  the 32 nd of 34 ddg51 ships the navy has contracted with us to build the two remaining ships are scheduled for delivery in 2011 and 2012 respectively ddg51s are multimission combatants that offer excellent defense against a wide range of threats including ballistic missile defense the navy plans to continue the ddg51 program given the proven capabilities of this destroyer the group expects to receive an award in 2011 for an additional ddg51 ship associated with the continuation of this program marine systems remains the lead ddg51 design and planning shipyard managing the design modernization and lifecycle support of these ships 

the group’s take combatlogistics ship supports multiple missions for the navy including replenishment at sea for us and nato operating forces around the world take is the first navy ship to incorporate proven commercial marine technologies such as integrated electricdrive propulsion these technologies are designed to minimize take operations and maintenance costs over an expected 40year life in 2010 we received construction contracts for the final two ships under the 14ship program the group has delivered the first 10 of these ships including two in 2010 work is underway on the remaining four ships with two deliveries scheduled in 2011 and two in 2012 

the group is also developing technologies and naval platforms for the future these design and engineering efforts include initial concept studies for the development of the nextgeneration ballisticmissile submarine ssbn which is expected to replace the current ohio class of ballistic missile submarines the group is also participating in the design of the ssbn common missile compartment under development for the us navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom 

marine systems participates in a number of programs in support of the navy’s efforts to renew its surface fleet the group has completed the detailed design of the nextgeneration guidedmissile destroyer the ddg1000 zumwalt class and is currently building the first ship at its bath maine shipyard in 2010 the group was awarded a contract for continued engineering and support services for the program and longlead construction and material for the second and third ships we expect to be awarded construction contracts for the second and third ships in 2011 

in 2010 the group was awarded a contract for longlead material and advanced design efforts for the first ship of the mobile landing platform mlp program the mlp is an auxiliary support ship intended to serve as a floating transfer station improving the navy’s ability to deliver equipment and cargo to areas without adequate port access in support of a variety of missions the navy plans to build three mlp ships and the contract for construction of the first ship is scheduled to be awarded in 2011 

in addition to these design and construction programs marine systems provides comprehensive ship and submarine overhaul repair and lifecycle support services to extend the service life of these vessels and maximize the value of these ships to the customer the group operates the only fullservice maintenance and repair shipyard on the west coast positioning us to support the navy’s rebalancing of its surface force toward the pacific fleet the group also provides international allies with program management planning engineering and design support for submarine and surfaceship construction programs 

beyond its navy programs marine systems designs and produces ships for commercial customers to meet the jones act requirement that ships carrying cargo between us ports be built in us shipyards in 2010 the group completed a contract to build five productcarrier ships given the group’s proven success on this program the age of the fleet of jones act ships and environmental regulations that require doublehull tankers and impose emission control limits we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities to materialize as the economy recovers 

to further the group’s goals of efficiency affordability for the customer and continuous improvement we make strategic investments in our business often in cooperation with the navy and local governments in addition marine systems leverages its design and engineering expertise across its business to improve program execution and generate cost savings this knowledge sharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements the group is wellpositioned to effectively fulfill the shipconstruction and support requirements of its navy and commercial customers 

revenues for the marine systems group were 19 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 20 percent in 2009 and 21 percent in 2010 revenues by major products and services were as follows

information systems and technology 

our information systems and technology group provides critical technologies products and services that support a wide range of government and commercial communication and informationsharing needs the group consists of a threepart portfolio centered on tactical communication systems information technology services and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems 

tactical communication systems – the group designs manufactures and delivers trusted and secure communications systems commandandcontrol systems and operational hardware to customers within the us department of defense the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies and to international customers our leadership in this market results from decades of experience with previous systems incumbency on today’s programs and an ongoing record of innovation that encompasses key technologies at the center of our customers’ missions these include 

 

     this market is characterized by programs that enhance warfighters’ ability to communicate collaborate and access vital information through internetlike networks on the battlefield key programs include the us army’s warfighter information networktactical wint and the joint tactical radio system jtrs 

wint is the army’s primary battlefield communications network as the prime contractor we are responsible for the design engineering integration production program management and support of the network using ground and satellite communications links wint provides commanders with the digital communications services they need to access intelligence information initiate battle plans collaborate with other military elements issue orders and monitor the status of their forces the group has deployed the first increment of wint around the world to more than half of the us army the group is transitioning into the second increment of the program which adds onthemove command and control and expands the capability to additional soldiers the third increment of the program is designed to provide enhanced network reliability and capacity and smaller moretightly integrated communications and networking gear 

the jtrs program will provide communications among all branches of the us military on multichannel softwaredefined radios we are developing the jtrs handheld manpack small form fit hms network radios to connect soldiers sensors and robotic platforms these small radios will enhance dismounted soldiers’ situational awareness and combat effectiveness by giving them greater communications capabilities and access to intelligence data in the field this critical networking capability was successfully demonstrated by the army during extensive testing exercises in 2010 that connected command posts onthemove forces and dismounted soldiers these exercises also demonstrated how wint and jtrs enable key battle command applications to increase force effectiveness across a variety of missions and terrain 

information systems and technology delivers the same type of modern communications and informationsharing benefits to many civilian customers including the us department of homeland security and other federal civilian agencies for example we are the prime contractor for the us coast guard’s rescue 21 system which provides enhanced searchandrescue capabilities as well as stateoftheart commandandcontrol capabilities to assist the coast guard in effectively deploying available assets on all maritime missions 

we also provide many of these capabilities to nonus customers including the uk ministry of defence and the canadian department of national defence most recently the uk ministry of defence awarded the group a contract for the demonstration phase of its specialist vehicle program in this phase the group will manage the design integration and production of seven prototypes the specialist vehicle’s open electronic architecture will make the fleet easier to maintain and reduce product lifecycle costs work under the contract will be shared with the combat systems group including a significant portion of the future production effort 

information technology services – the group provides missioncritical information technology it and highly specialized missionsupport services to the us defense and intelligence communities the department of homeland security and other federal civilian agencies and commercial and international customers the group specializes in 

 

    in this market information systems and technology has a longstanding reputation for excellence in providing technicalsupport personnel and domain specialists who enable customers to execute their missions effectively for many customers the group’s employees are the oncall staff that provide technical support for both commercial desktop technology and missionspecific hardware our employees also develop install and operate mission systems on a daytoday basis in fort huachuca arizona for example information systems and technology employees

provide training and it support services for critical army intelligence operations including unmanned aircraft systems training units we integrate and operate systems that create lifelike training scenarios helping operators improve their proficiency at a fraction of the cost of liveaction exercises 

information systems and technology also supplies networkmodernization and it infrastructure services to us government customers as one of the us air force’s leading partners for network modernization the group has provided it support services to more than 75 air force bases and it currently supports the air force’s main operating bases the group also has provided continuous enterprisewide it services and support to the us senate for more than five years 

in addition we are a leading provider of healthcare technology solutions that meet the fastgrowing needs for technology modernization of government and commercial healthcare organizations our offerings include data management analytics fraud prevention and detection software decision support and process automation solutions in afghanistan and iraq the group supports the army’s military healthcare it mission helping ensure continuity of care for injured soldiers by providing accurate and timely information to medical staff both in the field and at treatment facilities for the centers for medicare  medicaid services we are supporting the government’s implementation of healthcare reform and medical benefits programs including facilitating a program to provide retirees with prescription health coverage 

intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems – we also provide missionrelated systems development integration and operations support to customers in the us defense intelligence and homeland security communities and to us allies these offerings include 

 

      we have a 50year legacy of providing advanced fire control systems for navy submarine programs and currently are developing and integrating commercialofftheshelf cots software and hardware upgrades to improve the tactical control capabilities for multiple submarine classes this initiative leads the implementation of the navys open architecture and open business model approach on submarines with a design that emphasizes shared standards providing greater interoperability scalability and supplier independence capitalizing on this expertise and open architecture approach the group developed the core mission system for the navy’s independence class of littoral combat ships lcs and it is the ship mission systems integrator on the joint high speed vessel jhsv program for the army and the navy 

information systems and technology continues to expand its imagery offerings for example the group recently integrated cameras and optics with algorithms and sensors to enhance customers’ ability to gather and interpret visual data this group also produces the defense department’s mostwidely used imageryanalysis software suite this software is currently providing actionable information derived from raw intelligence and archived imagery to more than 10000 intelligence and tactical users 

information systems and technology’s contracts in securing and protecting organizations from network attacks have resulted in a marketleading position in cyber security the group performs data recovery forensic examinations and diagnostics as a prime contractor for the dod cyber crime center dc3 the world’s largest accredited cyber crime laboratory it is also the principal support contractor for the department of homeland security’s us computer emergency readiness team uscert which provides response support to and defense against cyber attacks for us executive branch agencies and information sharing and collaboration with state and local government industry and international partners 

the group’s diverse customer base has stimulated strong growth opportunities in each of its three principal markets including 

 

   revenues for the information systems and technology group were 34 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 and 2009 and 36 percent in 2010 revenues by major products and services were as follows 

 

   

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 9 

 

  

customers 

in 2010 72 percent of our revenues were from the us government 10 percent were from us commercial customers 8 percent were directly from international defense customers and the remaining 10 percent were from international commercial customers 

us government 

our primary customers are the us department of defense and the us intelligence community we have also developed relationships with other us government customers including the department of homeland security centers for medicare  medicaid services national aeronautics and space administration and several firstresponder agencies our revenues from the us government were as follows 

 

  

 we perform our us government business under fixedprice costreimbursement and timeandmaterials contracts our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses us for allowable costs and pays a fixed fee or an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for materials costs 

fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 55 percent of our us government business in both 2009 and 2010 costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 38 percent in 2009 and 39 percent in 2010 and timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent in 2009 and 6 percent in 2010 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels as we are required to absorb cost overruns should they occur therefore these types of contracts offer us additional profits if we can complete the work for less than the contract amount costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk they also can include fee schedules that allow the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy certain performance criteria however not all costs are reimbursed under these types of contracts and the government carefully reviews the costs we charge in addition the negotiated base fees associated with costreimbursement contracts are generally lower consistent with our lower risk under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual laborhour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates additionally because we often charge materials costs with little or no fee the content mix can impact the profit margins associated with these contracts 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 41 billion in 2008 33 billion in 2009 and 32 billion in 2010 this represented approximately 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 and 10 percent in both 2009 and 2010 the majority of these revenues are for businessjet aircraft where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries other commercial products include drivetrain components and aftermarket parts in our combat systems group jones act ships in our marine systems group and ruggedized mobile computing solutions in our information systems and technology group 

international 

our direct revenues from government and commercial customers outside the united states were 51 billion in 2008 and 6 billion in both 2009 and 2010 this represented approximately 17 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 19 percent in 2009 and 18 percent in 2010 

we conduct business with government customers around the world with primary subsidiary operations in australia austria brazil canada france germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus defense subsidiaries are committed to developing longterm relationships with their respective governments and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers 

our international commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded significantly in recent years particularly in emerging markets including the asiapacific region while the united states continues to be our largest market for business aircraft orders from customers outside north america represent a growing segment of our aircraft business approximately 60 percent of total orders and backlog in 2010

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in both the defense and businessjet aircraft markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

       defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers based in the countries where we operate our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has one primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also partners or subcontracts on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we also are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants in the team or as a provider of a specific hardware such as military vehicles provided by combat systems or a subsystem element such as core mission systems provided by information systems and technology 

another competitive factor in the defense market is the us government’s use of multipleaward indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts to provide customers with flexible procurement options idiq contracts allow the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a program and establish an overall spending limit when the government awards idiq contracts to multiple bidders under the same program we must compete to be selected as a participant in the program and subsequently compete for individual delivery orders this contracting model is most common among our information systems and technology group’s customers but is also being used in programs for which our combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft manufacturing market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has several competitors for each of its products with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality global footprint and timeliness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes worldwide in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price service quality and timeliness in its maintenance repair and overhaul mro and fixedbase operations fbo business the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in its completions business the group competes with original equipment manufacturers oems as well as other thirdparty providers

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

 

 research and development 

to foster innovative product development and evolution we conduct sustained rd activities as part of our normal business operations in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs in our defense businesses we conduct both customersponsored rd activities under us government contracts and companysponsored rd in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of companysponsored rd expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts for more information on our rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

we develop technology manufacturing processes and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by our patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material impact on our business 

employees 

on december 31 2010 we had approximately 90000 employees onefifth of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives agreements covering approximately 3 percent of total employees are due to expire during 2011 historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption of operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on pricing effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks through longterm agreements with our suppliers by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts and by procuring from our suppliers jointly across our business groups to achieve economies of scale we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not generally seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s octobertoseptember fiscal year this process has historically resulted in higher revenues in the latter half of the year internationally many of our government customers schedule deliveries toward the end of the calendar year resulting in increasing revenues and earnings over the course of the year

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

     in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far also subjects us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as certain us policies and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control including the international traffic in arms regulations itar 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally including the european aviation safety agency easa for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type for safety reasons if they believe the aircraft does not meet their standards maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of some materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are allowable and recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to allowable costs we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters see note n to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are however some risks that apply more specifically to general dynamics based on our type of business 

because three of our four business groups serve the defense market our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks in our aerospace group’s market we face risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

we depend on the us government for a significant portion of our revenues in each of the past three years more than twothirds of our revenues were from the us government us defense spending historically has been driven by perceived threats to national security while the country has been under an elevated threat level in recent years there is no assurance that defense budgets will be sustained at current levels in addition competing demands for federal funds could pressure all areas of spending which could further impact the defense budget 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings 

us government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and are subject to termination our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract second future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings 

we are subject to audit by the us government us government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors these agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts cost structure and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards the us government also reviews the adequacy of and a contractor’s compliance with its internal control systems and policies including the contractor’s purchasing property estimating labor accounting and information systems in some cases audits may result in costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations of improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government in addition we could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft our aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by business individual and government customers in the united states and around the world the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets if customers default on existing contracts and our aerospace group is unable to replace those contracts the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced as a result 

  

14 general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 

 

  

  

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess 

 

     if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we face unexpected contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected this could affect our earnings and margins if we fail to adequately manage the risks under our contracts particularly fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may be adversely affected 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements occasionally we rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes government customers in newly formed freemarket economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature which can complicate the contracting process in this context our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s leadership national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenues and earnings associated with our international business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers virtually all of the products that we produce and sell are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and systemintegration techniques and capabilities the commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 

developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance while we maintain insurance for some business risks it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities where permitted by applicable laws we seek indemnification from the us government in addition we may seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 we may elect to provide products or services even in instances where we are unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification 

we have made and expect to continue to make investments including acquisitions and joint ventures that involve risks and uncertainties these activities particularly in the current environment of increased governmental regulation and enforcement both domestically and abroad may expose us to legal and regulatory risks that are different from the risks we currently experience in our existing businesses when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors including our integration of the businesses involved the performance of the underlying products capabilities or technologies and market conditions following the acquisition although we believe we have established appropriate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks and have a proven track record of successful acquisitions and investments unanticipated performance issues and acquired liabilities associated with these activities could adversely affect our financial results

business environment 

the nation’s engagement in combating threats to us national security around the world coupled with the need to equip and modernize us military forces drives department of defense funding levels as a defense contractor our financial performance is influenced by the allocation and prioritization of us defense spending for fiscal year fy 2011 the president requested 549 billion for the department of defense including approximately 189 billion for procurement and research and development rd procurement and rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of our us defense revenues 

as of february 18 2011 the congress has not approved the president’s fy 2011 budget request consequently the us government including the department of defense is operating under a continuing resolution cr which funds the pentagon at fy 2010 funding levels through early march 2011 for fy 2010 congress appropriated 531 billion for the defense department including approximately 185 billion for investment accounts we anticipate that congress will further consider the fy 2011 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current cr this consideration would likely result in either an extension of the cr thereby keeping fy 2011 funding at fy 2010 levels or the passage of a 2011 funding bill in the case of an extended cr we are actively engaged with our customers and the congress to ensure funding required for critical programs is not disrupted in either case budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years 

to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq defense budgets have also included supplemental funding while some of our programs have received supplemental funds most of our funding is now derived from base budgets for fy 2011 the president has requested approximately 159 billion in supplemental funding including approximately 16 percent for investment accounts futureyear spending plans forecast a reduction in supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration’s plan to gradually reduce troop levels in iraq and afghanistan 

for fy 2012 the president has requested total defense funding of 671 billion including 118 billion in supplemental funding the 2012 budget requests 188 billion for investment accounts the pentagon’s fiveyear base spending plan submitted with the fy 2012 funding request reflects lowsingledigit growth in the nearterm with growth slowing in later years this plan incorporates approximately 78 billion of projected cuts when compared with the previous fiveyear plan given force structure levels and current threat levels the majority of those cuts are not manifested in investment accounts rather investment accounts are projected to display lowsingledigit growth over the fiveyear period with procurement funding for mature programs growing and rd funding for developmental programs declining over the period 

in today’s dynamic budget environment the success of our us defense business is enhanced by the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded while our nation’s budget deficits will influence government spending decisions we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following 

 

     given today’s tenuous geopolitical landscape governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to diverse defense export opportunities we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies both from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses while the revenue potential can be significant international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing changing priorities and overall spending pressures as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world we expect our international sales and exports to grow

businessjet market conditions continued to improve in 2010 in line with the broader economic recovery particularly in the largecabin market our aerospace group benefitted from increased flying hours higher aircraft services activity improved newaircraft order interest and declining customer defaults barring any further economic turmoil we believe the diversity and duration of our businessjet backlog positions the aerospace group for further improvement in 2011 and beyond continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive aerospace’s longterm growth particularly as the group begins producing its newest aircraft offerings the g250 and the g650 in 2011 similarly we believe that aircraftservice revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed businessjet fleet 

in these dynamic markets we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth margin improvement and efficient conversion of earnings into cash our record of excellent cashflow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations focuses on the material financial measures we use to evaluate our performance including revenues operating earnings and margins cash flow and orders and backlog a consolidated overview is followed by a more detailed review of operating performance for each of our business groups aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology for the aerospace group results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed for the defense business groups the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with supplemental discussion of specific significant contracts and programs that drive the groups’ results 

in the aerospace group we recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s aircraft outfitting and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service changes in revenues in this group result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries both green and outfitted the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities the level of service activity during the period and the number of preowned aircraft sold 

in general operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midcabin aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed the number and type of preowned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group which include selling expenses and rd costs 

in the defense business groups the majority of the revenues are generated by longterm government contracts we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as a result changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume yearoveryear variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 

operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume performance or contract mix ie higher vs lowermargin work performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract or the estimated costs required to complete the contract contract mix can result in higher or lower earnings and margins due to contract type eg fixedpricecostreimbursable or the phase of work eg developmentproduction within those contracts the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event caused a change in the profitability of a contract eg contract lossesclaims

consolidated overview 

review of 2010 vs 2009 

 

 general dynamics’ revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 with higher revenues in the aerospace marine systems and information systems and technology groups offset in part by lower combat systems revenues aerospace revenues improved primarily due to higher aircraft services volume growing activity in marine systems’ us navy ship programs resulted in increased revenues for the group in 2010 increases across the information systems and technology portfolio contributed to revenue growth in the group in 2010 particularly in the tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses revenues decreased in the combat systems group due primarily to reduced volume on us military vehicle programs 

our operating earnings growth significantly outpaced our sales growth in 2010 each of our four business groups reported earnings growth compared with 2009 earnings performance was particularly strong in the aerospace and combat systems groups both of which realized significant operating leverage in 2010 in the aerospace group operating margins were up due to improved pricing on aircraft services work and largecabin aircraft deliveries and the absence of preowned aircraft losses which negatively impacted 2009 operating margins combat systems’ 2010 margin expansion resulted from productivity improvements across the group particularly in the us military vehicle business and a favorable contract mix including reduced engineering and development work operating margins were steady in the marine systems group and down slightly in the information systems and technology group due to a shift in contract mix as a result our overall operating margins increased by 70 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 in 2009 strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset reduced businessjet deliveries in the aerospace group resulting in significant topline revenue growth over 2008 the combat systems and marine systems groups generated doubledigit revenue growth on the strength of military vehicle and shipbuilding and repair programs in the information systems and technology group increased volume in each of the group’s us operations drove the group’s revenue growth revenues decreased in the aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries in response to a significant downturn in the businessjet market 

our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008 as earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was offset by reduced earnings in the aerospace group overall our operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008 operating margins were up significantly in the marine systems group due to strong program execution while margins were steady in the information systems and technology group and down in the combat systems and aerospace groups 

cash flow 

cash flows from operations in 2010 exceeded net earnings for the 12 th consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities was 31 billion in 2008 29 billion in 2009 and 3 billion in 2010 over the threeyear period we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay maturing debt our net debt debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was 378 at yearend 2010 compared with 

  

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 21 

 

  

12 billion at the end of 2009 this decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployment activities 12 billion of share repurchases 631 of dividends paid 508 of companysponsored research and development 370 of capital expenditures 335 of contributions to our retirement plans and 233 spent on acquisitions during the year 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog including funded and unfunded portions was 596 billion at the end of 2010 compared with 655 billion at yearend 2009 strong orders across our defense businesses resulted in a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenues higher than 2009 despite increased revenues in 2010 orders in our defense businesses were complemented by improving order activity in the aerospace group particularly in the second half of the year 

the aerospace group’s total backlog was 178 billion at the end of 2010 compared with 193 billion at yearend 2009 aerospace funded backlog was 174 billion at the end of 2010 compared with 189 billion at the end of 2009 aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer net orders adjusted for customer defaults increased sequentially each quarter in 2010 however aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010 resulting in the backlog decline the aerospace unfunded backlog of 378 at the end of 2010 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

the total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2010 to 418 billion at the end of the year compared with 462 billion at the end of 2009 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts over half of the decline in our defense backlog during 2010 was in marine systems which traditionally receives large multiyear awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods the funded portion of the defense backlog was 259 billion at the end of 2010 this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 

our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 

customers use idiq contracts for several reasons including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements which set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of our estimated potential contract value is composed of multipleaward idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders we include only our estimate of the value we will receive under these arrangements the estimated contract value also includes idiq contracts for which we have been designated as the solesource supplier to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies we believe our customers intend to fully implement these products and systems because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts if the customer exercises the option these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

on december 31 2010 the estimated potential contract value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 218 billion up significantly from 176 billion at the end of 2009 this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower the estimated potential contract value in the combat systems group doubled from yearend 2009 while the information systems and technology group’s estimated potential contract value increased nearly 20 percent we expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future 

other information 

net interest expense was 66 in 2008 160 in 2009 and 157 in 2010 additional debt issued in 2008 and 2009 resulted in the increase from 2008 to 2009 the decrease in 2010 was due largely to the repayment of 700 of fixedrate notes in the third quarter of 2010 

  

22 general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 

 

  

we expect net interest expense of approximately 135 to 140 in 2011 subject to capital deployment activities during the year 

our effective tax rate was 312 percent in 2008 315 percent in 2009 and 307 percent in 2010 the 2008 rate included a 35 or approximately 009 pershare benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent in 2011 for additional discussion of tax matters see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell our spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of 11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale the sale of this operation was completed in 2010 our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with this divested business we have presented the operating results of this business along with the loss from the sale as discontinued operations net of income taxes 

review of business groups 

aerospace 

review of 2010 vs 2009 

 

 the aerospace group’s revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to steady growth in aircraft services activity throughout the year aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues remained consistent with 2009 levels with an increase in manufacturing volume offset by reduced outfitting work aircraft manufacturing revenues increased 9 percent in 2010 the result of additional deliveries and a more favorable mix of green gulfstream aircraft the decline in aircraft outfitting revenues was associated primarily with the group’s completions work for other original equipment manufacturers oems reflecting decreased oem production across the broader businessjet market 

aircraft services revenues which include both gulfstream and jet aviation’s maintenance and repair work fixedbase operations and aircraft management services increased 15 percent in 2010 reflecting the growing installed base of businessjet aircraft and increased utilization as the businessjet market recovers following the economic downturn revenues from sales of preowned aircraft were down slightly from 2009 

the group’s operating earnings improved significantly in 2010 compared with 2009 with improvements in all areas of the group’s portfolio the components of the earnings growth were as follows 

 

 the group’s aircraft manufacturing and outfitting earnings were up in 2010 compared with 2009 due to the increase in aircraft manufacturing volume as well as improved pricing on largecabin aircraft and mix shift within largecabin models this increase was offset in part by reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults margins for these activities were up 190 basis points compared with 2009 

preowned aircraft earnings improved significantly from 2009 when the group wrote down the carrying value of its preowned aircraft inventory pricing in the preowned market has improved since mid2009 particularly for largecabin aircraft although inventories across the industry remain higher than historic norms in 2010 the aerospace group realized modest profits on its preowned sales took no preowned aircraft writedowns and ended the year with no preowned aircraft in inventory 

consistent with the increased volume aircraft services earnings continued to improve from 2009 margins associated with aircraft services were up 70 basis points in 2010 due to improved marketplace pricing 

the group’s operating earnings in 2010 were also favorably impacted by the timing of rd expenditures and the absence of severance costs associated with workforce reductions in 2009 

as a result of the factors discussed above the group’s overall operating margins increased 250 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 the aerospace group’s revenues decreased in 2009 the result of a decline in sales of gulfstream aircraft that was offset in part by the addition of jet aviation which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 we reduced gulfstream’s 2009 aircraft production primarily in the group’s midcabin 

  

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 23 

 

  

models in response to the market downturn in late 2008 as a result aircraftmanufacturing revenues decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 gulfstream aircraftservices revenues were down in 2009 due to reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance 

the group’s operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above the earnings decline associated with decreased gulfstream aircraft deliveries was mitigated by costreduction initiatives liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts and the fact that the majority of the reduction in deliveries was in our lowermargin midcabin aircraft as a result aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year aircraft services earnings were steady as the addition of jet aviation offset a decrease at gulfstream however competitive marketplace pressures reduced margins operating earnings in 2009 were also negatively impacted by losses on preowned aircraft inventories and severance costs associated with workforce reductions overall the group’s operating margins decreased 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the aerospace group finished 2010 with a total backlog of 178 billion of which 174 billion was funded the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft in 2010 since the introduction of the g650 in 2008 customer demand improved throughout the year with net orders adjusted for customer defaults improving sequentially in each quarter of 2010 however aircraft deliveries exceeded net orders in 2010 resulting in the backlog decline we expect net order activity to remain strong in 2011 the group’s largecabin backlog remains well positioned with an 18 to 24month period between customer order and aircraft delivery while improving conditions in the midcabin market remain difficult though these aircraft represent a small share of the group’s portfolio order activity has been further strengthened by the group’s newest aircraft models the g650 and the g250 both of these aircraft continue to perform well in flight testing and remain on track for 2011 aircraft certification the g250 and the g650 are scheduled to enter service in 2011 and 2012 respectively 

over the past few years the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse both in customer type and geographic region approximately twothirds of the group’s yearend backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers though we are seeing renewed interest from large public companies while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america international customers comprise nearly 60 percent of the group’s backlog with growing order interest in emerging markets particularly from the asiapacific region 

total backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or longterm agreements with fleet customers these arrangements totaled 14 billion at the end of 2010 and are included in estimated potential contract value 

2011 outlook 

we expect an increase of approximately 15 to 16 percent in the group’s revenues in 2011 compared with 2010 the result of increased largecabin aircraft deliveries including initial green deliveries of the g650 and continued growth in aircraft services activity we expect the aerospace group’s margins to be in the mid to high15 percent range down modestly from 2010 due to reduced liquidated damages associated with fewer customer defaults and increasing service activity 

combat systems 

review of 2010 vs 2009 

 

 the combat systems group’s revenues were down in 2010 compared with 2009 due to reduced volume in the group’s us and european military vehicle businesses the decrease in the group’s revenues consisted of the following 

 

 in the group’s us military vehicle business lower mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle production and reduced engineering work represented the majority of the decline in revenues from 2009 the group’s deliveries of mrap vehicles have fluctuated over the past two years in response to the customer’s urgent deployment needs the reduction in activity on engineering programs related primarily to the 2009 cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs 

  

24 general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 

 

  

program and decreased volume on the marine corps’ expeditionary fighting vehicle efv these declines were offset in part by increased volume on the group’s foreign military sales fms contracts to provide light armored vehicles lavs and tanks to international customers 

revenues were steady in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses increased sales of axles largely in the military market and higher demand for the group’s propellant products and munitions in canada were offset in part by lower armor kit production and the completion of deliveries of detection systems that protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 

revenues in the group’s european military vehicle business decreased in 2010 as a result of the rampdown of the leopard tank program for the spanish government and lower activity on the group’s pandur and piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers increased activity on other vehicle contracts including the eagle vehicle for germany helped offset these decreases 

despite the decline in revenues the combat systems group’s operating earnings increased slightly in 2010 productivity improvements across the group particularly in the us military vehicle business and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin improvement in 2010 the group’s operating margins increased 130 basis points in 2010 compared with 2009 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 in 2009 the combat systems group’s revenues increased significantly compared with 2008 due to strong contributions from each of the group’s businesses in the group’s us military vehicle business increased stryker wheeled combat vehicle and abrams main battle tank volume was the primary contributor of the revenue growth revenues were up in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to the acquisition of axletech international in december 2008 increased production of armor kits and an increase in deliveries of hydra70 rockets the group’s european military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009 as a result of higher activity on several wheeled vehicle production programs 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings grew in 2009 though at a lower rate than revenues resulting in a 50 basispoint decrease in operating margins compared with 2008 the operating margins in 2008 were influenced by a favorable program mix in the us military vehicle business 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the combat systems group’s total backlog was 118 billion at the end of 2010 down from 134 billion at yearend 2009 funded backlog decreased 5 percent in 2010 to 109 billion at year end the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2016 

the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised 18 billion of the group’s backlog at year end including the production of vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012 the group received over 17 billion of stryker orders in 2010 including awards for contractor logistics support vehicle production and engineering services stryker orders in 2010 also included awards for stryker doublevhulled vehicles designed and developed in quick response to the customer’s urgent deployment requirements 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included 17 billion for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs these programs include the m1a2 system enhancement package sep under which we retrofit abrams tanks with improved electronics commandandcontrol capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tanks’ effectiveness the group continued work in 2010 on a multiyear contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining m1a1 abrams tanks to the sep configuration approximately half of the group’s abrams backlog at year end was for the sep program in 2010 the group received awards from the army totaling 380 for all abramsrelated programs 

the group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 400 under the mrap program largely for upgrade kits for previously delivered rg31 vehicles and 305 for the efv program 

the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog the backlog at the end of the year included 

 

     

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 25 

 

  

   the combat systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 26 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs in 2010 the group received awards totaling approximately 275 for the production of hydra70 rockets the group also received awards worth approximately 180 from the canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition 150 from the army for armor for stryker and bradley vehicles and 75 from the army for production of m2a1 machine guns 

combat systems backlog does not include approximately 46 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with the group’s anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options the group’s estimated potential contract value doubled since yearend 2009 due to contracts awarded in 2010 including the specialist vehicle and hydra70 rocket programs 

2011 outlook 

we expect combat systems revenues to remain in the 9 billion range in 2011 with growth in international vehicle contracts steady volume on us weapons and munitions programs and a reduction in volume on some of the group’s us vehicle programs we expect the group’s operating margins to be approximately 14 percent down modestly from 2010 due to a shift in program mix 

marine systems 

review of 2010 vs 2009 

 

 the marine systems group’s revenues increased in 2010 compared with 2009 as growth in several us navy programs offset a decline in commercial ship construction the increase in revenues consisted of the following 

 

 the group’s multiyear shipconstruction programs for the us navy include virginiaclass submarines ddg51 and ddg1000 destroyers and take combatlogistics ships the principal driver of revenue growth in 2010 was increased activity on the virginiaclass program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year in 2011 the group delivered the seventh boat under the program in 2010 while construction continued on the next five boats deliveries of the remaining 11 boats under contract are scheduled through 2018 

in our surface combatant business volume decreased on the ddg51 arleigh burke program as the current multiship contract nears completion offsetting this decline was an increase in activity on the group’s design and construction contract for the first ddg1000 zumwaltclass destroyer the remaining two ddg51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery in 2011 and 2012 and the first ddg1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014 

activity on the group’s take program was down in 2010 as construction continued on the remaining four ships the group delivered the ninth and 10th ships in 2010 and deliveries of the last four ships are scheduled through 2012 in 2010 the group also began advanced design efforts for the mobile landing platform mlp program 

in addition to these shipconstruction programs revenues were up significantly in 2010 on the group’s engineering programs particularly work associated with the nextgeneration ballisticmissile submarine ssbn the group is performing initial concept studies including design of a common missile compartment for both the us navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom the group’s ship repair work has remained steady in 2010 following significant growth in 2009 

in 2010 the group completed construction on the final two ships of a fiveship commercial productcarrier contract given the success of this program the age of the fleet of jones act ships and environmental regulations that require doublehull tankers and impose emission control limits we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities as the economy recovers 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased in 2010 consistent with the increase in revenues operating margins remained steady compared with 2009 though the group is undergoing a shift in contract mix activity on the group’s destroyer programs is moving from the fixedprice ddg51 program to the costreimbursable ddg1000 contract and the virginiaclass program is transitioning from the mature block ii contract to the block iii contract favorable performance on the take and commercial product carrier programs in 2010 helped offset this mix shift 

  

26 general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 

 

  

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 revenues were up significantly in 2009 across the marine systems group increased activity on the virginiaclass program in preparation of starting construction of two submarines per year contributed almost twothirds of the group’s increase in 2009 revenues volume also increased on the ddg1000 and the group’s engineering and repair programs for the navy lower activity on the ddg51 and take programs slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2009 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased significantly in 2009 as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its businesses the group increased program earnings rates in 2009 on the virginiaclass ddg51 ddg1000 and commercial product carrier programs these improvements increased the group’s overall margins by 70 basis points in 2009 a significant improvement following a 100basis point margin increase in 2008

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years for example in 2008 the group received a 14 billion contract for the construction of eight virginiaclass submarines to be delivered through 2018 increasing backlog to an alltime high of 264 billion at the end of 2008 consistent with this historical pattern as the group has performed on these multiyear contracts the backlog has decreased to 201 billion at yearend 2010 the group’s funded backlog was 71 billion at the end of both 2009 and 2010 

the virginiaclass submarine program was the group’s largest program in 2010 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 137 billion for 11 virginiaclass submarines as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner 

navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog these include the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and zumwaltclass ddg1000 destroyer programs the group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included 855 for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first ddg1000 in 2010 the group received approximately 420 in orders under the ddg1000 program including continued engineering and support services longlead construction for the second ship and longlead material for the third ship the group expects to be awarded construction contracts for the second and third ddg1000 ships in 2011 at year end the backlog also included approximately 220 for the remaining two ddg51 destroyers under contract the navy plans to continue the ddg51 program and the group expects to receive an award for an additional ddg51 in 2011 following funding for longlead material for this ship in 2010 

the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 965 for the four remaining ships under the navy’s take combatlogistics ship program in 2010 we received construction contracts for the last two ships of the program the yearend backlog also included approximately 340 for the group’s second ship under the navy’s littoral combat ship lcs program scheduled for delivery in 2012 and 95 for the mlp program the navy plans to build three mlp auxiliary support ships and the contract for construction of the first ship is scheduled to be awarded in 2011 

in addition the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 39 billion for engineering repair overhaul and other services including engineering and design efforts for the nextgeneration ssbn 

2011 outlook 

we expect the marine systems group’s revenues in 2011 to remain near 2010 levels as increased virginiaclass production and submarine engineering activity is offset by lower ddg51 take and commercial volume we expect the group’s operating margins to decline to the low9 percent range due to the continued mix shift in shipconstruction programs

information systems and technology 

review of 2010 vs 2009 

 

 the information systems and technology group generated strong topline growth in 2010 with over 5 percent organic growth the increase in revenues over 2009 was driven by the group’s tactical communication systems and information technology services businesses 

 

 revenues in the tactical communication systems business increased significantly in 2010 due to higher volume in battlefield communication programs in particular the warfighter information network–tactical wint mobile communication network and ruggedized computing products revenues in the group’s united kingdombased operations also increased in 2010 as work began on the demonstration phase of the uk ministry of defence specialist vehicle program 

in the it services business volume increased on the group’s it support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the networkcentric solutions netcents program which provides network support for federal agencies revenues also increased in this business as a result of the base realignment and closure brac facility changes including work on the new campus east nce contract for the national geospatialintelligence agency and the walter reed national military medical center relocation and fort belvoir community hospital outfitting for the army 

revenues were up in 2010 compared with 2009 in the group’s isr business as a result of the acquisition of axsys technologies inc in the third quarter of 2009 the group also experienced growth in cyberrelated programs across its businesses in 2010 including systems that prevent network attacks increase situational awareness and reduce network vulnerability 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings increased in 2010 although at a slightly lower rate than revenues resulting in a modest decrease in margins compared with 2009 the reduction in margins resulted from a shift in the group’s contract mix to include a growing proportion of it services work 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 the information systems and technology group generated revenue growth in each of the group’s market segments in 2009 organic growth of more than 4 percent was augmented by acquisitions in the group’s it services and isr businesses revenues increased on the wint program and groundbased satellite communications programs in the group’s tactical communication business in the it services business higher volume on several it infrastructure and support contracts including nce and netcents accounted for the increase in revenues growing levels of cyber securityrelated work and higher activity on several classified programs contributed to the growth in the group’s isr business 

operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009 resulting in operating margins of 107 percent consistent with 2008 higher margins in the tactical communications and isr businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix were offset by decreased margins in the it services business 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the information systems and technology group received the highest level of orders in the group’s history in 2010 generating a booktobill ratio of nearly onetoone as a result the group ended the year with a backlog of 98 billion after reporting recordlevel revenues in 2010 the group’s backlog does not include approximately 152 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options in 2010 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 43 billion to the group’s backlog or nearly 40 percent of the group’s orders the estimated potential contract value in the information systems and technology group increased nearly 20

percent from yearend 2009 due most notably to unexercised options associated with the uk specialist vehicle and combat and seaframe control systems for the independence class of ships under the lcs program when combined with backlog the group’s total estimated potential contract value increased by 8 percent over 2009 to 25 billion 

unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that largely have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards while the group has relatively few largescale longterm programs there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business 

programs for the uk ministry of defence comprised approximately 835 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2010 most notably the bowman and the specialist vehicle programs the group has successfully fielded the bowman communications system the secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces and is now performing maintenance and longterm support and enhancement activities for the program in 2010 the ministry of defence awarded the group a contract for the demonstration phase of its specialist vehicle program in this phase the group will manage the design integration and production of seven prototype vehicles work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the combat systems group including a significant portion of the future vehicle production effort 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2010 included approximately 645 for the army’s wint program information systems and technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network designed to provide warfighters with fast secure mobile commandandcontrol capabilities in 2010 the group received approximately 405 of awards for wint bringing the total program value to 27 billion the backlog does not include 920 of estimated potential contract value for the wint program awarded under an idiq format 

approximately 340 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp under the mhp program the group is providing integrated mission systems training and support for 28 stateoftheart helicopters that are intended to replace canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 225 for the common hardwaresoftware iii chs3 program to provide commercial and ruggedized computers network equipment and software to the us armed forces and other us federal agencies in 2010 the group received over 500 in orders under this program bringing the total contract value to more than 24 billion 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2010 included approximately 960 for a number of facility infrastructure and support programs including nce netcents and the walter reed national military medical center and mark center facilities 

in addition to these programs the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2010 including the following 

 

      information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2010 including the following

   2011 outlook 

we expect revenues in the information systems and technology group to grow approximately 3 to 5 percent in 2011 we expect each of the group’s businesses to contribute to the growth particularly in the areas of it support services for intelligence and federal civilian customers and tactical communication systems the group’s operating margins are expected to decline slightly but remain above 10 percent based on the projected contract mix in 2011 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options corporate operating expenses totaled 75 in 2008 87 in 2009 and 83 in 2010 see note o to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock options we expect 2011 corporate operating expenses of approximately 90 to 95 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

in the mid1990s general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses this has resulted in a larger more diversified company incorporating new products and technologies that meet the needs of an expanded customer base we continue to place a strong emphasis on cash generation and capital allocation and deployment this focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities 

 

  

   our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the spanish government as collateral our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and highquality corporate municipal and us governmentsponsored debt securities the marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa we have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three years as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

30 general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 

 

  

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 31 billion in 2008 29 billion in 2009 and 3 billion in 2010 in all three years the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings in 2008 and 2009 increasing levels of customer deposits particularly in the aerospace group reduced our operating working capital owc and increased our operating cash flow in addition 2009 cash from operating activities reflected the collection of approximately 150 from the czech republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide pandur ii wheeled vehicles 

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to our expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories we along with the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 15 billion at december 31 2010 if this were the outcome we would owe half of the total or approximately 14 billion pretax our aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 725 we believe we have sufficient resources including access to capital markets to pay such an obligation if required 

investing activities 

we used 37 billion in 2008 14 billion in 2009 and 408 in 2010 for investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities 

business acquisitions in 2008 we completed five acquisitions for a total of 32 billion in 2009 we completed two acquisitions for 811 in 2010 we completed three acquisitions for 233 we financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions 

capital expenditures capital expenditures were 490 in 2008 385 in 2009 and 370 in 2010 the decrease in 2009 and 2010 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the aerospace and marine systems groups during 2010 the aerospace group announced a new 500 sevenyear facilities expansion project at the group’s savannah campus we expect capital expenditures of approximately 550 in 2011 less than 2 percent of revenues 

marketable securities as a result of lower market interest rates we have expanded our investments in availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities in recent years to generate additional return net salesmaturities of these securities were 17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of 235 in 2009 and net salesmaturities of 115 in 2010 

financing activities 

we used 718 in 2008 806 in 2009 and 22 billion in 2010 for financing activities our financing activities include issuances and repayments of debt payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 

debt proceeds net in 2008 we issued 904 of commercial paper primarily to fund acquisitions during the year during that year we also repaid 500 of fixedrate notes 150 of senior notes and 20 of term debt on their scheduled maturity dates we issued 1 billion of fiveyear fixedrate notes in december 2008 and another 750 of twoyear fixedrate notes in june 2009 we used the proceeds from the fixedrate notes for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings in august 2010 we repaid 700 of fixedrate notes on their scheduled maturity date 

we ended 2010 with no commercial paper outstanding and our total debt balance was down approximately 660 from 2009 resulting in a debttoequity ratio of 241 percent down 7 percentage points from yearend 2009 we have approximately 2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 

the next material repayment of longterm debt is 750 of fixedrate notes scheduled to mature in july of 2011 as we approach the maturity date we will determine whether to repay these notes with cash on hand or refinance the obligation see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities 

dividends our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 042 per share on march 3 2010 the 13 th consecutive annual increase the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to 038 per share in march 2009 and 035 per share in march 2008 

share repurchases our board of directors has historically supported management’s tactical repurchase of our shares typically in repurchase authorizations of 10 millionshare increments we repurchased 20 million shares on the open market in 2008 36 million shares in 2009 and 189 million shares in 2010 as a result we reduced our shares outstanding by 35 percent in the past year and by 8 percent since 2008 on february 2 2011 the board authorized management to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares about 3 percent of our total shares outstanding we expect to continue to repurchase shares as part of our capital deployment activities in the future

nongaap management metrics 

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns in 2010 for the 12 th consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares as described below we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and to earn a return on the deployment of that capital 

free cash flow we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

 over the past five years we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period an average 106 percent conversion rate we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy 

return on invested capital we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense as a result of our continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment roic has grown 190 basis points since 2006 roic for 2006 through 2010 is calculated as follows

 application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition we account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit 

  

general dynamics annual report Ÿ 2010 33 

 

  

over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we use such output measures otherwise we use input measures 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 

we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including general and administrative expenses on government contracts 

we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our longterm contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned while we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years most contractors use the cumulative catchup method 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on our best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts we review our contract estimates regularly to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 

goodwill since 1995 we have acquired 57 businesses at a total cost of approximately 21 billion including three in 2010 in connection with these acquisitions we have recognized 126 billion of goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 

the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units these estimates require the use of judgment we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “topdown” analyses including a market assessment of our enterprise value beyond the annual impairment test we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future the fair value of each of our reporting units on december 31 2010 substantially exceeded its carrying value 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts and recovered from the government we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and postretirement benefit plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 

we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we had 18 billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on december 31 2009 and 42 billion on december 31 2010 the increase in the amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts is due to significant international contract awards in 2010 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses 

 

 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar eurocanadian dollar and europound sterling exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk 

our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2010 we had 31 billion par value of fixedrate debt we had no commercial paper outstanding on december 31 2010 our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

investment risk 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of one year on december 31 2010 we held 28 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than one month on december 31 2010 a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings historically we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values

general dynamics 2009 annual report 9 

we perform our us government business under costreimbursement timeandmaterials and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses us for allowable costs and pays a fixed fee andor an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for materials costs our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount 

costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 38 percent of our us government business in both 2009 and 2008 timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent in both years and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 55 percent in both years 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk they also can include fee schedules that allow the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy certain performance criteria however not all costs are reimbursed under these types of contracts and the government carefully reviews the costs we charge in addition negotiated base fees are generally lower consistent with our lower risk under timeandmaterials contracts our profit may vary if actual labor hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates additionally because we often charge materials costs with little or no fee the content mix can impact the profit margins associated with these contracts fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels in recognition of the higher risk and offer us additional profits if we can complete the work for less than the contract amount fixedprice contracts require that we absorb cost overruns should they occur 

us commercial 

our us commercial revenues were 33 billion in 2009 41 billion in 2008 and 37 billion in 2007 this represented approximately 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009 and 14 percent in each of 2008 and 2007 the majority of these sales are for gulfstream aircraft this customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in both the defense and businessjet aircraft markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

  

  

  

 defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for defense products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers operating in the local countries our combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has only one primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also partners or subcontracts on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the defense market’s contractbased procurement relationships and the longterm operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

we also are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s system integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants in the team or as a provider of a specific hardware such as military vehicles provided by combat systems or a subsystem element such as core mission systems provided by information systems and technology 

another competitive factor in the defense market is the us government’s use of multipleaward indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts to provide customers with flexible procurement options idiq contracts allow the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a program and establish an overall spending limit when the government awards idiq contracts to multiple bidders under the same program we must compete to be selected as a participant in the program and subsequently compete for individual delivery orders this contracting model is most common among our information systems and technology group’s customers but is also being used in programs for which our combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft manufacturing market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has at least one competitor for each of its products currently in production with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft there are currently no competitors in the group’s ultralargecabin market g650 key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality and timeliness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas 

the aerospace group competes in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on the basis of price service quality and timeliness in its maintenance repair and overhaul mro and fixedbase operations fbo business the group competes worldwide with several other large companies as well as a large number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business in its completions business the aerospace group competes with original equipment manufacturers oems as well as other thirdparty providers 

research and development 

we conduct independent rd activities as part of our normal business operations over the past three years the majority of our companysponsored rd expenditures was in the defense business in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of these expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts we also conduct customersponsored rd activities under us government contracts in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs for more information on our rd activities including our expenditures for the past three years see note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

employees 

on december 31 2009 we had approximately 91700 employees 22 percent of whom work under collective bargaining agreements with various labor representatives agreements covering approximately 7 percent of total employees are due to expire during 2010 historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption of operating activities

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

 

 raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on pricing effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks through longterm agreements with our suppliers or by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s octobertoseptember fiscal year this process has historically resulted in higher revenues in the latter half of the year internationally many of our government customers schedule deliveries toward the end of the calendar year resulting in increasing revenues and earnings over the course of the year 

intellectual property 

we are a leader in the development of innovative products manufacturing technologies and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of us government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by our patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material impact on our business 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far also subjects us to audits and other government reviews these reviews cover issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts the government may use information from these reviews to challenge our contractrelated costs and fees failure to comply with procurement laws or regulations can result in civil criminal 

  

12 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

or administrative proceedings these might involve fines penalties suspension of payments or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as certain us policies and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control including the international traffic in arms regulations itar other factors that can affect international sales include currency exchange fluctuations and political and economic risks 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type for safety reasons if they believe the aircraft does not meet their standards maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of some materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are allowable and recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to allowable costs we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls see note n to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is of course subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are however some risks that apply more specifically to general dynamics based on our type of business 

because three of our four business groups serve the defense market our revenues are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks in our aerospace group’s market we face risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

we depend on the us government for a significant portion of our revenues in each of the past three years over twothirds of our revenues were from the us government us defense spending historically has been driven by perceived threats to national security while the country has been under a sustained elevated threat level in recent years there is no assurance that defense budgets will continue to grow at the pace seen over the past decade in addition competing demands for federal funds could put pressure on all areas of spending which could impact the defense budget 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings 

us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination our us government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract second future revenues under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on future revenues and earnings 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft our aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and individual customers the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets if our aerospace group is unable to replace contracts terminated due to customer defaults with existing contracts in the backlog or new contracts the group’s anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced as a result 

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess 

 

  

  

  

  

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we face unexpected contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected this could affect our earnings and margins 

  

14 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements occasionally we rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes government customers in newly formed freemarket economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature which can complicate the contracting process in this context our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s leadership national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenues and earnings associated with our international business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers virtually all of the products that we produce and sell are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and systemintegration techniques and capabilities the commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 

developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance while we maintain insurance for some business risks it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities where permitted by applicable laws we seek indemnification from the us government in addition we may seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 we may elect to provide products or services even in instances where we are unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification

for an overview of our business groups including a discussion of products and services provided see the business discussion contained in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

management overview 

general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions shipbuilding design repair and construction and information systems technologies and services we operate through four business groups – aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology our primary customers are the us military other us government organizations the armed forces of other nations and a diverse base of corporate government and individual buyers of business aircraft we operate in two primary markets defense and national security and business aviation the majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the us military 

the nation’s engagement in combating terrorism around the world coupled with the need to grow and modernize us military forces has driven department of defense funding levels since 2001 in particular procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of our revenues for fiscal year 2010 the congress appropriated 531 billion for the department of defense including approximately 185 billion for procurement and rd budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years 

to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq defense budgets have also included supplemental funding while some of our programs have received supplemental funds most of our funding is now derived from base budgets for fiscal year 2010 the congress has appropriated approximately 130 billion in supplemental funding including approximately 20 percent for investment accounts the defense department has requested another 33 billion of supplemental funding in 2010 if this second supplemental is approved defense funding for fiscal year 2010 will total approximately 693 billion for fiscal year 2011 the president has requested total defense funding of 708 billion including 159 billion in supplemental funding the 2011 budget requests 189 billion for investment accounts an increase of 2 percent over the fiscal year 2010 appropriation including a nearly 8 percent increase in procurement funding 

in february 2010 the department of defense published the quadrennial defense review qdr an analysis of military priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years this review reiterated the need for the military to prepare for a broad range of security challenges and it prioritized continued investment in warfighting capabilities served by our portfolio of defense programs the pentagon’s fiveyear spending plan also submitted to the congress in february reflects the slow steady growth requirements set forth in the qdr through 2015 the base defense budget is expected to grow at a lowsingledigit rate investment accounts are also projected to display lowsingledigit inflationadjusted growth with procurement funding for mature programs growing and rd funding for new programs declining over the period this fiveyear plan also forecasts a reduction in future supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration’s plan to reduce troop levels in iraq offset somewhat by an increased footprint in afghanistan 

our future growth in the us defense market is driven by the size and allocation of the defense budget the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget our ability to evolve our products to address a fastchanging threat environment and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded while the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 beyond the us defense market governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to significant defense export opportunities we are committed to pursuing opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies while the revenue potential can be significant international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing changing priorities and overall spending pressures as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world we expect our international sales and exports to grow 

the deterioration in the global economic environment in late 2008 and early 2009 significantly impacted the businessaviation market difficult economic conditions tight credit markets and negative businessjet rhetoric 

  

general dynamics 2009 annual report 19 

in the first half of 2009 caused newaircraft orders to decline customers to default on aircraft contracts and preowned aircraft inventories to grow 

businessjet market conditions began to improve in the second half of 2009 in line with the broader financial market recovery improved flying hours increased newaircraft order interest particularly for largecabin aircraft abating customer defaults and higher aircraft service activity helped to stabilize our aerospace business barring any further economic turmoil we believe the diversity and duration of our businessjet order book positions the aerospace group for further improvement in 2010 continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive the aerospace group’s longterm growth particularly when it begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings the g250 scheduled to enter service in 2011 and the g650 scheduled to enter service in 2012 similarly we believe that aircraftservice revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed businessjet fleet 

we are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow general dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cashflow generation has provided us the flexibility to execute our operational strategy and enabled us consistently to deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

consolidated overview 

the following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level the disclosures focus on the material financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups including revenues operating earnings and margins cash flow and orders and backlog for the defense business groups the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers for the aerospace group the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed 

in the defense business groups the majority of the revenues are generated by longterm government contracts as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as a result changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume volume indicates increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 

in the aerospace group we recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s aircraft outfitting and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service similar to our defense businesses changes in revenues in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities the level of service activity during the period and the number of preowned aircraft sold 

operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume performance the mix of contracts eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and the phases of work within those contracts eg developmentproduction performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract andor the estimated costs required to complete the contract the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 

in general operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and completing the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midsize aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed the number and type of preowned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group which include selling expenses and research and development costs

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 general dynamics’ revenues increased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 as strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset the decline in the businessjet market the combat systems group generated the strongest revenue growth from higher volume in its us and european military vehicle programs and the acquisition of axletech international in december 2008 the marine systems group’s revenues were up significantly because of increased activity on us navy and commercial shipbuilding and repair programs across our shipyards in the information systems and technology group increased volume in each of the group’s us operations and recent acquisitions drove the group’s revenue growth revenues decreased in the aerospace group in 2009 following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries – principally midsize aircraft – in response to a significant downturn in the businessjet market in the first half of the year this decline was offset partially by the acquisition of jet aviation in november 2008 

our operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 over 2008 earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was mostly offset by reduced earnings in aerospace operating margins were up significantly in the marine systems group because of improved operating performance at each of our shipyards during the year in the information systems and technology group margins remained consistent with those achieved in 2008 a shift in contract mix in the combat systems group led to reduced margins compared with the prior year the aerospace group’s margins were reduced by a fiveweek furlough at the group’s aircraft assembly operations in the third quarter of 2009 losses associated with preowned aircraft activities and the addition of lowermargin business at jet aviation as a result our overall operating margins decreased by 100 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008 

review of 2008 vs 2007 

 

 we generated solid revenue growth in 2008 compared with 2007 and operating earnings increased at more than twice the rate of revenue growth the aerospace and marine systems groups achieved the most significant jump in revenues as a result of increases in businessjet deliveries and higher activity on shipbuilding programs revenues increased in the combat systems group due to strong demand for us military vehicles and related support services higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the information systems and technology group our operating earnings increased significantly in 2008 and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of 1 billion growth in operating earnings exceeded the revenue growth in each of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance overall our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 125 percent in 2008 

cash flow 

cash flows from operations in 2009 exceeded net earnings for the 11th consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities was 29 billion in 2009 31 billion in 2008 and 3 billion in 2007 over the threeyear period we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay maturing debt our net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities – was 12 billion at yearend 2009 compared with 23 billion at the end of 2008 this 11 billion decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployments 811 spent on acquisitions 577 of dividends paid 520 of companysponsored research and development 385 of capital expenditures approximately 330 of contributions to our retirement plans and 209 of share repurchases during the year

other financial information 

general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of revenues were 61 percent in 2009 59 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2007 ga expenses were 2 billion in 2009 17 billion in 2008 and 16 billion in 2007 we expect 2010 ga to be approximately 6 percent of revenues 

net interest expense increased to 160 in 2009 compared with 66 in 2008 and 70 in 2007 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008 and 2009 and lower interest income reflecting lower market interest rates and a reduced invested cash balance during the year we expect net interest expense of approximately 150 in 2010 subject to capital deployment activities during the year 

our effective tax rate was 315 percent in 2009 312 percent in 2008 and 317 percent in 2007 the 2008 rate included a 35 or approximately 009 pershare benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation which reduced the 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service this settlement resulted in a benefit of 18 or approximately 004 per share which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 315 to 32 percent in 2010 for additional discussion of tax matters see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell our spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of 11 in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale we are awaiting spanish government approval and expect the sale to close in 2010 in 2007 we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately 25 our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses we have presented their operating results along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above as discontinued operations net of income taxes 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

our total backlog was 655 billion at the end of 2009 compared to 741 billion at yearend 2008 funded backlog was 459 billion at year end down from 517 billion at the end of 2008 we received 264 billion of new orders in 2009 the information systems and technology group’s orders were particularly strong in 2009 resulting in a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenues greater than onetoone for the second consecutive year combat systems also had another strong order year driven in part by growing international order activity late in the year 

the total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in 2009 to 462 billion at the end of the year compared with 516 billion at the end of 2008 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts about threequarters of the decline in our defense backlog during 2009 was in marine systems which traditionally receives large multiyear awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods the funded portion of the defense backlog was 27 billion at the end of 2009 down from 299 billion in december 2008 this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 

the aerospace group’s total backlog was 193 billion at the end of 2009 following a record level of 225 billion at yearend 2008 aerospace funded backlog was 189 billion at the end of 2009 compared to 219 billion at the end of 2008 aerospace funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the aerospace unfunded backlog of 433 at the end of 2009 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 

customers use idiq contracts when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements which set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of our estimated potential contract value includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multipleaward idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders the estimated contract value also includes idiq contracts for which we have been designated as the solesource supplier to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies we believe the customers intend to fully implement these systems because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

  

22 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts if the customer exercises the option these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and longterm agreements with fleet customers we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

on december 31 2009 the estimated potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 176 billion up from 168 billion at the end of 2008 this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower we expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years 

review of operating segments 

aerospace 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 the aerospace group’s revenues decreased in 2009 the net result of a 24 percent decline in gulfstream revenues that was offset in part by revenues from jet aviation which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008 the combination of the global economic deterioration and credit crisis along with negative businessjet rhetoric had a significant impact on the businessjet market in 2009 to adjust to the economic conditions and weakened demand we reduced gulfstream’s 2009 aircraft production and delivery schedule primarily in the group’s midsize models to bridge the market downturn this included a fiveweek furlough at the group’s production center in savannah georgia in july and august as a result aircraftmanufacturing revenues decreased 28 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 the economic environment also impacted the group’s aircraft services business organic aircraftservices revenues were down 15 percent in 2009 resulting from reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance the decline in aircraft manufacturing and services revenues was slightly offset by higher preowned aircraft revenues in 2009 the group sold six preowned aircraft for 124 in 2009 compared with two sales for 18 in 2008 

the group’s operating earnings declined in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the factors noted above the components of the reduction in earnings were as follows 

 

 the net decrease in the group’s aircraft manufacturing and completions earnings in 2009 resulted from the reduction in gulfstream aircraft deliveries offset in part by the addition of jet aviation’s aircraft completions and refurbishing business the earnings decline associated with the decreased gulfstream volume was mitigated by costreduction initiatives a shift in the mix of aircraft deliveries toward largecabin aircraft and liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts as a result aircraft manufacturing margins increased in 2009 over 2008 despite the decline in volume during the year the group continues to focus on reducing costs through production improvements and operational efficiencies to maintain aircraftmanufacturing margins 

in late 2008 and early 2009 the supply in the global preowned aircraft market increased significantly putting considerable pressure on pricing as a result the group wrote down the carrying value of its preowned aircraft inventory in 2009 pricing in the preowned market appears to have stabilized in the second half of 2009 particularly for largecabin aircraft the group continues to work to minimize its preowned aircraft exposure with four preowned aircraft valued at 60 remaining in inventory at the end of 2009 

aircraft services earnings were steady in 2009 compared with 2008 as the addition of jet aviation’s maintenance and repair activities fixedbase operations and aircraft management services offset a decrease in organic aircraft services earnings a significant reduction in flight hours in the businessjet market put competitive pressure on aircraft maintenance and repair earnings in 2009 

the group’s operating earnings also were impacted negatively in 2009 by severance costs associated with workforce reduction activities and intangible asset amortization related to the jet aviation acquisition 

the factors discussed above and the addition of lowermargin jet aviation business caused the group’s overall operating margins to decrease 480 basis points in 2009 compared with 2008 

  

general dynamics 2009 annual report 23 

review of 2008 vs 2007 

 

 the aerospace group generated significant revenue growth in 2008 attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007 new aircraft revenues were up 12 percent in 2008 as a result of the increased aircraft production aircraft services volume increased 8 percent over 2007 the acquisition of jet aviation in november 2008 contributed approximately onequarter of the group’s increase in revenues the group’s preowned aircraft revenues were 18 in 2008 down from 78 in 2007 

the aerospace group’s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than revenues in 2008 approximately 157 of the earnings growth resulted from higher newaircraft and aircraftservices volume improved pricing a favorable delivery mix and productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes increased earnings by approximately 105 reduced sales of preowned aircraft and writedowns of preowned aircraft inventory reduced the group’s earnings growth by 25 increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher productdevelopment costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008 also reduced the group’s earnings growth by 26 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the economic turmoil of late 2008 and early 2009 had a significant impact on the businessjet market the collapse of the global economy led some customers in the backlog to default on their contracts and caused some prospective customers to delay aircraft orders both the largecabin and midsize segments experienced a decline in orders in late 2008 and early 2009 however the midsize market experienced the greatest impact largecabin orders improved steadily throughout the year excluding the introduction of the new g650 largecabin orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 reached their highest level since the second quarter of 2008 despite the rebound in order activity resulting in a fullyear booktobill ratio orders divided by revenues greater than onetoone the customer defaults led to a 14 percent decline in the group’s backlog from the end of 2008 the aerospace group ended 2009 with 193 billion of backlog of which 189 billion was funded scheduled largecabin deliveries are sold out through 2010 and well into 2011 conditions in the midsize market remain challenging however these aircraft represent a declining proportion of our portfolio we continually assess aircraft production requirements and will modify the group’s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of the backlog and the businessjet market 

over the past few years the group’s customer base has become increasingly diverse both in customer type and geographic region the group’s yearend backlog is divided approximately evenly among public companies private companies and individual buyers no one customer represents more than 1 percent of the group’s backlog in addition the backlog has shifted toward the international market with customers outside north america comprising almost 60 percent of the backlog the aerospace backlog has also been diversified to include orders for the group’s newest aircraft models – the g650 and the g250 both of these aircraft were introduced in 2008 and achieved their scheduled first flight in the fourth quarter of 2009 initial green deliveries for each are scheduled to begin in 2011 

the backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or longterm agreements with fleet customers these arrangements totaled 14 billion at the end of 2009 and are included in estimated potential contract value 

2010 outlook 

we expect a low to midsingledigit percentage increase in the aerospace group’s revenues in 2010 compared with 2009 we expect to deliver approximately the same number of aircraft with a further shift toward the largecabin models we also anticipate a modest increase in aircraft services activity in 2010 based on the favorable mix of aircraft deliveries and the stabilization of the preowned aircraft market tempered by the pace of ongoing operational improvement efforts at jet aviation we expect the aerospace group’s margins to improve slightly over 2009 to approximately 14 percent these expectations do not assume any recovery in the midsize market in 2010

combat systems 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 the combat systems group’s revenues increased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 the increase in revenues was driven by 125 percent organic growth and the acquisition of axletech international in december 2008 the group received strong contributions to this growth from each of its markets 

 

 increased volume on the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and abrams main battle tank programs generated over half of the group’s revenue growth in 2009 the higher stryker activity was due to increased vehicle production and modernization work under the abrams program the group continued to upgrade m1a1 tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement package sep configuration for the us army and produced more abrams tank kits for egypt the revenue growth in the us military vehicles business was tempered somewhat by lower volume on the group’s mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle deliveries which were completed in the second quarter of 2009 

organic revenues were up in the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to increased production of armor kits for stryker vehicles an increase in deliveries of hydra70 rockets and higher volume on munitions supply contracts for the united states and canada 

the group’s european military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in 2009 revenues increased as a result of higher activity on several wheeled armored vehicle production programs including the piranha for belgium and spain and the eagle for germany volume also increased on the group’s european arms and munitions and mobile bridge programs while activity was down on the leopard tank program with the spanish government 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings grew in 2009 though at a lower rate than revenues resulting in a 50 basispoint decrease in operating margins compared with 2008 the group’s margins in 2008 were unusually high because of a favorable program mix in the us military vehicles business 

review of 2008 vs 2007 

 

 in 2008 the combat systems group’s revenues were up compared with 2007 due to strength in the group’s us military vehicles business the majority of the revenue growth was generated by higher activity on the mrap vehicle program which emerged in late 2007 and several contracts in support of the group’s abrams main battle tank modernization efforts including the sep upgrade and repair and reset work for battledamaged m1 tanks revenues in the group’s weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds revenues increased slightly on the group’s munitions programs over 2007 in the group’s european military vehicles business volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs including the leopard tank program 

the group’s operating earnings grew significantly in 2008 increasing at more than four times the rate of revenue growth during the year while the most significant driver of the group’s earnings growth was improved performance in the us military vehicle business particularly on the mrap and abrams programs each of the group’s businesses generated at least a 100 basispoint increase in margins in 2008 the operating leverage achieved across combat systems’ operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basispoint improvement in the group’s operating margins compared with 2007 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the combat systems group’s total backlog was 134 billion at the end of 2009 down 10 percent from 15 billion at yearend 2008 funded backlog decreased 6 percent in 2009 to 114 billion at year end approximately 930 or 60 percent of the yearoveryear decline in the group’s backlog is attributable to the army’s termination for convenience of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs program the army currently is considering its alternatives for ground combat 

  

general dynamics 2009 annual report 25 

vehicle requirements which we expect will provide additional opportunities for combat systems including the addition of an eighth stryker brigade the group received 86 billion of new orders in 2009 the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2015 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2009 included approximately 28 billion for m1 abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs these include the m1a2 sep system technical support sts and tank urban survivability kit tusk programs under the sep program we retrofit abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics commandandcontrol capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness the group continued work in 2009 on a multiyear contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade the remaining m1a1 abrams tanks to the sep configuration approximately 50 percent of the group’s abrams backlog at year end was for the sep program under the sts program we identify improvements and replace obsolete parts on abrams tanks to maintain the tanks at high operational readiness rates tusk is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments at year end the abrams backlog included a combined 620 for the sts and tusk programs in 2009 the group received awards from the army totaling 580 for all abramsrelated programs including awards to build m1a1 situational awareness sa tanks for the iraqi army and for m1a2 upgrades for saudi arabia 

the army’s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised over 2 billion of the group’s backlog at year end including the production of approximately 700 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012 the group received over 21 billion of stryker orders in 2009 including awards worth approximately 930 for vehicle production 590 for contractor logistics support and 500 for stryker modernization in january 2010 the army awarded the group a contract worth an additional 85 for battledamage assessment repair services and materials for stryker brigades deployed to iraq and afghanistan in february 2010 the army awarded the group an additional 250 to continue stryker logistics support and requested funds to establish an additional stryker brigade combat team 

almost 500 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2009 was for the us marine corps’ expeditionary fighting vehicle efv program the group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the efv program which the group expects to deliver in 2010 

the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog the backlog at the end of the year included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition combat systems was selected in 2009 as the prime contractor and systems integrator for the canadian government’s lav iii upgrade program the program has a potential value of 850 and we expect to receive a contract in 2010 

the combat systems group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 26 billion in weapons systems munitions detection systems and compositestructures programs in 2009 the group received awards totaling 210 for the production of hydra70 rockets bringing the total contract value to date to over 1 billion the group also received awards worth approximately 115 from the canadian government to supply various calibers of training and tactical ammunition and 75 from the army for production of m2hb machine guns 

2010 outlook 

we expect 4 to 5 percent revenue growth in combat systems in 2010 attributable largely to international vehicle contracts and to growing activity in us armament and munitions programs we anticipate a slight decline in the group’s operating margins to the high12 percent range due to a shift in program mix including the startup of several new contracts 

marine systems 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 each of the marine systems group’s shipyards contributed to the group’s strong growth in revenues and operating earnings in 2009 over the prior year the increase in revenues consisted of the following 

 

 the group’s multiyear shipconstruction programs for the us navy include virginiaclass submarines take combatlogistics ships and 

  

26 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

ddg51 and ddg1000 destroyers the virginiaclass program contributed almost twothirds of the group’s increase in revenues the group delivered the sixth boat under the program in 2009 and continued construction on the next five of the remaining 12 boats under contract virginia activity is expected to continue to ramp up as the group moves toward construction of two ships per year starting in 2011 with deliveries scheduled through 2018 activity was down slightly on the take program in 2009 as the group continued construction on the ninth through 12th ships the group delivered the seventh and eighth ships in 2009 and deliveries of the remaining four ships awarded to date are scheduled through 2011 with ships 13 and 14 in 2012 on the destroyer programs revenues were up in 2009 as activity increased significantly on the group’s design and production contracts for the ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer while volume on the ddg51 arleigh burkeclass program decreased consistent with our expectations the first ddg1000 delivery is scheduled in 2014 and the remaining three ddg51 destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011 

in addition to these shipconstruction programs volume was up significantly in 2009 on engineering and repair programs for the navy the growing service requirements of the navy’s aging fleet along with the rebalancing of the fleet to position more ships on the west coast generated significant additional repair volume for our west coast operations 

the group’s commercial shipbuilding activity consists of a fiveship product carrier program activity on this program increased slightly in 2009 as the first three ships were delivered and construction continued on the remaining two ships which are scheduled for delivery in 2010 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings increased significantly in 2009 each of the group’s shipyards has focused on operational efficiency and achieved significant labor and material cost reductions during the year these efforts resulted in higher earnings rates on several key programs in 2009 including the virginiaclass ddg51 ddg1000 and commercial product carrier programs as a result the group’s operating margins increased 70 basis points over 2008 to 101 percent the group’s significant improvement in 2009 followed a 100basis point increase in margins in 2008 over 2007 

review of 2008 vs 2007 

 

 revenues in the marine systems group were up in 2008 as a result of increased activity at each of the group’s shipyards activity increased on the virginiaclass program as the group delivered the fourth and fifth boats in the program in 2008 volume also increased on the take and ddg1000 programs commercial shipbuilding volume was up in 2008 as the group ramped up construction of the first three of its productcarrier ships slightly lower activity on the ddg51 destroyer program and the completion of the group’s ssgn submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008 the marine systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008 increasing operating earnings at double the rate of revenue growth as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the virginia ddg51 take and commercial product carrier programs these improvements increased the group’s overall margins by 100 basis points in 2008 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years for example in 2008 the group received a 14 billion contract for the construction of eight virginiaclass submarines to be delivered through 2018 after reaching an alltime high of 264 billion at the end of 2008 the group’s backlog decreased to 225 billion at yearend 2009 consistent with this historical pattern the group’s funded backlog at the end of 2009 was 71 billion down from 105 billion at yearend 2008 the current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018 

the virginiaclass submarine program was our largest single program in 2009 and is the largest contract in the group’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 163 billion for 12 virginiaclass submarines as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings equally with our teaming partner the current navy plan calls for construction of one submarine in 2010 and two per year beginning in 2011 

navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog these include the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and zumwaltclass ddg1000 destroyer programs the group’s backlog at the end of 2009 included 12 billion for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first ddg1000 in 2009 the group received approximately 300 in orders under the ddg1000 program 

  

general dynamics 2009 annual report 27 

including approximately 160 for class common equipment cce material to begin construction of the first ship at year end the backlog included approximately 365 for the remaining three ddg51 destroyers under contract we anticipate receiving funding for longlead materials for an additional ddg51 in 2010 the group is currently negotiating contracts with the navy for the construction of two additional ddg1000s we expect these awards to provide stability to the group’s destroyer production for the foreseeable future 

the marine systems group’s backlog at year end also included 880 for four of the remaining six ships under the navy’s take combatlogistics ship program including 200 of longlead materials for the last two ships these two ships have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and we expect to receive construction contracts in 2010 the yearend backlog included 390 for the navy’s littoral combat ship lcs program in 2009 the group delivered its first lcs and received an order worth approximately 410 from the navy for the second ship scheduled for delivery in 2012 

at the end of 2009 the group’s backlog included approximately 125 for the remaining effort on the group’s product carrier contract 

in addition the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 32 billion for engineering repair overhaul and other services in january 2010 the navy awarded the group an additional 120 to continue a development contract for concept studies engineering and design of a common missile compartment for the nextgeneration ballistic missile submarines under development for the navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom 

2010 outlook 

we expect 7 to 8 percent revenue growth in marine systems in 2010 as activity continues to ramp up on the virginiaclass and ddg1000 construction programs as well as submarine engineering activities the group’s operating margins should moderate somewhat to the mid9 percent range due to a shift in contract mix from more mature programs to earlierstage construction particularly among the group’s destroyer programs 

information systems and technology 

review of 2009 vs 2008 

 

 the information systems and technology group’s revenues reached the highest level in the group’s history in 2009 with revenue growth generated in each of the group’s market segments the group’s organic revenue growth was over 4 percent in 2009 with the remainder of the growth provided by acquisitions in the group’s information technology it services and intelligence mission systems businesses the overall increase in revenues in 2009 was welldistributed across the group’s businesses 

 

 in the group’s it services business approximately 20 percent of the revenue growth in 2009 was organic and resulted primarily from higher volume on several it infrastructure and support programs including the new campus east nce contract for the national geospatial intelligence agency the networkcentric solutions netcents program for us federal agencies and the technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support tomis contract for the us bureau of citizenship and immigration the revenue growth on these programs was partially offset by lower activity in the commercial wireless market 

the most notable performance drivers in the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business were higher volume on the warfighter information network – tactical wint program and groundbased satellite communications programs as well as increased sales of encryption products volume in the group’s united kingdombased tactical communications operations was steady compared with 2008 

the intelligence systems business had the highest revenue growth rate in 2009 the result of organic growth in each of its business areas and the acquisition of axsys technologies inc in september 2009 approximately 60 percent of the revenue growth in this business was organic higher activity on cyber security and several classified programs as well as increased volume on a contract to build the spacecraft for nasa’s landsat data continuity mission contributed the majority of this growth 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings increased in line with revenues in 2009 as a result the group achieved operating margins of 107 percent consistent with 2008 margins increased in the tactical systems and intelligence systems businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix but margins were down in the it services business as a result of contract mix 

review of 2008 vs 2007 

 

 revenues in the information systems and technology group increased in 2008 with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business this growth 

  

28 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

resulted from increased activity on several key us military programs such as the wint program and the common hardwaresoftware iii chs3 program as well as higher volume on the group’s groundbased satellite communications programs revenues were up in the group’s core it services business due primarily to the rampup of activity on several new programs including the tomis contract and the warfighter field operations customer support focus army training contract within the it services business the group’s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market revenues in the group’s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007 revenues decreased in the group’s uk business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the bowman communications program for the uk armed forces offset in part by higher activity on other command control communications computing and intelligence systems c4i programs 

operating margins remained steady compared with 2007 as improved performance on the group’s tactical communications programs offset an increased proportion of lowermargin service work in the group’s portfolio 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the information systems and technology group generated a booktobill ratio orders divided by revenues greater than onetoone in 2009 for the second consecutive year as a result the group’s backlog edged up slightly to 103 billion at year end after reporting recordlevel revenues in 2009 the group’s funded backlog grew 16 percent over yearend 2008 to 84 billion at the end of 2009 unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards and relatively few largescale longterm programs some of the more significant programs are highlighted below 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2009 included approximately 860 for the army’s wint program information systems and technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast secure mobile commandandcontrol capabilities in 2009 the group received almost 500 of awards for wint bringing the total program value to 21 billion 

approximately 670 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp under the mhp program the group is scheduled to provide integrated mission systems training and support for 28 stateoftheart helicopters that are intended to replace canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters 

the group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 400 for maintenance and longterm support activities for the united kingdom’s bowman communications program bowman is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces in 2009 the group received almost 500 in orders under this program including an award to upgrade the system’s capabilities and provide longterm technical support 

the intelligence information commandandcontrol equipment and enhancements ice2 program comprised over 325 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2009 ice2 supports critical intelligence and commandandcontrol systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide 

approximately 215 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the warfighter focus program the group provides support for the army’s live virtual and constructive training operations under this contract 

in addition to these programs the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2009 including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

general dynamics 2009 annual report 29 

the group’s backlog does not include approximately 128 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options the value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 12 years in 2009 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 36 billion more than onethird of the group’s orders to the group’s backlog most notably from wint chs3 netcents and warfighter focus 

information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2009 including the following 

 

  

  

  

 shortly after the end of the year the group received two significant contracts from the army – one for training support services and one for healthcare it services the first is an idiq contract to provide technical management and engineering support services for constructive training systems it has a maximum potential value of approximately 390 the second is a contract to provide support for the army’s medical communications for combat casualty care the contract is worth more than 150 if all options are exercised 

2010 outlook 

we expect revenues in the information systems and technology group to grow by 8 to 9 percent in 2010 we expect each of the group’s businesses to contribute to the growth particularly in the areas of it support for intelligence and federal civilian customers and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance work including cyber security the group’s operating margins should decline slightly but remain in the mid10 percent range based on the projected contract mix in 2010 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the results from our commercial pension plans corporate operating expenses totaled 87 in 2009 75 in 2008 and 61 in 2007 the increases in corporate operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense see note o to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock options we expect 2010 corporate operating expenses of approximately 95

we generated cash from operating activities of 29 billion in 2009 31 billion in 2008 and 3 billion in 2007 in all three years the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits particularly in the aerospace group in 2009 cash from operating activities also reflected the collection of approximately 150 from the czech republic after we signed a renegotiated contract to provide pandur ii wheeled vehicles in 2007 the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately 270 of contract funds upon resolution of the marine systems group’s request for equitable adjustment on the take contract 

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to our expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories we along with the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 15 billion at december 31 2009 if this were the outcome we would owe half of the total or approximately 14 billion pretax our aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 715 we believe we have sufficient resources including access to capital markets to pay such an obligation if required 

investing activities 

we used 14 billion in 2009 37 billion in 2008 and 875 in 2007 for investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures 

business acquisitions in 2009 we completed two acquisitions for 811 in 2008 we completed five acquisitions for a total of 32 billion in 2007 we completed four acquisitions for a total of 330 we financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions 

capital expenditures capital expenditures were 385 in 2009 490 in 2008 and 474 in 2007 the decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the aerospace and marine systems groups we expect capital expenditures of approximately 450 in 2010 less than 2 percent of revenues we had no material commitments for capital expenditures on december 31 2009 

marketable securities as a result of lower market interest rates we have expanded our investments in availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities in recent years to generate additional return net purchases of these securities were 235 in 2009 compared with net sales of 17 in 2008 and net purchases of 179 in 2007 

financing activities 

we used 806 in 2009 718 in 2008 and 786 in 2007 for financing activities our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 

debt proceeds net we had no material debt issuances or repayments in 2007 in 2008 we issued 904 of commercial paper primarily to fund acquisitions during the year during that year we also repaid 500 of fixedrate notes 150 of senior notes and 20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates we issued 1 billion of fiveyear fixedrate notes in december 2008 and another 750 of twoyear fixedrate notes in june 2009 we used the proceeds from the fixedrate notes for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements capital expenditures and to term out our commercial paper borrowings we ended 2009 with no commercial paper outstanding and our total debt balance was down by 160 from 2008 we have approximately 18 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program the next material repayment of longterm debt is 700 of fixedrate notes scheduled in the third quarter of 2010 see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations including scheduled debt maturities 

dividends our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 038 per share on march 4 2009 the 12th consecutive annual increase the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to 035 per share in march 2008 and 029 per share in march 2007 

share repurchases in 2009 we repurchased 36 million of our outstanding shares on the open market we repurchased 20 million shares in 2008 and 65 million shares in 2007 on the open market on december 31 2009 approximately 94 million shares remained authorized for repurchase by our board of directors – about 2 percent of our total shares outstanding

nongaap management metrics 

return on invested capital we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns in 2009 for the 11th consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment our return on invested capital roic has grown 290 basis points since 2005 

we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic in 2008 and 2009 was impacted by the reduction and increase respectively in our shareholders’ equity associated with the returns on our retirement plan assets see note p to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our retirement plans roic for 2005 through 2009 is calculated as follows 

 

 free cash flow our free cash flow from operations was 25 billion in 2009 26 billion in 2008 25 billion in 2007 and 18 billion in each of 2006 and 2005 we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

 over the past five years we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period – an average 110 percent conversion rate we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy

offbalance sheet arrangements 

on december 31 2009 other than operating leases we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheet or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or engage with us in leasing hedging or research and development services

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december 31 2009 

 

  

    

  

 application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition we account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we use such output measures otherwise we use input measures 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered 

  

general dynamics 2009 annual report 33 

to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 

we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses on government contracts 

we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our longterm contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned while we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years most contractors use the cumulative catchup method 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on our best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 

goodwill since 1995 we have acquired 54 businesses at a total cost of approximately 21 billion including two in 2009 in connection with these acquisitions we have recognized 123 billion of goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 

the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units these estimates require the use of judgment we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “topdown” analyses including a market assessment of our enterprise value beyond the annual impairment test we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future the fair value of each of our reporting units on december 31 2009 substantially exceeded its carrying value 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

  deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under 

  

34 general dynamics 2009 annual report 

our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and postretirement benefit plans see note p to the consolidated financial statements 

as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses accordingly the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 

we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

new accounting standards 

in december 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 200917 consolidations topic 810 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu 200917 provides additional guidance with respect to the requirements for consolidation of a variable interest entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting rights the standard also requires new disclosures regarding variable interest entities asu 200917 is effective in the first quarter of 2010 we do not expect the adoption of asu 200917 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 fair value measurements and disclosures topic 820 improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 201006 requires new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosures regarding fair value measurements asu 201006 is effective in the first quarter of 2010 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of these risks the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we had 18 billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on december 31 2009 and 24 billion on december 31 2008 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses 

 

 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar euroswiss franc and us dollarswiss franc exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk 

our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations and variablerate commercial paper on december 31 2009 we had 39 billion par value of fixedrate debt we had no commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

investment risk 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of one year on december 31 2009 we held 26 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes our marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of aa given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 57 days on december 31 2009 a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings historically we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values

formed in 1952 through the combination of electric boat company consolidated vultee convair and other companies general dynamics grew internally and through acquisitions until the early 1990s when we sold nearly all of our divisions except electric boat and land systems beginning in 1995 we expanded those two core defense businesses by acquiring additional shipyards and combat vehiclerelated businesses in 1997 to reach a new expanding market we began acquiring companies with expertise in information technology products and services in 1999 we purchased gulfstream aerospace corporation a businessjet aircraft and aviation supportservices company since 1995 we have acquired and successfully integrated 52 businesses including five in 2008 

general dynamics operates through four business groups –aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology 

aerospace 

our aerospace group designs manufactures and outfits a comprehensive family of midsize and largecabin gulfstream businessjet aircraft and provides maintenance refurbishment outfitting and aircraft services for a variety of businessjet widebody and narrowbody aircraft customers globally with 50 years of experience at the forefront of the businessjet aviation market the aerospace group is noted for 

 

  

  

 the group’s gulfstream product portfolio includes eight aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options the varying ranges speeds and cabin dimensions are wellsuited to the transportation needs of an increasingly diverse global customer base the largecabin models are assembled at gulfstream’s headquarters in savannah georgia and outfitted at one of gulfstream’s four us completion facilities a key supplier in israel is responsible for construction of the midsize models gulfstream then outfits these models in the group’s texas completion center 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 3 

for the past several years the aerospace group has experienced a steady increase in demand for its business jets around the world particularly in europe the middle east india and the asiapacific region as a result of this global demand international customers now comprise over 50 percent of the group’s order backlog the group’s customer base is also shifting toward private companies and individual customers which collectively comprise twothirds of total orders the group remains a leading provider of aircraft for government and military service around the world with gulfstream aircraft operating in 34 nations these government aircraft are used for headofstateexecutive transportation and a variety of specialmission applications including aerial reconnaissance maritime surveillance weather research and astronaut training 

to respond to worldwide demand management has adjusted aircraft production rates invested in innovative product development and facility improvements and enhanced the group’s global service network measured increases in aircraft production in recent years have consciously lagged demand which has helped to protect the group’s product pricing while generating a multiyear backlog to ensure that production increases maintain profitability the group’s management has worked closely with its suppliers and invested in manufacturing productivity and efficiency improvements 

the aerospace group continuously invests in research and development rd over the course of each aircraft’s lifecycle to introduce new products and firsttomarket enhancements that broaden customer choice improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety comfort and inflight productivity the two aircraft that joined the gulfstream family in 2008 the supermidsize g250 and the ultralargecabin g650 demonstrate this innovation the g250 offers the largest cabin and the longest range at the fastest speed in its class the g650 is a completely new platform that has the longest range fastest speed largest cabin and mostadvanced cockpit in the gulfstream fleet scheduled to enter service in late 2011 and 2012 respectively these aircraft were created with significant customer input and have been wellreceived gulfstream’s new and upgraded aircraft models are designed to minimize lifecycle costs while maximizing the commonality of parts and pilottype ratings among the various models for multipleaircraft fleet operators this uniformity reduces training and maintenance costs and enhances safety in the operation of the aircraft 

current productenhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics composites flightcontrol systems acoustics cabin technologies and enhanced vision systems in 2007 and early 2008 the federal aviation administration faa and european aviation safety agency certified two of the group’s safetyenhancing products – the secondgeneration enhanced vision system evs ii and the new synthetic visionprimary flight display svpfd both of which assist the pilot during lowvisibility conditions evs ii is a specially designed forwardlooking infrared flir camera that projects a realworld infrared image on the pilot’s headup display hud while synthetic vision provides threedimensional images of the terrain runway environment and obstacles on the pilot’s primary headdown display the products work in tandem to provide pilots with unparalleled situational awareness regardless of weather terrain or landingfield conditions the group also continues to introduce new services to reduce pilot workload streamline maintenance processes and enhance aircraft safety and reliability including planebook and planeconnect planebook is a compact computer tablet preloaded with a complete reference library that includes the airplane flight manual operating manual and pilot checklists improving manualtomanual navigation and reducing paper and weight in the flight deck planeconnect automatically relays any airborne technical issues identified by the plane’s maintenance system to ground technicians reducing turnaround time through early dispatch of parts and technicians 

in march 2006 we embarked on a 400 facilities project designed to create additional rd offices improve the customer sales and design center increase aircraftservice capacity and create facilities to build nextgeneration aircraft in savannah this multiyear project is substantially complete key 2008 developments include 

 

  

  

 in addition to the increased service capacity in savannah we continue to expand the group’s global service support network to address the needs of the growing international installed fleet in november 2008 we acquired jet aviation an aviation services provider with aircraft service centers in more than 20 locations worldwide the addition of jet aviation enables the aerospace group to uphold its commitment to provide customers worldwide firstinclass service and support 24 hours a day 

the acquisition also expands the aerospace group’s portfolio to include premium aircraftoutfitting operations for airframes produced by other original equipment manufacturers oems jet aviation performs aircraft completions and refurbishments for business jets and narrow and widebody commercial aircraft at locations in europe and the united states as a trusted provider of turnkey aircraft management and fixedbase operations fbo services to a broad global customer base jet aviation supports the continued growth and diversification of the aerospace portfolio

a market leader in the businessaviation industry the aerospace group remains focused on 

 

  

  

 net sales for the aerospace group were 19 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2008 18 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2006 net sales by major products and services were as follows 

 

 combat systems 

our combat systems group is a global leader in the design development production support and enhancement of tracked and wheeled military vehicles weapons systems and munitions for the united states and its allies the group’s product lines include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 combat systems has a strong foundation of products that are core platforms for customers across the combat vehicle armaments and munitions product lines these longterm production programs have large durable backlogs providing the group’s management the opportunity to pursue continuous process and productivity improvements to increase customer satisfaction reduce product lifecycle costs and improve the group’s financial performance at the same time the group applies its design and engineering expertise to develop product improvements that advance the utility and performance of these systems while identifying and positioning itself for opportunities in emerging and adjacent markets 

combat systems’ core military vehicle platforms consist of a variety of wheeled combat vehicles and main battle tanks at the heart of these programs are the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and the abrams main battle tank the group is the sole provider of these vehicles – two of the key groundforce assets for its primary customer the us army both of these vehicles have proven highly effective in operations in iraq securing their place in the army’s force structure for the foreseeable future and creating new opportunities for these vehicles in international markets 

combat systems produces strykers under a contract awarded in 2001 which has been modified to support the army’s vision for expanded deployment of the vehicle in new roles throughout the force the stryker supports numerous missions with 10 variants infantry carrier command and control medical evacuation fire support engineering antitank mortar carrier reconnaissance mobile gun system mgs and nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicle nbcrv 

combat systems continues to support the army’s evolving needs for the most capable main battle tank with technological upgrades to the abrams including the system enhancement package sep and the tank urban survivability kit tusk the sepconfigured tank is a digital platform with an enhanced commandandcontrol system secondgeneration thermal sights and improved armor the tusk increases the tank’s utility and crew survivability in urban warfare environments in addition through an innovative partnership with the anniston army depot the group’s abrams integrated management aim program refurbishes the oldest m1a1 abrams tanks to a likenew condition 

complementing these combatvehicle programs are combat systems’ weaponssystem and munitions programs the group manufactures the m2 heavy machine gun and the mk19 and mk47 grenade launchers as well as weapons for most us fighter aircraft including all highspeed gatling guns for fixedwing aircraft and the hydra70 family of rockets the group also holds leading or solesource munitions supply positions for products such as 

 

  

  

  

 in addition combat systems is the principal second source for the us military’s small caliber ammunition needs

as threats to deployed forces have evolved combat systems has established teaming relationships and leveraged its available capacity and vehicleintegration expertise to provide innovative new solutions to customers the group is participating in the defense department’s mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle program which emerged in late 2007 combat systems provides two offerings under this program – the cougar which it produces with a jointventure partner and the rg31 between these two solutions the group and its partner have delivered more than 3600 of the nearly 16000 vehicles purchased under the mrap program the group is scheduled to deliver its remaining 700 vehicles under contract in the first quarter of 2009 while the defense department has completed purchasing vehicles under the initial mrap program it has expressed interest in a similar fastresponse procurement of a lighter version of the mrap for use offroad the group is one of the bidders in this mrap allterrain vehicle mrapatv program 

the past six years of warfare have had a significant impact on us military assets requiring the refurbishment of battledamaged vehicles the replacement of equipment that has reached the end of its service life and the replenishment of ammunition and other supplies for the us armed forces as the principal contractor for the maintenance repair and reset of abrams tanks and stryker vehicles and a major us munitions supplier we expect the sustaining and upgrading of us forces to become an increasing share of combat systems’ contract mix 

the combat systems group is also focused on innovative technologies and is wellpositioned to participate in future development programs for the us marine corps the group continues the design and testing of the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv an expeditionary combat platform designed to replace the service’s current craft the efv has a breakthrough design that provides sea maneuverability at speeds up to 25 knots and ground mobility equaling that of the abrams tank the group is building seven new prototypes as part of a system design and development contract and we expect the marine corps to authorize production of up to 573 vehicles starting in 2012 

combat systems is a key team member in the army’s future combat systems fcs program and leads the system development of the fcs manned ground vehicle which will complement the army’s existing combat brigades composed of strykers and abrams tanks the group is also a member of one of three teams awarded technology demonstration contracts for the joint light tactical vehicle jltv which is intended to replace the army’s fleet of high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwv or humvees ®  

combat systems also has a significant presence internationally and is a recognized militaryvehicle integrator and leading defensemateriel provider worldwide it has manufacturing facilities in australia austria canada france germany spain and switzerland and has customers in more than 30 countries the group’s european business offers a broad range of products including light and mediumweight tracked and wheeled tactical vehicles amphibious bridge systems artillery systems light weapons ammunition and propellants like the group’s us products many of these systems constitute key platforms employed by its customers’ military forces these include the leopard 2e tank and the pizarro tracked infantry combat vehicle produced for the spanish army the pandur ii armored combat vehicle produced for the portuguese army and navy and the piranha wheeled armored vehicle which the group has sold to several european countries 

beyond the european market combat systems is experiencing increased international demand as a result of the demonstrated success of its fielded products in particular the group has opportunities to provide abrams tanks to egypt strykers light armored vehicles and abrams tanks to iraq and light armored vehicles and abrams tank upgrades to saudi arabia 

to expand and diversify the products combat systems provides to customers around the world and to pursue new markets we acquired axletech international axletech of troy michigan in december 2008 axletech is a global manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered axles suspensions brakes and aftermarket parts for heavypayload vehicles for a variety of military and commercial customers 

the combat systems group continues to focus on operational execution across the business as it delivers on its substantial backlog in an environment of continuously expanding threats and evolving customer needs including an increased emphasis on speed to market the group remains focused on its customers’ requirements and the opportunities they present

 the substantial majority of marine systems’ workload supports the us navy these efforts include the construction of new ships and the design and development of nextgeneration platforms to help the customer face evolving missions and maintain its desired fleet size as well as maintenance and repair services to maximize the life and effectiveness of inservice ships this business consists of major shipconstruction programs awarded under large multiship contracts that span several years the group’s mature navy construction programs currently consist of the fastattack virginiaclass nuclearpowered submarine the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyer and the lewis and clarkclass take dry cargoammunition combatlogistics ship 

the virginiaclass submarine is the first us submarine designed to address postcold war threats including capabilities tailored for both openocean and nearshore missions these stealthy ships are wellsuited for a variety of global assignments including clandestine intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch 

the navy’s virginiaclass program of record includes 30 submarines which the customer is procuring in multiship blocks the group in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction of these vessels has delivered the four ships under its costreimbursable block i contract and the first ship under its fixedprice block ii contract work is in progress on the remaining five ships under that contract and deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2013 the navy awarded the group an eightship block iii contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 extending deliveries through 2018 as a result of strong navy and congressional support innovative costsaving design and production efforts and successful program execution the group is scheduled to build two submarines per year starting in 2011 which will double the group’s current submarine workload 

marine systems is the lead designer and producer of arleigh burke destroyers a sophisticated class of surface combatants and the only active destroyer in the navy’s global surface fleet during 2008 the group delivered uss sterett and uss stockdale the 29th and 30th of 34 ddg51 ships the navy has contracted with the group to build the four remaining ships are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2011 the navy and the congress are currently evaluating future ddg51 production requirements 

the group’s take is the navy’s first new combatlogistics ship design in almost 20 years and the first navy ship to incorporate proven commercial marine technologies such as integrated electricdrive propulsion these technologies are designed to minimize take operations and maintenance costs over an expected 40year life the take ships support multiple missions for the navy including replenishment at sea for us and nato operating forces around the world the group has delivered the first six of these ships including two in 2008 work is underway on four of the remaining six ships currently under contract with deliveries scheduled through 2012 the navy has funded longlead material procurement for the final two ships under the contract which if fully exercised would bring the program total to 14 ships 

the marine systems group is also participating in the development of technologies and naval platforms for the future following the conversion of four trident ballisticmissile submarines ssbns to guidedmissile submarines ssgns to address tacticalstrike and specialoperations mission requirements the group continues to apply its design and engineering expertise to advance nextgeneration submarine capabilities for example marine systems leads a joint navydefense advanced research projects agency darpa initiative to identify and overcome technological barriers to reducing the cost of future submarines under this initiative the group is developing technologies to propel submarines with external electric motors reduce the ship’s infrastructure and improve its sensors the group’s efforts also include initial concept studies for the development of the nextgeneration ballistic missile submarine 

marine systems is also participating in a number of programs in support of the navy’s efforts to renew its surface combatant fleet the group is focused on completing the design and starting construction of the nextgeneration guidedmissile destroyer the ddg1000 zumwalt class the group has one of two contracts for the construction of a ddg1000 destroyer the congress has partially funded a third ship in the 2009 defense appropriations bill and with the navy is evaluating future ddg1000 production requirements 

marine systems leads one of two industry teams awarded contracts for the design and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs a new highspeed surface warship designed to address emerging coastalwater threats marine systems’ lcs is wellsuited to accommodate the speed draft and cargo capacity requirements of this new combatant class of warship the group launched its first ship in the fourth quarter of 2008 and expects to deliver the ship in mid2009 the navy is currently assessing future lcs construction requirements

customers 

in 2008 69 percent of our net sales were to the us government 14 percent were to us commercial customers 9 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 8 percent were to international commercial customers 

us government 

our primary customers are the us department of defense and intelligence community we have expanded our relationships with other us government customers including the department of homeland security and several firstresponder agencies at federal and state levels our net sales to the us government were as follows 

 

  we perform our us government business under costreimbursement timeandmaterials and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses us for allowable costs and pays a fixed fee andor an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses us for materials costs our production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount 

costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 38 percent of our us government business in 2008 and 40 percent in 2007 timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent in 2008 and 2007 and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 55 percent in 2008 and 53 percent in 2007 

  

10 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk they also can include fee schedules that allow the customer to make additional payments when we satisfy certain performance criteria however not all costs are reimbursed under these types of contracts and the government can challenge the costs we charge in addition the negotiated base fees are generally lower consistent with our lower risk under timeandmaterials contracts our targeted profit may vary if actual labor hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates additionally because we generally charge materials costs with little or no fee the content mix can impact the profit margins associated with these contracts fixedprice contracts typically have higher fee levels in recognition of the higher risk and offer us additional profits if we can complete the work for less than the contract amount however fixedprice contracts require that we absorb cost overruns 

us commercial 

our us commercial sales were 4057 in 2008 3732 in 2007 and 3831 in 2006 these sales represented approximately 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in each of 2008 and 2007 and 16 percent in 2006 the majority of these sales are for gulfstream aircraft this customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies representing a wide range of industries 

international 

our direct sales to government and commercial customers outside the united states were 5097 in 2008 4751 in 2007 and 3828 in 2006 these sales represented approximately 17 percent of our consolidated net sales in each of 2008 and 2007 and 16 percent in 2006 

we conduct business around the world with subsidiary operations in australia austria canada france germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom our nonus subsidiaries are committed to developing longterm relationships in their respective countries and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers 

our international commercial business consists primarily of businessjet aircraft exports and the delivery of aircraft support from a worldwide service network the market for businessjet aircraft and related services outside north america has expanded rapidly in recent years particularly in europe the middle east india and the asiapacific region while the united states continues to be our largest market for business aircraft orders from customers outside north america represent a growing segment of our aircraft business exceeding 50 percent of total orders and total backlog in 2008

competition 

several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in both the defense and businessjet aircraft markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary the principal competitive elements include 

 

  

  

  

 defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for defense products and services we compete against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers operating in the local countries our combat systems group competes with a 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 11 

large number of domestic and foreign businesses our marine systems group has only one primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also partners or subcontracts on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine and ddg1000 zumwaltclass destroyer our information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the defense market’s contractbased procurement environment and the longterm operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully 

at times we are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements in these situations we may have multiple opportunities to participate these include roles as the program’s system integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants in the team or as a provider of a specific hardware or subsystem element such as military vehicles provided by combat systems or core mission systems provided by information systems and technology 

another competitive factor in the defense market is the us government’s increasing use of multipleaward idiq contracts to provide customers with flexible procurement options idiq contracts allow the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a program and establish an overall spending limit when the government awards idiq contracts to multiple bidders under the same program we must compete to be selected as a participant in the program and subsequently compete for individual delivery orders this contracting model is most common in our information systems and technology group’s competitions but has been increasingly used in programs for which our combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft manufacturing market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has at least one competitor for each of its products currently in production with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft there are currently no competitors in the group’s ultralargecabin market g650 key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance comfort and inflight productivity service quality and timeliness technological and newproduct innovation and price we believe gulfstream competes effectively in all these areas 

jet aviation competes in its businessjet aircraft services business primarily on price and service quality and timeliness in its completions business jet aviation competes with other original equipment manufacturers that also complete their own aircraft as well as other thirdparty providers in its maintenance repair and overhaul business and fbo business jet aviation competes worldwide with several other large companies as well as a large number of smaller companies particularly in the maintenance business 

research and development 

we conduct independent rd activities as part of our normal business operations over the past three years the majority of our companysponsored rd expenditures was in the defense business in accordance with government regulations we recover a significant portion of these expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts in the commercial sector most of our aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs we also conduct customersponsored rd activities under us government contracts 

research and development expenditures were as follows 

 

 employees 

on december 31 2008 we had approximately 92300 employees 24 percent of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor representatives agreements covering approximately 3 percent of total employees are due to expire during 2009 historically we have renegotiated labor agreements without any significant disruption of operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on pricing effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance we attempt to mitigate these risks by entering longterm agreements with our suppliers or negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts we have not experienced and do not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for our business operations 

our business is not seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of our revenue recognition in the united states these factors are influenced by the federal government’s octobertoseptember fiscal year this process has historically resulted in higher revenues in the latter half of the year internationally many of our government customers schedule deliveries toward the end of the calendar year resulting in increasing revenues and earnings over the course of the year 

  

12 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

backlog 

our total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows 

 

  

intellectual property 

we are a leader in the development of innovative products manufacturing technologies and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property we license some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by our patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in our opinion have a material impact on our business 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far and the cost accounting standards cas govern the majority of our contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of our costs while the cas address how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far also subjects us to audits and other government reviews these reviews cover issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts the government may use information from these reviews to challenge our contractrelated costs and fees failure to comply with procurement laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or administrative proceedings these might involve fines penalties suspension of payments or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

international 

our international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as certain us policies and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa we are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control including the international traffic in arms regulations itar other factors that can affect international sales include currency exchange fluctuations and political and economic risks 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aircraft completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type for safety reasons if they believe the aircraft does not meet their standards maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 13 

environmental 

we are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of some materials substances and wastes we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at thirdparty sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency as a prp we potentially are liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where we have been designated a prp generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other prps we regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of our operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are allowable and recoverable under our contracts with the us government based on information currently available and current us government policies relating to allowable costs we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls see note o to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

available information

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding whether to purchase our securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are however some risks that apply more specifically to general dynamics based on our type of business of course these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that we or any company face additional risks and uncertainties currently considered immaterial could also affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because three of our four business groups serve the defense market our sales are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition our expansion of sales to international customers in recent years exposes us to different financial and legal risks in our aerospace group’s market we face risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of our us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each group shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

we depend on the us government for a significant portion of our sales in each of the past three years over twothirds of our sales were to the us government us defense spending historically has been cyclical though it is not clear that future defense spending will be equally cyclical defense budgets rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety at other times spending on the military can decrease while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years there is no assurance this trend will continue competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of spending which could impact the defense budget 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in our existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow future sales and earnings 

  

14 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination our us government sales are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract second future sales under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor generally is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays for only the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future sales and earnings 

our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft our aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products and services by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and individual customers the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets toward the end of 2008 wellknown shocks to the financial and credit markets resulted in a slowdown in aircraft order flow and led to several defaults by our customers under contracts to purchase new aircraft continued malaise in the general economy and in particular the financial services sector could result in additional defaults if our aerospace group is unable to replace contracts terminated due to future customer defaults with existing contracts in the backlog or new contracts the group’s anticipated sales and profitability could be reduced as a result 

our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts when agreeing to contractual terms our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess 

 

  

  

  

  

 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if we face unexpected contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected this could affect our earnings and margins 

our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing we rely on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for our products subcontractors perform some of the services that we provide to our customers we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements occasionally we rely on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes government customers in newly formed freemarket economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature which can complicate the contracting process in this context our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s leadership national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our sales and earnings associated with our international business 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 15 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers virtually all of the products that we produce and sell are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and systemintegration techniques and capabilities the commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of our business we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 

developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance while we maintain insurance for some business risks it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities where permitted by applicable laws we seek indemnification from the us government in addition we generally seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 we may elect to provide products or services even in instances where we are unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification

management overview 

general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions shipbuilding design and construction and information systems technologies and services we operate through four business groups – aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology our primary customers are the us military other us government organizations the armed forces of other nations and a diverse base of corporate government and individual buyers of business aircraft we operate in two primary markets defense and business aviation the majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the us military 

the nation’s engagement in the global war on terror coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven steady department of defense funding increases since 2001 in particular procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of our revenues defense department total or topline funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 69 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2009 while procurement and rd spending has grown nearly 73 percent annually during that period for fiscal year 2009 the congress appropriated 516 billion for the department of defense including approximately 182 billion for procurement and rd budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years our future growth potential in the us defense market is driven by the size of the defense budget the allocation of that budget to investment accounts the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded 

during this period of war defense budgets have included the president’s budget submission as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter for fiscal year 2008 the congress appropriated 183 billion in emergency spending including approximately 68 billion or 37 percent for investment accounts for fiscal year 2009 the congress has appropriated 66 billion in supplemental funding primarily for battlefield operational requirements the defense department has indicated that it will request at least another 70 billion of supplemental funding in 2009 to include funds for procuring additional weaponry if this second supplemental is approved defense funding for fiscal year 2009 will total approximately 652 billion a 110 percent increase since 2001 

looking ahead we expect defense core budget topline growth to moderate in the nearterm topline funding should remain at or near current wellfunded levels led by the need to continue to support ongoing war operations while the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with the new administration’s defense strategy as well as dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions we expect nearterm defense funding levels to be driven primarily by the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 future supplemental funding levels will likely decrease in tandem with the administration’s current plan to reduce troop levels in 

iraq offset somewhat by an increased footprint in afghanistan as this supplemental spending decreases some of the supplemental funding that had previously been used to finance core procurement programs will likely shift back to the base budget 

beyond our us defense market governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to significant defense export opportunities we are committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies while the revenue upside can be significant european and other international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world we expect growing international sales 

the businessaviation market remained strong for much of 2008 while midsize order activity moderated from past years gulfstream enjoyed continued strong order activity for its longrange and ultralongrange businessjet offerings including its new g650 product market conditions changed significantly however in the fourth quarter of 2008 as credit and financial markets seized in reaction to deteriorating global economic conditions this severe dislocation caused new aircraft order activity to slow 

this sudden financial turmoil affected some of gulfstream’s customers who either sought deferral or defaulted on their aircraft orders 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 19 

these perturbations in the group’s backlog had no impact to financial performance in 2008 due largely to the willingness of customers in the backlog to move up to earlier availabilities if the market continues to erode additional defaults and deferrals may occur however we believe the diversity and duration of the businessjet order book positions the aerospace group to bridge the current market turmoil aircraftservice revenues which grew 8 percent in 2008 provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by recent growth in the global installed businessjet fleet we believe continued investment in new aircraft products will drive longterm growth particularly when the aerospace group begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings the g250 in 2011 and the g650 in 2012 

we are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow general dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided our management the flexibility to execute our operational strategy and enabled us to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

consolidated overview 

the following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level the disclosures focus on the material financial measures our management uses to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups including sales operating earnings and margins cash flow and orders and backlog for the defense business groups the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers for the aerospace group the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed 

in the defense business groups the majority of the sales are generated by longterm government contracts as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section we account for sales under these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable as a result changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 

in the aerospace group we recognize revenue using the percentageofcompletion method sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft revenues in the aerospace group’s jet aviation aircraft outfitting business are recognized as work progresses similar to our defense businesses aircraft services revenues are recognized upon delivery of services changes in sales in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities the level of service activity during the period and the number of preowned aircraft sold 

operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume performance or the mix of contracts eg fixedpricecostreimbursable and the phases of work within those contracts eg developmentproduction performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract andor the estimated costs required to complete the contract the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 

operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are generally a function of the prices we are able to charge for our various aircraft models the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midsize aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed the number and type of preowned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group which include selling expenses and research and development costs

results of operations 

 

 in 2008 we achieved solid growth in sales and a significant increase in operating earnings compared with 2007 this strong performance during the year resulted in our highest operating margin in eight years backed by continued strong cash flows from operations we received a record level of orders in 2008 ending the year with the highest backlog in our history 

each of our four business groups produced increases in sales in 2008 over the prior year sales growth in the aerospace and marine systems groups was particularly strong in 2008 as a result of continued increases in businessjet aircraft deliveries and increased activity on us navy and commercial shipbuilding programs in the combat systems group strong demand for us military vehicles and related support services drove the increase in sales higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the sales growth in the information systems and technology group 

our operating earnings increased at more than double the rate of sales growth in 2008 and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of 1 billion growth in operating earnings exceeded the sales growth in all of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance overall our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 125 percent in 2008 the fifth consecutive year of margin expansion 

 

 we produced significant sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of our business groups in particular the combat systems and aerospace groups generated substantial sales growth in 2007 on us military vehicle sales and increased businessjet deliveries sales in the information systems and technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of anteon international corporation in mid2006 sales were up slightly in the marine systems group compared with 2006 our operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007 as three of our four business groups achieved significant operating leverage the aerospace group’s earnings and margins reflected the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements operating earnings and margins were up in combat systems and marine systems due to improved operational execution across a variety of programs our overall operating margins improved 50 basis points in 2007 to 114 percent 

cash flow 

cash flows from operations in 2008 exceeded net earnings for the tenth consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities was 31 billion in 2008 29 billion in 2007 and 21 billion in 2006 in addition we generated over 300 in cash in 2006 from the sale of several noncore businesses over the threeyear period we used our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay maturing debt our net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities – was 23 billion at the end of 2008 compared with a net surplus of 268 at the end of 2007 our net debt increased by 25 billion during the year after 32 billion spent on acquisitions over 15 billion of share repurchases 533 of dividends paid 490 of capital expenditures and more than 470 of companysponsored research and development during the year 

other financial information 

general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 59 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 2007 and 62 percent in 2006 reflecting our continued emphasis on operating leverage ga was 17 billion in 2008 16 billion in 2007 and 15 billion in 2006 we expect 2009 ga as a percent of sales to approximate the 2008 rate 

net interest expense was 66 in 2008 compared with 70 in 2007 and 101 in 2006 interest income generated by our strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of our longterm debt have steadily reduced interest expense we expect net interest expense to increase to approximately 140 to 150 in 2009 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008 

our effective tax rate was 312 percent in 2008 317 percent in 2007 and 323 percent in 2006 in 2008 our taxes were reduced by a refund associated with the settlement of outstanding litigation this resulted in a 35 or approximately 009 pershare benefit that reduced our 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service this settlement resulted in a benefit of 18 or approximately 004 per share which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 315 to 32 percent in 2009 for additional discussion of tax matters see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

in 2008 we entered into an agreement to sell our spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of 11 in discontinued operations we expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2009 

in 2007 we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately 25 we had previously recognized a pretax loss of 57 in discontinued operations in 2006 in anticipation of the sale 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 21 

in 2006 we completed the sale of our aggregates operation we received approximately 315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized a pretax gain of 199 in discontinued operations 

our reported net sales exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses we have included their operating results along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above as discontinued operations net of income taxes for additional discussion of our divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations see note c to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog and estimated potential contact value 

our total backlog increased almost 60 percent in 2008 to 741 billion at the end of the year funded backlog was 517 billion at year end up 39 percent over 2007 we received 57 billion of new orders in 2008 the highest level in our history order activity was significant across each of our business groups resulting in backlog growth in each group in 2008 

the total backlog for our defense businesses increased 49 percent in 2008 to 516 billion compared with 346 billion at the end of 2007 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog was 299 billion at the end of 2008 up 17 percent over 2007 this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 

the aerospace group’s total backlog reached a record level of 225 billion at yearend 2008 compared with 123 billion at the end of 2007 an increase of more than 83 percent the group’s funded backlog increased almost 90 percent during the year to 219 billion at the end of 2008 the funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the aerospace unfunded backlog of 618 at the end of 2008 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 

idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements which set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of our idiq value represents contracts for which we have been designated as the solesource supplier to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems the estimated potential contract value also includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multipleaward idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders under the contract because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts if the customer exercises the option these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft including longterm option agreements with fleet customers we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

as of december 31 2008 the estimated potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 168 billion up from 145 billion at the end of 2007 we expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years this represents management’s estimate of the potential value we will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower

results of operations and outlook 

 

   

22 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

the aerospace group generated significant sales growth in 2008 attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007 the group increased aircraft production rates for the fifth consecutive year in 2008 in response to a steadily growing aircraft backlog as a result new aircraft sales increased 12 percent in 2008 sequential years of higher new aircraft deliveries have expanded the group’s worldwide installed base of businessjet aircraft as a result demand in the group’s aircraft services business grew in 2008 with volume up 8 percent compared to 2007 our november 2008 acquisition of jet aviation a businessjet outfitting and aviationservices company also contributed to the group’s sales growth approximately onequarter of the group’s increase in sales in 2008 came from the addition of jet aviation preowned aircraft sales were 18 in 2008 down from 78 in 2007 the group had four preowned aircraft available for sale on december 31 2008 

the aerospace group’s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than sales in 2008 the following factors impacted the group’s growth in operating earnings during the year 

 

 operating earnings and margins on the group’s 2008 aircraft deliveries were up compared with the units delivered in 2007 the result of improved pricing on aircraft orders over the past several years the group also continued to generate productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes which further improved earnings in 2008 in late 2008 the number of preowned aircraft transactions was significantly curtailed in response to the deterioration of the global economic environment as a result the group wrote down the carrying value of the four preowned aircraft available for sale at year end the group’s earnings growth was also tempered by increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher productdevelopment costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008 the net effect of these factors was a 170 basispoint increase in operating margins in 2008 following two years of 120 basispoint improvement 

the significant deterioration in the economic environment in late 2008 weakened the global demand for business jets particularly in the midsize aircraft segment as a consequence of these conditions and the relatively short duration of the group’s midsize backlog we plan to significantly reduce midsize aircraft production in 2009 given the substantial level and duration of the largecabin aircraft backlog we expect to increase production of these models in 2009 however we assess aircraft production requirements quarterly and will modify the group’s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of our backlog and market conditions we also expect more preowned activity in 2009 than we experienced in 2008 or 2007 of the contracts for 2009 aircraft deliveries approximately 10 include aircraft tradein options which the customers may elect to exercise 

including the effect of a full year of results of jet aviation we expect the aerospace group’s 2009 sales to increase between 20 and 25 percent over 2008 we expect the group’s operating margins to be 200 to 220 basis points lower than those achieved in 2008 due primarily to the increase in aircraftservices volume associated with the jet aviation acquisition 

 

 the aerospace group’s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2007 over 2006 to meet growing global demand the group increased aircraft production in 2007 resulting in newaircraft sales growth of 22 percent compared with the prior year aircraftservices volume also increased 20 percent over 2006 sales of preowned aircraft decreased to 78 in 2007 from 217 in 2006 as favorable market conditions led more customers to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them in 

operating earnings in 2007 increased approximately 205 as a result of the higher newaircraft and aircraftservices volume the earnings growth was also driven by improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 as well as labor efficiencies and productivity improvements particularly in the aircraftcompletion process these factors contributed a 65 increase in earnings in 2007 higher selling and ga costs and productdevelopment spending reduced the group’s earnings growth by approximately 90 and lower sales of preowned aircraft reduced the earnings growth by 14 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 23 

the aerospace group’s backlog increased 83 percent in 2008 to 225 billion at year end the largest backlog in the group’s history the group’s funded backlog was 219 billion at year end up 89 percent over 2007 in 2008 the group received 154 billion in new orders a record level for the fifth consecutive year and an increase of 67 percent over 2007 in addition the acquisition of jet aviation in the fourth quarter added approximately 750 to the group’s backlog related to agreements to perform outfitting work for other equipment manufacturers 

in the second quarter of 2008 the group began taking orders for the gulfstream g650 a new ultralongrange ultralargecabin business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2012 in the fourth quarter the group introduced and began taking orders for the gulfstream g250 a new supermidsize business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2011 

the group experienced strong demand in north america as well as a growing proportion of international orders in 2008 over 50 percent of the group’s orders in 2008 were from customers outside north america for the second year in a row the group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries for largecabin models through periods ranging from 2011 to 2017 the backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft including longterm agreements with fleet customers these options totaled 23 billion at the end of 2008 and are included in estimated potential contract value 

as a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions in 2008 the group had some customers default on their contracts late in the fourth quarter these defaults had no impact on the group’s 2008 deliveries we were able to fill those production slots with other customers who were interested in moving forward in the delivery queue despite the defaults the backlog grew in 2008 as the group achieved a booktobill ratio aircraft orders divided by deliveries greater than one for the fifth consecutive year while the backlog continues to have some risk particularly if the economic climate worsens we will continue to work with customers to minimize the future impact to the group’s performance

 the increase in us military vehicle sales was driven primarily by higher activity on the group’s mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle program and several contracts in support of the group’s abrams main battle tank modernization efforts under the mrap program which emerged in late 2007 the group produces rg31 and cougar armored vehicles for the us department of defense the group is scheduled to complete deliveries of its remaining rg31 mrap vehicles under contract in the first quarter of 2009 under the abrams program volume was up most notably in 2008 on the system enhancement package sep upgrade and on contracts to repair and reset battledamaged m1 tanks 

sales in the group’s weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds sales increased slightly on the group’s munitions programs over 2007 particularly on its large and mediumcaliber munitions supply contracts for the united states and canada 

  

24 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

in the group’s european military vehicles business volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs including the leopard tank program with the spanish government the decrease in sales in 2008 on these programs was offset slightly by increased volume on the group’s piranha wheeled armored vehicle contract for belgium and higher activity within the group’s mobile bridge business 

in december 2007 the group received a notice of termination from the czech republic regarding its contract to deliver 199 pandur ii military vehicles in the second quarter of 2008 we entered into a memorandum of understanding and a testing agreement with the czech republic regarding the testing and acceptance of 17 vehicles that had been completed by the group we are negotiating a revised contract for the purchase of 107 vehicles including the 17 completed vehicles we do not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group’s operating results due to ongoing negotiations there were no sales recognized under this contract in 2008 but we expect to continue production upon finalization of the revised contract 

the combat systems group’s operating earnings grew significantly in 2008 increasing at more than four times the rate of sales growth during the year while the most significant driver of the group’s earnings growth was improved performance in the us military vehicle business particularly on the mrap and abrams programs each of the group’s businesses generated at least a 100 basispoint increase in margins in 2008 the operating leverage achieved across combat systems’ operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basispoint improvement in the group’s operating margins compared with 2007 

on december 19 2008 we acquired axletech international axletech of troy michigan axletech is a global manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered axles suspensions brakes and aftermarket parts for heavypayload vehicles for a variety of military and commercial customers 

we expect combat systems to produce sales growth of approximately 20 to 25 percent in 2009 including the addition of axletech’s revenues we expect the group’s operating margins to return to a more sustainable mid12 percent level in 2009 

 

 in 2007 combat systems generated the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings among our four business groups each of the group’s businesses experienced doubledigit sales and earnings growth over 2006 more than half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group’s us military vehicle business including higher activity on abramsrelated contracts and the stryker wheeled combat vehicle program the rampup of production of light armored vehicles lavs for the us marine corps and increased production of mrap military vehicles sales increased almost 50 percent in the group’s munitions business in 2007 due to strong volume in its large and mediumcaliber munitions supply contracts and the acquisition of snc technologies inc in january 2007 in the group’s weapons systems business sales grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on its counteried contract the european military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007 this growth resulted primarily from increased activity on pandur and piranha wheeled vehicle contracts for several european governments 

the group’s operating margins increased 40 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group’s wheeled military vehicle programs the margin growth was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lowermargin acquisitions in the munitions business increased supplier costs on the group’s smallcaliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with our exit from the group’s european commercial trading business 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the combat systems group’s total backlog was 15 billion at the end of 2008 an increase of 16 percent over 2007 funded backlog grew 12 percent in 2008 to 121 billion at year end the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014

marine systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 

net sales in the marine systems group improved in 2008 as a result of increased activity across each of the group’s shipyards the growth in the group’s sales consisted of the following 

 

 approximately 60 percent of the marine systems group’s sales in both 2008 and 2007 were produced by three mature shipproduction programs for the us navy – the virginiaclass submarine the take combatlogistics ship and the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer activity increased on the virginia program in 2008 as the group continued construction on its costreimbursable block i contract and its fixedprice block ii contract the final block i ship and the first block ii ship were delivered in 2008 and construction is in process on the remaining five block ii ships the group received a multiyear eightship block iii award in the fourth quarter of 2008 and as a result the group expects 

  

26 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

to increase production to two ships per year beginning in 2011 including block iii deliveries are scheduled through 2018 on the take program volume increased in 2008 as the group delivered the fifth and sixth ships and continued construction of the seventh through tenth ships of the group’s 14ship program deliveries are scheduled through 2012 activity on the arleigh burke destroyer program decreased slightly in 2008 compared with 2007 the group delivered two destroyers in 2008 and construction is in process on the remaining four ships under contract with deliveries scheduled through 2011 

the group’s product carrier program produced the increase in commercial shipbuilding volume in 2008 construction of the first three ships ramped up in 2008 and the first ship was delivered in early 2009 the next two ships are scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2009 

in addition to the large shipconstruction programs sales increased on the group’s design and earlystage production contracts for the navy most notably volume increased on the group’s ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer program the completion of the group’s ssgn submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008 

the marine systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008 increasing operating earnings at double the rate of sales growth as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the virginia ddg51 take and commercial product carrier programs these improvements generated an overall 100 basispoint increase in the group’s operating margins over 2007 

we expect sales growth in the marine systems group of approximately 5 to 6 percent in 2009 as the group continues to deliver on its record backlog we expect the group’s operating margins to increase slightly with continued operating efficiencies at each of the shipyards 

 

 the marine systems group’s sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006 combined sales from the virginiaclass take and arleigh burke destroyer programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006 activity was up significantly on the take contract but volume on the virginia and arleigh burke programs declined in 2007 volume was up across the group’s ship design engineering repair and overhaul and earlystage construction programs for the navy including the detail design of the ddg1000 and the construction of the first littoral combat ship lcs volume on these two programs increased more than 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 additionally activity was up more than 10 percent on the group’s engineering repair and overhaul contracts for the navy in 2007 particularly in the group’s nuclear submarine support and logistics services business combined sales on the group’s ssgn submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs decreased more than 50 percent during the year as the group completed its fourth and final ssgn submarine conversion in 2007 and its fourship commercial tanker program in 2006 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales the group generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs including the virginiaclass submarine the arleigh burkeclass destroyer and the ssgn submarine conversions additionally we reached an agreement with the navy in 2007 to restructure the take contract the agreement included a resolution of an outstanding request for equitable adjustment rea which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships prior to the agreement we recognized revenue on the take program at a breakeven level pending the resolution of the rea after the contract restructuring the program estimate at completion was revised and we began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts at the end of 2008 the group’s backlog reached an alltime high of 264 billion more than double the 121 billion backlog at the end of 2007 the group’s funded backlog increased 38 percent in 2008 to 105 billion at the end of the year the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years the current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018 

the virginiaclass submarine program is the largest contract in the group’s backlog the group’s backlog at year end included 181 billion for 13 virginiaclass submarines to be delivered through 2018 the group received 145 billion in virginiaclass orders in 2008 including a 138 billion block iii award for the construction of eight submarines the contract included 23 billion of funding for construction of the first ship and longlead materials for the second ship as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program we report the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but share the construction and the earnings equally with our teaming partner the current navy plan calls 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 27 

for construction of one submarine in 2009 and 2010 and two per year from 2011 to 2013 

the marine systems group’s backlog at year end also included 18 billion for the navy’s take combatlogistics ship program in 2008 the group received 16 billion in take orders including the exercise of the options for ships 10 through 12 and longlead materials for the 13th and 14th ships deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2012 

navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group’s backlog these include the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 and zumwaltclass ddg1000 destroyer programs at year end the backlog included approximately 765 for the remaining four ddg51 destroyers under contract deliveries are scheduled through 2011 including two in 2009 in 2008 the group received one of two contracts worth approximately 14 billion for the construction of a ddg1000 destroyer scheduled to be delivered in 2013 the group’s backlog at the end of 2008 included 15 billion for the completion of the design effort and construction of the ddg1000 the navy is currently evaluating future ddg51 and ddg1000 production requirements 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2008 also included 365 for a contract with us shipping partners lp for the remaining work in the construction of five product carriers under a potential nineship program the five ships under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011 the customer has indicated in public filings its reluctance to purchase ships six through nine if the customer fails to exercise its options under the contract we believe ample opportunity exists to remarket these ships 

in addition the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included approximately 35 billion in engineering repair and overhaul programs 

information systems and technology 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the information systems and technology group’s net sales exceeded 10 billion for the first time in 2008 with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business the group’s increase in sales in 2008 was attributable to the following 

 

 the group’s us defense market consists of the tactical and strategic mission systems information technology it and mission services and intelligence mission systems businesses the tactical and strategic mission systems business generated doubledigit sales growth in 2008 this growth resulted from increased activity on several key us military programs such as the warfighter information network – tactical wint program and the common hardwaresoftware iii chs3 program as well as higher volume on the group’s groundbased satellite communications programs the group provides fast secure mobile commandandcontrol capabilities to warfighters under wint and commercial and ruggedized computers network equipment and software to the us armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide under chs3 sales were up in the group’s core it services business due primarily to the rampup of activity on several new programs including the group’s contract to provide technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support tomis services for the us bureau of citizenship and immigration and the warfighter field operations customer support focus contract under the warfighter focus program the group provides support for the army’s live virtual and constructive training operations sales in the group’s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007 

the group’s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market however sales in the commercial wireless business appeared to stabilize in the second half of 2008 

sales decreased in the group’s united kingdom business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the bowman communications program for the uk armed forces offset in part by higher activity on other command control communications computing and intelligence systems c4i programs the bowman program has reached a steadystate level of volume for the foreseeable future as the group continues ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity 

the information systems and technology group’s operating earnings increased at a rate consistent with sales growth as a result the group was able to maintain a 107 percent operating margin equaling 2007 despite an increased proportion of lowermargin service work 

we expect 8 percent sales growth in the information systems and technology group in 2009 with contributions from each of the group’s businesses we expect operating margins to be down 30 to 40 basis points compared with 2008 based on the scheduled contract mix in 2009 

 

 sales in the information systems and technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006 and operating earnings topped 1 billion for the first time the group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core north american tactical and strategic mission systems and it and 

  

28 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

mission services businesses the strong performance in the tactical and strategic mission systems business was due to higher activity on programs such as combat operations centers coc chs3 and mobile user objective system muos as well as increased volume on the group’s groundbased satellite communications programs the it and mission services business benefited from the acquisition of anteon international corporation anteon in june 2006 and higher volume in its core defense market on the strength of such programs as intelligence information commandandcontrol equipment and enhancements ice2 and networkcentric solutions netcents these increases were offset partially by an expected decline in volume on the uk bowman program reduced activity in the group’s intelligence mission systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market the group’s operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group’s shift to include more it services content including the acquisition of anteon 

backlog and estimated potential contract value 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog grew 7 percent in 2008 to 102 billion at year end reflecting a booktobill ratio in dollars of 112 for the year the group’s funded backlog on december 31 increased slightly compared with 2007 to 72 billion representing approximately 70 percent of the group’s total backlog unlike our other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards and relatively few largescale longterm programs some of the more significant programs are highlighted below 

the army’s wint program comprised over 790 of the group’s backlog at the end of 2008 information systems and technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast secure mobile commandandcontrol capabilities in 2008 the group received approximately 315 of awards for wint including a contract to provide specialized satellite communications earth terminals and technical support services for the first increment of the program 

the group’s backlog at year end also included approximately 730 for the ice2 program ice2 was the information systems and technology group’s largest single program in 2008 and supports critical intelligence and commandandcontrol systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide in 2008 the group received ice2 orders of 960 bringing the total contract value since inception to 31 billion 

approximately 385 of the group’s backlog at year end was for the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp under the mhp program the group provides integrated mission systems for 28 stateoftheart helicopters that are intended to replace canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters 

other programs that made up a significant portion of the group’s yearend backlog include approximately 310 for chs3 200 for netcents and 190 for rescue 21 the searchandrescue system for the us coast guard the group received 565 in orders under chs3 and over 160 of orders under the rescue 21 program in 2008 

in addition to these programs the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2008 including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the group’s backlog does not include approximately 103 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options the value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 13 years in 2008 funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over 35 billion more than 30 percent of the group’s orders to the group’s backlog most notably from ice2 chs3 and wint 

information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2008 the group was awarded a contract with a potential value of over 2 billion for the warfighter focus program the group received approximately 215 in orders under this program in 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 29 

2008 in addition the group received an idiq contract from the naval air systems command with a potential value of over 180 for integrated logistics support for foreign military sales 

corporate 

corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earningscost from our commercial pension plans 

corporate operating expenses totaled 75 in 2008 61 in 2007 and 47 in 2006 the increase in corporate operating expense in 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense see note p to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock options we expect 2009 stock option expense of approximately 80 to 85 the impact of the commercial pension plans on corporate’s earnings was not significant in the past three years and we do not expect it to be significant in 2009 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

in the mid1990s general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded our customer base since 1995 we have acquired 52 businesses for a total cost of almost 20 billion these actions have resulted in a larger more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility 

 

  

   our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks commercial paper rated a1p1 or higher and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the spanish government as collateral our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in highquality corporate municipal and us governmentsponsored debt securities the marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa we have not incurred any losses associated with these investments 

the following is a discussion of our major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 31 billion in 2008 29 billion in 2007 and 21 billion in 2006 in each year the two primary drivers of our cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits in the aerospace group in 2007 the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately 270 of contract funds upon resolution of the marine systems group’s request for equitable adjustment on the take contract in 2006 net earnings generated the majority of our operating cash flows though approximately 150 of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of noncore businesses the cash flow from these sales is reported in investing activities 

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to our expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained we along with the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 14 billion at december 31 2008 if this were the outcome we would owe half of the total or approximately 14 billion pretax our aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 690 we believe we have sufficient resources including access to capital markets to pay such an obligation if required 

investing activities 

we used 37 billion in 2008 852 in 2007 and 23 billion in 2006 for investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities 

business acquisitions in 2008 we completed five acquisitions for a total of 32 billion in 2007 we completed four acquisitions for a total of 330 in 2006 we completed three acquisitions for a total of 23 billion we financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions 

capital expenditures capital expenditures were 490 in 2008 474 in 2007 and 334 in 2006 the increase in 2008 over 2007 resulted from continued facility improvements in the aerospace group which are 

  

30 general dynamics 2008 annual report 

substantially complete the increase in 2007 over 2006 resulted from facility improvements in the aerospace and the marine systems groups we expect capital expenditures of approximately 475 in 2009 less than 2 percent of sales we had no material commitments for capital expenditures on december 31 2008 

sale of assets in 2007 we sold our coal mining operation for approximately 25 in cash net of taxes in 2006 we sold our aggregates business for approximately 315 in cash net of taxes 

availableforsale securities as a result of our strong cash position we have expanded our investments in availableforsale securities in recent years net sales of these securities were 17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of 179 in 2007 and 12 in 2006 

financing activities 

we used 718 in 2008 786 in 2007 and 539 in 2006 for financing activities our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 

debt proceeds net on december 15 2008 we issued 1 billion of fiveyear fixedrate debt pursuant to a form s3 registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of 1933 on december 8 2008 we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements capital expenditures refinancing of existing indebtedness including commercial paper and financing of acquisitions we received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances in 2008 of 904 which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions we had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2007 or 2006 we have approximately 2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program 

in 2008 we repaid 500 of fixedrate debt 150 of senior notes and 20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates there were no material debt repayments in 2007 in 2006 we repaid 500 of our fixedrate debt on the scheduled maturity date there are no material repayments of longterm debt scheduled until the third quarter of 2010 

dividends our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of 035 per share on march 5 2008 the 11th consecutive annual increase the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to 029 per share in march 2007 and 023 per share in march 2006 

share repurchases in 2008 we repurchased 20 million of our outstanding shares on the open market we repurchased 65 million shares in 2007 and 12 million shares in 2006 on the open market as of december 31 2008 approximately 49 million shares were authorized for repurchase by our board of directors – about 1 percent of our total shares outstanding 

nongaap management metrics 

our management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns in 2008 for the tenth consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment our return on invested capital roic increased by 160 basis points during 2008 to 185 percent our roic has grown 520 basis points since 2004 

we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic for 2004 through 2008 is calculated as follows 

 

   

general dynamics 2008 annual report 31 

our free cash flow from operations was 26 billion in 2008 25 billion in 2007 18 billion in each of 2006 and 2005 and 15 billion in 2004 we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

 over the past five years we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period an average 115 percent conversion rate we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and longterm liquidity needs we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy

  application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition we account for sales and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg contract milestones or units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we use such output measures otherwise we use input measures 

we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract our contracts for the manufacture of businessjet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 

we follow the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts however we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes which has been superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses on government contracts 

we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our longterm contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned while we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years most contractors use the cumulative catchup method 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on our best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more 

  

general dynamics 2008 annual report 33 

of our contracts we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria we consider the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 

goodwill since 1995 we have acquired 52 businesses at a total cost of almost 20 billion including five in 2008 in connection with these acquisitions we have recognized 114 billion of goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 

the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units these estimates require the use of judgment we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contracts our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “topdown” analyses including a market assessment of our enterprise value beyond the annual impairment test factors that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 

commitments and contingencies we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide federal government contractors we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period we determine the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease the following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and postretirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2008 

 

 as discussed under deferred contract costs our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide federal government contractors we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that

results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 

we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

new accounting standards 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities – an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas 161 expands and enhances required disclosures related to derivatives and hedging instruments sfas 161 is effective in the first quarter of 2009 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 161 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51 sfas 160 establishes new accounting for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective in the first quarter of 2009 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 160 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas 141r changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities the primary effect of sfas 141r is to increase earnings volatility associated with business combinations including a requirement to charge acquisition and restructuring costs to earnings rather than including the costs in the purchase price and a modification of the guidelines for recognizing intangible assets which may increase the value assigned to intangible assets and the resulting amortization expense associated with future acquisitions sfas 141r is effective for our acquisitions that are completed after december 31 2008 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and investments 

foreign currency risk 

our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries’ functional currency we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix or limit the adverse impact on the amount of firmly committed and forecasted nonfunctional payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities these contracts are designed to minimize our risk when we enter into transactions outside our functional currency we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

on december 31 2008 and 2007 we had 24 billion and 17 billion respectively in notional forward and option contracts outstanding a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of 12 in 2008 and 29 in 2007 and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of 112 in 2008 and 53 in 2007 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar euroswiss franc pound sterlingeuro and us dollareuro exchange rates we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these forward and option contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk 

financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments on december 31 2008 we had 31 billion par value of fixedrate debt and 905 in commercial paper outstanding our fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and we do not trade these securities in the market a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 

we have credit facilities with major banks of 1 billion expiring in july 2009 and 975 expiring in december 2011 these facilities are required by rating agencies to support the a1p1 rating of our commercial paper issuances we may renew or replace in whole or in part the facility that expires in july 2009 

commodity price risk 

we are also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices primarily on longterm fixedprice contracts to the extent possible we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract we have not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant we do not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

investment risk 

our investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of five years we held 18 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes on december 31 2008 our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 23 days as of december 31 2008 a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year historically we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values

general dynamics operates through four business groups – aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology 

aerospace 

the aerospace group designs manufactures and services a comprehensive offering of midsize and largecabin businessjet aircraft with nearly 50 years of experience in the aerospace market the group is noted for 

 

  

  

 to address the wideranging requirements of corporate government and individual customers the aerospace group offers a portfolio of six gulfstream aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options the varying ranges speeds and cabin dimensions are well suited to the diverse needs of an increasingly global customer base 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 3 

for the past several years the aerospace group has seen a steady increase in demand for its products around the world particularly in europe the middle east india and the asiapacific region notably while experiencing record growth in north american demand international orders surpassed north american orders in 2007 for the first time in the group’s history gulfstream also remains a leading provider of aircraft for government and military service around the world with aircraft at work in 34 nations these government aircraft are used for a variety of specialmission applications including headofstateexecutive transportation aerial reconnaissance maritime surveillance weather research and astronaut training 

to respond to this robust worldwide demand and to perpetuate that demand going forward the group has steadily increased annual aircraft production in each of the past four years has invested in innovative product development and significant facility improvements and has enhanced its global service network aircraft production increases have included both large aircraft assembled at aerospace’s headquarters in savannah georgia and completed at one of four largecabin completion facilities and midsize aircraft assembled at a supplier’s facility and completed in the group’s texas facilities to ensure that increases in production maintain profitability the aerospace group works closely with suppliers and invests in manufacturing productivity and efficiency improvements 

the group continuously invests in research and development rd over the course of each aircraft’s lifecycle to introduce new products and firsttomarket enhancements that broaden customer choice improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety comfort and inflight productivity the latest gulfstream to enter service the midsize gulfstream g150 demonstrates this innovation the g150 replaced the g100 model with an entirely new cabin design that incorporates a wider fuselage to improve passenger comfort the g150 has been well received in both north american and international markets since its entry into service in 2006 

in addition to meeting customers’ demand for the latest in performance technology and safety gulfstream’s new and upgraded aircraft models are designed to minimize lifecycle costs while maximizing parts commonality among the various gulfstream models four of the group’s aircraft – the gulfstream g350 g450 g500 and g550 – as well as the outofproduction gv share the same pilottype rating for multipleaircraft fleet operators this uniformity reduces training and maintenance costs and enhances safety in the operation of the aircraft 

current productenhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics flightcontrol systems cabin technologies and enhanced vision systems in 2007 and early 2008 the federal aviation administration faa certified two of gulfstream’s safetyenhancing products – the secondgeneration enhanced vision system evs ii and the new synthetic vision–primary flight display svpfd evs ii is a specially designed forwardlooking infrared flir camera that projects a realworld infrared image on the pilot’s headup display hud while synthetic vision provides threedimensional terrain images overlaid onto the evs ii images the products work in tandem to provide pilots with unparalleled situational awareness regardless of weather terrain or landingfield conditions 

in march 2006 general dynamics embarked on a 400 multiyear facilities project designed to create additional rd offices improve the customer sales and design center increase aircraft service capacity and create facilities to build nextgeneration aircraft in savannah key 2007 developments include

 combat systems 

the combat systems group is a global leader in the design development production support and enhancement of tracked and wheeled military vehicles weapons systems and munitions for the united states and its allies the group’s product lines include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 combat systems has established a strong foundation of key products that have become core platforms for customers across the combat vehicle armaments and munitions product lines these longterm production programs provide the group’s management the opportunity to pursue continuous process and productivity improvements to increase customer satisfaction reduce product lifecycle costs and improve the group’s financial performance at the same time the group applies its design and engineering expertise to develop product improvements that advance the utility and performance of these systems while identifying and positioning itself for opportunities in emerging and adjacent markets 

at the heart of combat systems’ core programs are the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and the abrams main battle tank the group is the sole provider of these vehicles – two of the key groundforce assets for the group’s primary customer the us army both of these vehicles have proven highly effective in operations in iraq securing their place in the army’s force structure for some time to come 

combat systems produces strykers under a contract awarded in 2001 with nearly 2400 units delivered to date and another 425 remaining through 2009 the stryker supports numerous missions with 10 variants infantry carrier command and control medical evacuation fire support engineering antitank mortar carrier reconnaissance mobile gun system mgs and nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicle nbcrv 

although combat systems has not produced new abrams tanks since 1996 it continues to support the army’s evolving needs with technological upgrades including the system enhancement package sep and the tank urban survivability kit tusk the sepconfigured tank is a digital platform with an enhanced commandandcontrol system secondgeneration thermal sights and improved armor the tusk increases the tank’s utility and crew survivability in modern urban warfare scenarios in addition through an innovative partnership with the anniston army depot the group’s abrams integrated management aim program refurbishes the oldest m1a1 abrams tanks to a likenew condition 

complementing these combatvehicle programs are combat systems’ munitions and weaponssystem programs the group holds leading or solesource munitions supply positions for products such as 

 

  

  

  

 in addition combat systems has been designated the principal second source for the us military’s smallcaliber ammunition needs the acquisition of canadian corporation snclavalin group’s munitions business in january 2007 enhanced these offerings and expanded combat systems’ international customer profile 

combat systems is also a longstanding leader in the field of highperformance weapons systems the group manufactures the m2 heavy machine gun and the mk19 and mk47 grenade launchers as well as weapons for most us fighter aircraft including all highspeed gatling guns for fixedwing aircraft and the hydra70 family of rockets 

in addition to supporting these longterm platform and supply programs combat systems has been active in supporting the united states’ ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan beyond providing armor kits ammunition and logistics support for forces deployed overseas the group has identified new technologies to respond to its customers’ evolving requirements among these are innovative solutions to detect current and emerging threats including chemical biological and explosive detection systems as well as systems to protect us forces against improvised explosive devices ieds 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 5 

to provide us soldiers with improved protection from mines ieds and other threats combat systems has established teaming relationships and has leveraged its available capacity and vehicleintegration expertise to participate in the defense department’s highpriority mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicle program the group offers two separate vehicles under this program the rg31 and the cougar which it produces as part of a joint venture in total these vehicles constituted approximately 3500 of the nearly 12000 vehicles awarded under this program in 2007 

the group is also beginning to see the effects of the high operational tempo of five years of warfare on us military assets which will require the refurbishment of battledamaged vehicles the replacement of equipment that has reached the end of its service life and the replenishment of ammunition and other supplies for the us armed forces as the principal contractor for the maintenance repair and reset of abrams tanks and stryker vehicles combat systems expects the sustaining and upgrading of us forces to become an increasing share of its contract mix 

the combat systems group is also focused on innovative technologies and is well positioned to participate in future development programs for the us marine corps the group continues the design and testing of the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv a new expeditionary combat platform designed to replace the service’s current craft the efv has a breakthrough design that provides sea maneuverability at speeds up to 25 knots and ground mobility equaling that of the abrams tank the company expects the marine corps to authorize production of up to 573 vehicles starting in 2012 

combat systems is a key team member in the army’s future combat systems fcs program and leads the system development of the fcs manned ground vehicle program combat systems is also involved in the development and production of precision munitions systems including the army’s guided multiplelaunch rocket system gmlrs and the excalibur artillery system – both currently in use in iraq and afghanistan in addition the group is involved in the competition for the joint light tactical vehicle jltv program to replace the army’s fleet of humvees ®  as well as the competition for the future rapid effects system fres in the united kingdom through these and other efforts the group is developing new technologies such as hybridelectric drive for combat vehicles autonomous navigation systems for robotic platforms and advanced systems for highspeed amphibious applications 

to expand access to new markets and diversify its customer base beyond the us government general dynamics has established a significant presence internationally the combat systems group has become a recognized militaryvehicle integrator and leading defensemateriel provider worldwide it has manufacturing facilities in australia austria canada germany spain and switzerland and has customers in more than 30 countries the group’s european business offers a broad range of products including light and mediumweight tracked and wheeled tactical vehicles amphibious bridge systems artillery systems light weapons ammunition and propellants like the group’s us market many of these systems constitute key platforms employed by its customers’ military forces these include the leopard 2e tank and the pizarro tracked infantry combat vehicle produced for the spanish army the pandur ii armored combat vehicle produced for the portuguese army and navy and the piranha wheeled armored vehicle which the group has sold to several european countries 

beyond the european market combat systems is experiencing increased international demand as a result of the demonstrated success of its fielded products in particular the group has opportunities to provide abrams tanks to egypt strykers to israel and light armored vehicles lavs and abrams tank upgrades to saudi arabia 

the combat systems group will continue to seek opportunities to improve performance across the business as it delivers on its substantial backlog in an environment of continuously expanding threats and evolving customer needs including an increased emphasis on speed to market the group remains focused on its customers’ requirements and the opportunities they present 

net sales for the combat systems group were 29 percent of the company’s net sales in 2007 25 percent in 2006 and 24 percent in 2005 net sales by major products and services were as follows

the substantial majority of marine systems’ workload supports the us navy through the construction of new ships and the design and development of nextgeneration platforms to help the customer face evolving missions and maintain its desired fleet size as well as maintenance and repair services to maximize the life of inservice ships this business consists of major shipconstruction programs awarded under large multiship contracts that span several years the group’s mature construction programs currently consist of the fastattack virginiaclass submarine the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 guidedmissile destroyer and the lewis and clarkclass take dry cargoammunition combatlogistics ship 

the virginiaclass submarine is the first us submarine designed to address postcold war threats including capabilities tailored for both openocean and nearshore area missions these stealthy ships are well suited for a variety of global assignments including clandestine intelligence gathering specialoperations missions and seabased missile launch 

the navy’s virginiaclass program of record includes 30 submarines which the customer is procuring in multiship blocks in late 2007 marine systems commenced sea trials for the fourth and final ship under the group’s costreimbursable block i contract the group in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction of these vessels is working on five of the next six ships under the fixedprice block ii contract deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2013 general dynamics expects to sign a block iii contract in 2008 for eight additional ships for delivery through 2018 as a result of strong navy and congressional support innovative costsaving design and production efforts and successful program execution the group expects to begin building two submarines per year as early as 2011 one year earlier than previously planned 

marine systems is the lead designer and producer of arleigh burke destroyers a sophisticated class of surface combatants and the only active destroyer in the navy’s global surface fleet during 2007 the group delivered uss sampson  the 28th of 34 ddg51 ships the navy has contracted with the company to build the six remaining ships are scheduled for delivery between 2008 and 2011 

the group’s take is the navy’s first new combatlogistics ship design in almost 20 years and the first navy ship to incorporate proven commercial marine technologies such as integrated electricdrive propulsion these technologies are designed to minimize take operations and maintenance costs over an expected 40year life the take ships support the navy’s sea basing vision by delivering ammunition food fuel parts and other supplies to us and nato operating forces around the world following the delivery of the first take in 2006 the navy deployed the ship to the arabian gulf in 2007 the group delivered the next three ships and work is underway on four of the remaining six ships currently under contract with deliveries scheduled through 2010 with one ship currently deployed overseas and three other ships in service the take class is already contributing to the navy’s forward presence posture the take contract was restructured in 2007 to include five additional option ships which could bring the total number of ships in the program to 14 the navy exercised the option for the 10 th ship and authorized procurement of longlead materials for the 11th ship in january 2008 

in 2007 the group completed the conversion of four trident ballisticmissile submarines to guidedmissile submarines or ssgns through close collaboration with the navy’s public shipyards the group successfully delivered the four ships on schedule and under budget the ssgns are multimission submarines optimized for conventional tacticalstrike and specialoperations support they allow the united states to engage targets quickly with surprise and from closein positions the first of the four boats uss ohio  successfully completed all postconversion testing in 2007 and recently departed on an inaugural 300day deployment 

the marine systems group is also participating in the development of technologies and naval platforms for the future 

with ddg51 construction nearing completion the group is focused on the design of the nextgeneration guidedmissile destroyer the ddg1000 zumwalt class the company has one of two contracts for the detail design of this multimission destroyer under a congressionally directed dualleadship strategy which requires that the vessels be procured from two separate shipyards in february 2008 the navy awarded the company a construction contract for the first ddg1000 

marine systems leads one of two industry teams awarded contracts for the design and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs a new highspeed surface warship designed to address emerging coastalwater threats the lcs is a multimission warship that can be configured to combat a variety of threats in nearshore waters including small boats mines and submarines marine systems’ lcs is derived from a proven commercial trimaran design and is well suited to accommodate the speed draft and cargo capacity requirements of this new combatant class of warships the group’s first ship is under construction at a teammate’s alabama facility and is scheduled to be launched in 2008 the navy cancelled the contract for the group’s second ship in 2007 and continues to assess future lcs construction requirements 

in 2007 the group continued to apply its design expertise on a joint defense advanced research projects agency darpanavy initiative to identify and overcome technological barriers to reducing the cost of future submarines the group is developing technologies to propel submarines with external electric motors and to reduce the ship’s infrastructure and improve its sensors 

in addition to these design and construction programs the marine systems group provides comprehensive ship and submarine overhaul repair and lifecycle support services to extend the service life of these vessels and maximize the value of these ships to the customer the group also provides international allies with program management planning and engineering design support for submarine and surfaceship construction programs

general dynamics 2007 annual report 9 

identity theft and preventing credit card fraud in addition based on strong capabilities in information operations computer network defense and the certification and accreditation of multilevel secure c4isr systems the group is well positioned to meet the emerging requirements of the air force cyber command 

general dynamics purchased two companies in 2007 that expanded the group’s capabilities in the intelligence market on october 24 the company acquired monteria llc of mount airy maryland which designs and manufactures technologies and systems dedicated exclusively to supporting the signals intelligence sigint community on november 13 the company acquired mediaware international pty ltd of australia which develops realtime fullmotion compressed digital video processing software and systems for defense intelligence and commercial customers 

although diversion of funding to highpriority war requirements has slowed the growth in some areas of the information systems and technology group’s broad portfolio the group’s increasingly diversified customer base has stimulated new opportunities in each of these principal markets as the group continues to grow it is positioned to take advantage of 

 

  

  

 net sales for the information systems and technology group were 35 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2007 and 37 percent in each of 2006 and 2005 net sales by major products and services were as follows 

 

 for additional discussion of general dynamics’ businesses including significant program wins in 2007 see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for information on the revenues operating earnings and identifiable assets attributable to each of the company’s business groups see note r to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

in 2007 69 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government 14 percent were to us commercial customers 10 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 7 percent were to international commercial customers 

us government 

general dynamics’ primary customers are the us department of defense and intelligence community the company has recently expanded its relationships with other us government customers throughout the nationalsecurity community including the department of homeland security and firstresponder agencies at federal and state levels the company’s net sales to the us government were as follows 

 

  the company performs its us government business under costreimbursement timeandmaterials and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and pays a fixed fee andor an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined by the company’s ability to achieve targets set in the contract such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and reimburses the company for materials costs the company’s production contracts are primarily fixedprice under these contracts the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount 

costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 40 percent of the company’s us government business in 2007 and 41 percent in 2006 timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent in each of 2007 and 2006 and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 53 percent in 2007 and 52 percent in 2006 

  

10 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally involve lower risk for the company they also can include fee schedules that allow the customer to make additional payments when the company satisfies certain performance criteria however not all costs are reimbursed under these types of contracts and the government can challenge the costs charged by the company in addition the negotiated base fees are generally lower consistent with the company’s lower risk under timeandmaterials contracts the company’s targeted profit may vary if actual labor hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates in addition the company generally charges materials costs with little or no fee which can dilute the profit margins associated with these contracts fixedprice contracts typically have higher negotiated fees in recognition of the higher risk and offer the company additional profits if it can complete the work for less than the contract amount however fixedprice contracts require that the company absorb cost overruns 

us commercial 

the company’s us commercial sales were 3732 in 2007 3831 in 2006 and 3396 in 2005 these sales represented approximately 14 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2007 and 16 percent in each of 2006 and 2005 the majority of these sales are for gulfstream aircraft primarily to fortune 500 ® corporations and large privately held companies customers from a wide range of industries operate the aircraft 

international 

the company’s direct nonfms sales to government and commercial customers outside the united states were 4751 in 2007 3828 in 2006 and 3369 in 2005 these sales represented approximately 17 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2007 and 16 percent in each of 2006 and 2005 

general dynamics’ nonus subsidiaries conduct most of its direct international government sales the company has an operating presence around the world including subsidiary operations in australia austria canada germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom general dynamics’ nonus subsidiaries are committed to developing longterm relationships in their respective countries and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers 

in the commercial sector most of the company’s exports are businessjet aircraft the market for businessjet aircraft outside north america has expanded rapidly in recent years particularly in europe the middle east india and the asiapacific region while the united states continues to be the company’s largest market for business aircraft orders from customers outside north america represent a growing segment of the company’s aircraft business exceeding 50 percent of total orders in 2007

competition 

several factors determine general dynamics’ ability to compete successfully in both the defense and businessjet aircraft markets while customers’ evaluation criteria vary from competition to competition the principal competitive elements include 

 

  

  

  

   

general dynamics 2007 annual report 11 

defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for defense products and services general dynamics competes against other large platform and systemintegration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally the company competes with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers operating in the local countries the combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses the marine systems group has only one primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also partners or subcontracts on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine and ddg1000 zumwaltclass destroyer the information systems and technology group competes with many companies from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies the defense market’s contractbased procurement environment and the longterm operating cycle of many of the company’s major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when the company performs successfully 

at times the company is involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of its competitors competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together broad capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements in these situations the company may have multiple opportunities to participate these include roles as the program’s system integrator overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants in the team or as a provider of a specific hardware or subsystem element such as military vehicles provided by combat systems or core mission systems provided by information systems and technology 

another competitive factor in the defense market is the us government’s increasing use of multipleaward idiq contracts to maximize the customer’s procurement options idiq contracts have been more common in recent years they allow the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a program and establish an overall spending limit under idiq contracts general dynamics must compete to be selected as a participant in the program and subsequently compete for individual delivery orders this contracting model is most common in the information systems and technology group’s competitions and recently has been used more in programs for which the combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has at least one competitor for each of its products with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance service quality and timeliness technological and newproduct innovation and price the company believes it competes effectively in all these areas 

research and development 

general dynamics conducts independent rd activities as part of its normal business operations over the past three years the majority of companysponsored rd expenditures was in the defense business in accordance with government regulations the company recovers a significant portion of these expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts in the commercial sector most of the aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs the company also conducts customersponsored rd activities under us government contracts 

research and development expenditures were as follows 

 

 employees 

as of december 31 2007 the company had approximately 83500 employees 25 percent of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions agreements covering approximately 12 percent of total employees are due to expire during 2008 historically the company has renegotiated agreements without any significant disruption of operating activities 

raw materials suppliers and seasonality 

the company depends on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints which can put pressure on pricing effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of the company’s successful performance the company attempts to mitigate these risks by entering longterm agreements with its suppliers or negotiating flexible pricing terms in its customer contracts the company has not experienced and does not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for its business operations 

the company’s business is not seasonal in nature the timing of contract awards the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are the primary drivers of the company’s revenue recognition

backlog 

the company’s total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions for additional discussion of backlog see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary backlog information for each business group follows 

 

  

intellectual property 

general dynamics is a leader in the development of innovative products manufacturing technologies and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property the company licenses some intellectual property rights to and from others the us government holds licenses to the company’s patents developed in the performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by the company’s patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of the company’s business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in the opinion of management have a material impact on the company’s business 

regulatory matters 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far governs the majority of general dynamics’ contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the far or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the far addresses the allowability of a contractor’s costs and how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far also subjects the company to audits and other government reviews these reviews cover issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to the company’s contracts the government may use information from these reviews to challenge the company’s contractrelated costs and fees failure to comply with procurement laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or administrative proceedings these might involve fines penalties suspension of payments or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

international 

general dynamics’ international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as certain us policies and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa they are also subject to regulations governing investments exchange controls repatriation of earnings and importexport control including the international traffic in arms regulations itar other factors that can affect international sales include currency exchange fluctuations and political and economic risks 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each individual aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type for safety reasons if they believe the aircraft does not meet their standards maintenance facilities must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 13 

environmental 

general dynamics is subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of some materials substances and wastes under existing us environmental laws a company may be designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency if a company is designated a prp it potentially is liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where a company has been designated a prp generally it seeks to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event a company is required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow the company to pursue contributions from other prps general dynamics regularly assesses its compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of the company’s operations historically these costs have not been material environmental costs often are allowable and recoverable under the company’s contracts with the us government based on information currently available to the company and current us government policies relating to allowable costs the company does not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows for additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls see note o to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in general dynamics’ common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase the company’s securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in general dynamics’ stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries there are however some risks that apply more specifically to general dynamics based on its type of business of course these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that general dynamics or any company faces additional risks and uncertainties currently considered immaterial could also impact the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

because three of general dynamics’ four business groups serve the defense market the company’s sales are concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition the company has expanded sales to international customers in recent years exposing the company to different financial and legal risks in the aerospace group’s market there are risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of the company’s us and international defense and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of commodities and subsystems 

the company depends on the us government for a significant portion of its sales in each of the past three years approximately twothirds of the company’s net sales were to the us government us defense spending historically has been cyclical though it is not clear that future defense spending will be equally cyclical defense budgets rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety at other times spending on the military can decrease while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years there is no assurance this trend will continue competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of spending which could impact the defense budget 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the company’s programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in the company’s existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could adversely affect the company’s ability to sustain and grow future sales and earnings 

  

14 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination the company’s us government sales are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract second future sales under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content 

in addition us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract in whole or in part for convenience if a contract is terminated for convenience a contractor generally is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor if a contract is terminated for default the government in most cases pays for only the work it has accepted the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the company’s future sales and earnings 

the aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and individual customers the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions and trends in capital goods markets a severe downturn in these market factors could adversely affect the sales profitability and backlog stability of the company’s aerospace group 

the company’s earnings and margins depend on its ability to perform under its contracts when agreeing to contractual terms the company’s management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess future labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed material cost and availability the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if the company faces unexpected contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected this could affect the company’s earnings and margins 

the company’s earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing general dynamics relies on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for its products subcontractors perform some of the services that the company provides to its customers occasionally the company relies on only one or two sources of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to meet its commitments to customers the company depends on these subcontractors and vendors to meet its contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements the company’s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries the company’s international business may pose different risks than its business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes government customers in newly formed freemarket economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature which can complicate the contracting process in this context the company’s international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s leadership national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if the company fails to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company’s sales and earnings associated with its international business 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 15 

the company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers virtually all of the products produced and sold by the company are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and systemintegration techniques and capabilities the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of the company’s government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly general dynamics’ future performance depends in part on its ability to identify emerging technological trends develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of the company’s business it must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers if the company is unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel future sales and earnings may be adversely affected

management overview 

general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation combat vehicles weapons systems and munitions shipbuilding design and construction and information systems technologies and services the company operates through four business groups – aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology general dynamics’ primary customers are the us military other us government organizations the armed forces of other nations and a diverse base of corporate government and individual buyers of business aircraft the company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation the majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 

2007 sales by customer base 

 

the nation’s engagement in the global war on terror coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven steady department of defense funding increases since 2001 in particular procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of the company’s revenues these budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases demonstrating administration and congressional support defense department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 68 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2008 while procurement and rd spending has grown nearly 8 percent annually during that period 

for fiscal year 2008 the congress appropriated 480 billion for the department of defense including approximately 175 billion for procurement and rd budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding and the company expects that this 2008 funding will be applied toward programs over the next few years for fiscal year 2009 the president has requested that the congress appropriate 515 billion for the department of defense a 75 percent increase over the 2008 funding this includes 184 billion for procurement and rd an increase of 5 percent over 2008 representing more than onethird of the total 2009 budget request 

during this period of war defense budgets have included the president’s budget submission as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter for fiscal year 2008 the administration requested approximately 189 billion in supplemental funding including approximately 75 billion or 40 percent for additional investment spending the congress has appropriated 87 billion of that request and will consider the remaining 102 billion in 2008 if this second supplemental is approved defense funding for fiscal year 2008 will total approximately 670 billion a 116 percent increase since 2001 while these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover current war needs in addition supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations these two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company’s programs 

looking ahead the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term led by the need to continue to support the operations in iraq and afghanistan while the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period the company expects nearterm defense funding to be driven primarily by the following 

 

  

  

  

 based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2008 and 2009

beyond the company’s us defense market governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to expanding defense export opportunities the company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies while the revenue upside can be significant european and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures as general dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world the company expects growing international sales 

the businessaviation market also continues to expand and 2007 was another strong year despite the recent uncertainty in the us macroeconomic environment the aerospace group’s north american and international order activity remains robust following seven consecutive quarters with a booktobill ratio exceeding one the aerospace’s record backlog extends through 2011 for largecabin models at this juncture management has not observed any indications of backlog weakness such as cancellations financing issues or requests to delay delivery 

the company expects continued growth in the businessjet market stemming from its strong products in the longrange and ultralongrange markets and robust sales of the company’s midsize products in particular the market for the company’s business jets outside the united states has demonstrated powerful growth in 2007 for the first time in the company’s history gulfstream received more than 50 percent of its aircraft orders from outside north america of note the european and asian markets comprised more than onethird of the group’s orders in 2007 and demand remains strong 

general dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements the company’s solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow general dynamics’ record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided the company’s management the flexibility to execute its operational strategy and enabled it to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

consolidated overview 

the following discussion of the company’s results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level the disclosures focus on the material financial measures the company’s management uses to evaluate the performance of each of its four business groups including sales operating earnings and margins and backlog for the defense business groups the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group’s results rather than types of products and services which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers for the aerospace group the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services consistent with how the group is managed 

in the defense business groups the majority of the sales are generated by longterm government contracts as discussed further in the critical accounting policies section the company accounts for sales under these contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable as a result changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 

in the aerospace group sales contracts for new aircraft typically have two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics the company records revenues at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft changes in sales in this group result from the amount of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion the level of service activity during the period and the number of preowned aircraft sold 

operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume performance or the mix of contracts and the phases of work within those contracts eg fixedpricecostreimbursable developmentproduction performance 

  

20 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract andor the estimated costs required to complete the contract the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 

operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are generally a function of the prices the company is able to charge for its various aircraft models the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the highermargin largecabin and lowermargin midsize aircraft additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margins include the number and type of preowned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group which include selling expenses and research and development costs 

results of operations 

 

 general dynamics generated strong results in 2007 compared with 2006 ending the year with the highest sales operating earnings net earnings cash flow from operations orders and backlog in the company’s history the company produced solid sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of the company’s business groups in particular the combat systems and aerospace groups generated the most substantial sales growth in 2007 due to strong worldwide demand for military vehicles and businessjet aircraft sales in the information systems and technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of anteon international corporation in 2006 as organic growth in the group’s north american market was largely offset by a scheduled reduction in sales in the united kingdom sales were up slightly in the marine systems group compared with 2006 

the company’s operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007 the result of significant operating leverage achieved in three of the company’s four business groups the aerospace group’s margins improved 120 basis points on the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements margins in the combat systems and marine systems groups were up 40 basis points and 80 basis points respectively due to improving operational execution overall the company’s operating margins increased 50 basis points for the second year in a row to 114 percent in 2007 the company’s continued focus on operations has generated four consecutive years of operating margin expansion and a total 260 basispoint improvement in margins over the past five years 

 

 the company’s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2006 increased new aircraft deliveries in the aerospace group strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the combat systems group and acquisitions in the information systems and technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales 

each of the company’s four business groups generated doubledigit earnings growth in 2006 in particular the marine systems group’s operating earnings grew over 50 percent due to significantly improved performance on its ship construction programs the aerospace group’s earnings also increased substantially on strong new aircraft volume and improved pricing on units delivered in 2006 compared with 2005 deliveries the improved performance resulted in an overall increase in the company’s operating margins from 104 percent in 2005 to 109 percent in 2006 

cash flow 

the company produced significant cash flows from operations in 2007 generating cash from operations in excess of net earnings for the ninth consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities was 29 billion in 2007 and 21 billion in each of 2006 and 2005 in addition the company generated over 300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several noncore businesses over the threeyear period the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase its common stock pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt the company’s net debt – debt less cash and equivalents and shortterm investments – was a net surplus of 268 at the end of 2007 compared with net debt of 12 billion at the end of 2006 the company achieved this reduction after giving effect to 330 spent on acquisitions over 500 of share repurchases 430 of companysponsored research and development almost 475 of capital expenditures and 445 of dividends paid during the year 

other financial information 

general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of sales were 60 percent in 2007 and 62 percent in each of 2006 and 2005 ga was 16 billion in 2007 15 billion in 2006 and 13 billion in 2005 the company expects 2008 ga as a percent of sales to approximate the 2007 rate 

net interest expense was 70 in 2007 compared with 101 in 2006 and 118 in 2005 interest income generated by the company’s strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of the company’s longterm debt have steadily reduced interest expense the company expects net interest expense of approximately 10 to 15 in 2008 based on the company’s substantial balance of invested cash

backlog 

general dynamics’ total backlog was 468 billion at year end up 7 percent from 437 billion at the end of 2006 funded backlog increased 9 percent in 2007 to 372 billion compared with 34 billion at yearend 2006 the company generated total new orders of 295 billion in 2007 representing significant order activity across each of the company’s business groups during the year 

the total backlog for the company’s defense businesses decreased 4 percent to 346 billion at yearend 2007 compared with 36 billion at the end of 2006 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog was 256 billion at the end of 2007 this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program the company has included in the backlog only firm contracts it believes are likely to receive funding 

the aerospace group’s total backlog increased 46 billion or 59 percent in 2007 reaching a new high of 123 billion at year end the group received a record number of orders during the year resulting in funded backlog of 116 billion at the end of 2007 up 67 percent over 2006 the funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the aerospace unfunded backlog of 665 at yearend 2007 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

the company’s backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft 

idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements which set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of the company’s idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the solesource supplier to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems however because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

contract options in the company’s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts if the customer exercises the option these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft the company recognizes options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

  

22 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

as of december 31 2007 the potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 145 billion up from 131 billion at the end of 2006 the company expects to realize this value over the next 15 years this represents management’s estimate of the potential value the company will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 

review of operating segments 

aerospace 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the aerospace group continued its strong performance in 2007 as sales and operating earnings increased significantly over 2006 growing global demand for business jets has led to successive years of significant order activity and resulting substantial growth in the group’s backlog to meet this demand the group has steadily increased its aircraft production rate and delivery schedule as a result new aircraft sales grew 22 percent in 2007 including a 22 percent increase in green aircraft deliveries and a 33 percent increase in completions in addition aircraft services volume increased by 20 percent over 2006 reflecting the growing global installed base of businessjet aircraft preowned aircraft activity declined significantly in 2007 as increasing numbers of customers chose to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them sales of preowned aircraft were 78 in 2007 compared with 217 in 2006 

the aerospace group’s operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2007 compared with 2006 operating earnings were up approximately 205 as a result of the increased newaircraft and aircraftservices volume improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 deliveries combined with labor efficiencies and productivity improvements particularly in the completion process contributed another 65 of earnings growth increased selling costs associated with the year’s substantial order activity higher productdevelopment spending and increased ga costs reduced the group’s earnings growth by about 90 reduced sales of preowned aircraft lowered the earnings growth by 14 the operating leverage achieved by the group offset in part by a mix shift to include proportionately more lowermargin midsize aircraft deliveries resulted in a 150 basispoint increase in newaircraft margins over 2006 aircraft services margins were up 50 basis points over 2006 overall the aerospace group produced a 120 basispoint increase in margins for the second consecutive year 

the company expects to deliver 157 new aircraft in 2008 an increase of 14 percent over 2007 based on this projected increase in deliveries the company expects the aerospace group’s sales will grow between 13 and 15 percent in 2008 combining the improved pricing in the 2008 scheduled deliveries with increased spending on research and development the company expects the group’s operating margins to be 20 to 40 basis points higher than those achieved in 2007 

 

 the aerospace group’s sales growth in 2006 was due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries new aircraft sales increased 22 percent in 2006 over 2005 green deliveries were up 27 percent while aircraft completions were up 24 percent the group introduced the midsize g150 aircraft in 2006 which added 14 green deliveries and eight completions aircraft services sales increased 15 percent in 2006 while preowned aircraft sales remained steady compared to 2005 operating earnings in 2006 increased approximately 150 as a result of higher new aircraft volume pricing improvements on all aircraft models overcame a shift in the mix of deliveries in the second half of the year toward proportionately more midsize aircraft deliveries to contribute an additional 25 of operating earnings improved margins on preowned aircraft sales increased operating earnings by 7 while higher product development spending and selling costs reduced the operating earnings growth by 33 

backlog 

the aerospace group’s backlog was 123 billion at the end of 2007 an increase of 59 percent over 2006 the group’s funded backlog grew 67 percent in 2007 to 116 billion at year end the group received a record level of orders for the fourth consecutive year and after increasing 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 23 

nearly 30 percent each year from 2004 through 2006 new orders grew over 60 percent in 2007 the group has achieved a booktobill ratio orders divided by sales greater than one for the past seven consecutive quarters 

new aircraft booktobill ratio 2005–2007 

 

 the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group’s orders and backlog 

 

  

 the group’s order profile in 2007 reflected continued strong activity in the north american market as well as rising demand around the world which resulted in a shift to include over 50 percent of orders in the year from customers outside north america for the first time the group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011 

combat systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 among the company’s four business groups combat systems experienced the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings in 2007 and in the fourth quarter generated the highest quarterly sales and operating earnings of any segment in the company’s history this strong performance resulted from continued growth across all of the group’s product lines with particularly strong growth in the company’s military vehicle markets worldwide as a result each of the group’s businesses experienced doubledigit sales and earnings increases in 2007 

over half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group’s us military vehicle business including core programs as well as adjacent market opportunities the ongoing us presence in iraq and afghanistan and the military’s need to reset and repair vehicles damaged in military operations continued to generate strong demand for the group’s combat vehicles and related services sales increased 31 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006 driven by the following primary contributors 

 

  

  

  

 the group supports the m1 abrams tank by providing upgrades including the abrams integrated management aim the system enhancement package sep and the tank urban survivability kit tusk stryker continued to be the group’s largest program in 2007 with volume up most significantly on contractor logistics support activity mrap emerged as a highpriority acquisition program for the marine corps and army during 2007 

the group’s munitions business also contributed significantly to the group’s sales and earnings in 2007 sales were up almost 50 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006 the munitions business generated approximately 15 percent organic sales growth with particularly strong volume in its large and mediumcaliber munitions supply contracts the remainder of the increase in sales resulted from the acquisition of snc technologies inc snc tec from snclavalin group inc in january 2007 snc tec is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small medium and largecaliber ammunition and related products to the canadian forces us and other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world 

sales in the group’s weapons systems business grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on a contract to produce systems that protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 

the group’s european military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007 increased activity on various programs to produce military vehicles for nonus governments was the most significant factor in the increased sales in particular volume was up in 2007 on the pandur ii wheeled vehicle contracts for portugal and the czech republic and the piranha wheeled armored vehicle programs for several european governments in december 2007 the czech republic cancelled the company’s contract for 199 vehicles the company is in discussions with the czech republic about a contract for a reduced quantity while these 

  

24 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

discussions may result in an overall reduction in the size of the czech pandur contract the company does not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group’s operating results 

the combat systems group’s operating margins improved 40 basis points in 2007 compared with the margins achieved by the group in 2006 margins increased due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group’s wheeled military vehicle programs the improvement in the group’s margins was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lowermargin acquisitions in the munitions business increased supplier costs on the group’s smallcaliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with the company’s exit from the group’s european commercial trading business 

the company expects 2008 sales growth in the combat systems group in the 9 to 10 percent range based on the group’s substantial backlog with operating margins improving 30 to 50 basis points over the 2007 margins 

 

 the combat systems group’s sales and operating earnings increased substantially in 2006 over 2005 sales in the group’s us and european military vehicle businesses were up 17 percent due to higher production activity on the stryker program and several european military vehicle contracts activity also increased on the army’s future combat systems fcs development program and various domestic and international lav contracts the group’s weapons systems and munitions businesses generated a 24 percent increase in sales in 2006 compared with 2005 high demand for protection systems for us forces and increased volume on a contract to provide smallcaliber ammunition to the army contributed to the growth in these businesses in 2006 the group’s acquisition of chamberlain manufacturing corporation’s scranton operation in 2006 contributed approximately 1 percent of the group’s total 2006 sales growth 

backlog 

the combat systems group ended 2007 with a total backlog of 129 billion an increase of 8 percent over 2006 funded backlog grew 7 percent to 108 billion the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014

marine systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the marine systems group’s sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006 approximately 60 percent of the group’s sales in 2007 and 2006 were generated by three of the group’s mature shipconstruction programs for the us navy – the virginiaclass submarine the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer and the take combatlogistics ship combined sales from these core programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006 in 2007 the group delivered ships two through four of the current 10ship take program to the navy driving volume up significantly while activity on the virginiaclass and the ddg51 destroyer programs declined during the year the virginiaclass program volume was down slightly due to workload timing the company expects to deliver the fourth and final ship of the costreimbursable virginia block i contract in the first quarter of 2008 and construction is in process on five of the six ships under the fixedprice block ii contract deliveries under block ii are scheduled through 2013 volume on the destroyer program began to decline in 2007 as the group continued construction of the remaining six ships under contract deliveries are scheduled through 2011 including two in 2008 

beyond these large construction programs volume was up across the group’s ship design engineering repair and overhaul and earlystage construction programs in process for the navy these include the detail design of the ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer and the construction of the first littoral combat ship lcs volume on these two programs increased over 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 the company’s lcs was approximately 65 percent complete at year end additionally activity was up over 10 percent on the group’s engineering repair and overhaul contracts for the navy in 2007 particularly in the group’s nuclear submarine support and logistics services business 

volume decreased in 2007 on the group’s ssgn submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs the group completed its fourth and final ssgn submarine conversion in 2007 marine systems’ commercial shipbuilding activity was down in 2007 due to the completion of the group’s fourship commercial tanker program in 2006 construction of the first two of nine ships under the group’s productcarrier contract has just begun overall combined sales for the ssgn program and the commercial shipbuilding contracts decreased over 50 percent in 2007 

the marine systems group’s operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales the group has generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs most notably the virginiaclass submarine the arleigh burkeclass destroyer and the ssgn submarine conversion programs experienced significant performance improvements during the year additionally the company and the navy reached an agreement in 2007 to restructure the take contract the agreement included a resolution of the company’s outstanding request for equitable adjustment rea which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships the navy exercised the option for the 10 th ship in january 2008 prior to the agreement the company was recognizing revenue on the take program at a breakeven level pending the resolution of the rea after the contract restructuring the estimate at completion for the program was revised and the company began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007 as a result of the improved performance on these programs the group’s overall margins increased 80 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006 

the company expects sales in the marine systems group to increase between 3 and 4 percent in 2008 with margins improving an additional 10 to 20 basis points over 2007 the company expects the group’s margins to benefit from continued performance improvements in its ship construction programs but to be constrained by a shift in mix away from the laterstage production contracts toward earlystage design and construction work 

 

   

26 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

the marine systems group’s sales increased in 2006 due primarily to a 20 percent increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the navy in particular activity was up in 2006 on the take contract the virginiaclass submarine program and the lcs program the group also began the detail design of the ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer in 2006 offsetting this growth was a scheduled decline in activity on the ssgn submarine conversion program and the completion of the group’s fourship commercial tanker program in 2006 the group’s operating earnings improved substantially in 2006 and operating margins grew 230 basis points over 2005 program losses in 2005 on the commercial tanker contract and in the group’s submarine maintenance and overhaul business adversely affected the group’s operating earnings and margins during that year operating earnings and margins in 2006 were favorably impacted by the absence of additional losses on these programs and by improved performance due to laborhour efficiencies and cost savings on the ddg51 destroyer construction program 

backlog 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts the group’s total backlog at yearend 2007 was 121 billion compared with 14 billion at the end of 2006 the group’s funded backlog at december 31 was 76 billion down from 94 billion at yearend 2006 the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years the current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2013 

the largest program in the marine systems group’s backlog is the virginiaclass submarine program the group’s backlog at year end included 55 billion for seven virginiaclass submarines to be delivered through 2013 as the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program the company reports the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but shares the construction and the earnings equally with its teaming partner in 2007 marine systems received a 270 contract to procure longlead materials for the first ship of the next block iii contract the virginiaclass program of record is scheduled to include 30 submarines and the company expects to finalize negotiations of the block iii contract by the end of 2008 

the group’s backlog at the end of 2007 also included 13 billion for the arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer program the backlog includes six ddg destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2011 including two in 2008 in parallel with the completion of the ddg51 program the navy and industry are transitioning to construction of the nextgeneration guidedmissile destroyer the ddg1000 zumwalt class the group has one of two contracts for the detail design of the ship and in 2007 the group received awards totaling approximately 700 from the navy to complete the design effort and procure longlead materials for the first ship the group’s backlog at yearend 2007 included over 600 for ddg1000 in february 2008 the navy awarded the group a contract worth 14 billion for the construction of the first ddg1000 with delivery scheduled in 2014

information systems and technology 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 sales in the information systems and technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006 and operating earnings topped 1 billion for the first time the group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core north american tactical and strategic mission systems and it and mission services businesses the it and mission services business also benefitted from the acquisition of anteon international corporation anteon in june 2006 these increases were offset partially by a steady but expected decline in volume in the group’s united kingdom business reduced activity in the group’s intelligence mission systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 27 

the strong performance in the tactical and strategic mission systems business was due to higher activity on several commandandcontrol and communications programs for the us military and increased volume on the group’s groundbased satellite communications programs notable drivers of the volume increase in 2007 included 

 

  

  

 volume was up in the it and mission services business’s core defense market on the strength of such programs as intelligence information commandandcontrol equipment and enhancements ice2 and networkcentric solutions netcents ice2 supports critical intelligence and commandandcontrol systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide and was the group’s largest program in 2007 netcents provides networkcentric it networking communications products systems solutions and system hardware and software to federal agencies 

sales in the united kingdom were down 33 percent as a result of the scheduled reduction in activity on the group’s bowman communications program for the uk armed forces 

in the group’s intelligence mission systems business sales decreased 9 percent in 2007 approximately a quarter of the decline in sales was due to the loss of a classified program in 2007 additionally this business has experienced procurement delays due to a reallocation of defense funding to support the wars in iraq and afghanistan 

the group’s operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group’s shift to include more it services content including the acquisition of anteon 

the company expects sales growth in the information systems and technology group in 2008 in the 5 to 6 percent range as solid organic growth in the group’s north american businesses overcomes a further decline in sales in the uk operations the company expects the volume on bowman to decline an additional 50 to 100 in 2008 at which point the program is expected to reach a steadystate volume of ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity for the foreseeable future the company expects that the group’s expanding services base will put moderate pressure on margins in 2008 resulting in a slight compression in the group’s operating margins in the 10 to 20 basispoint range 

 

 the information systems and technology group’s sales and operating earnings increased due to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 and modest organic growth in the group’s north american business the company acquired anteon and fc business systems inc fcbs in 2006 and three smaller acquisitions in the group’s tactical and strategic mission systems business in 2005 overall the group’s north american organic sales increased approximately 3 percent in 2006 due to higher activity on several key programs including ice2 netcents chs3 the canadian maritime helicopter project and muos within the group’s united kingdom business sales on the bowman program were down almost 20 percent in 2006 as the company began the transition from production and installation to maintenance and support activities the group’s margins in 2006 were down as a result of the lower margins associated with the group’s expanded service profile 

backlog 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog decreased slightly in 2007 to 96 billion compared with 10 billion at the end of 2006 at year end the group’s funded backlog was 72 billion down from 75 billion in 2006 unlike the company’s other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards and relatively few largescale longterm programs 

the largest program in information systems and technology’s backlog at year end is the army’s warfighter information networktactical wint program the group’s backlog at december 31 2007 included 900 for wint and its predecessor program joint network node jnn the army restructured jnn and wint into a single program in 2007 the company is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast secure mobile commandandcontrol capabilities in 2007 the group received approximately 950 of awards for wint to continue the design and development of the system and provide simulation and training 

the group’s backlog also included approximately 430 for the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp under the mhp program the company provides integrated mission systems for 28 stateoftheart helicopters that are intended to replace canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters

nongaap management metrics 

general dynamics’ management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns in 2007 for the ninth consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings the company employed this cash to complete acquisitions continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment the company’s return on invested capital roic increased by 130 basis points during 2007 to 169 percent the company’s roic has grown 450 basis points since 2003 

return on invested capital 

management believes roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects the company’s ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations the company uses roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management management defines roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic for 2003 through 2007 is calculated as follows 

 

 the company’s free cash flow from operations was 25 billion in 2007 18 billion in each of 2006 and 2005 and 15 billion in each of 2004 and 2003 management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends the company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows

  application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft 

  

32 general dynamics 2007 annual report 

inventory and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition – government contracts the company accounts for sales and earnings under longterm government contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg costs incurred or output measures eg units delivered as appropriate to the circumstances 

the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  however the company includes revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes which has been superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections  rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses 

the company uses the reallocation method because management believes the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on the company’s longterm contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods management believes these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and therefore the reallocation method is the method that best matches the company’s revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned while the company has applied this method consistently for over 30 years most contractors use the cumulative catchup method the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently considering a standard on the hierarchy of gaap which as currently drafted would eliminate the company’s ability to use this method of accounting 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

the company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria management considers the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim the company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 

business aircraft  the company accounts for contracts for businessjet aircraft in accordance with statement of position 811 these contracts usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion the company records revenue at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 

goodwill since 1995 general dynamics has acquired 47 businesses at a total cost of over 165 billion including four in 2007 in connection with these acquisitions the company has recognized 89 billion of goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 

the test for goodwill impairment is a twostep process that requires a significant level of estimation by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of the company’s reporting units and these estimates require the use of judgment management estimates the fair value of the 

  

general dynamics 2007 annual report 33 

company’s reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations this requires numerous assumptions including the timing of work embedded in the company’s backlog the company’s performance and profitability under its contracts its success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by “topdown” analyses including a market assessment of the company’s enterprise value beyond the annual impairment test factors that may lead the company to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of the company’s reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit the company has recorded no goodwill impairment to date and does not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 

commitments and contingencies the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on management’s best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans the company’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period the company determines the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease the following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the company’s commercial pension plans and postretirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2007 

 

 as discussed under deferred contract costs the company’s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government retirement plans as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the company’s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of annual changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 

management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices 

foreign currency risk 

the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers outstanding debt and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the company’s or one of its subsidiaries’ functional currency the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted nonfunctional payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities these contracts are designed to minimize nonfunctional currency risks andor risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had 17 billion and 11 billion respectively in notional contracts outstanding a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of 29 in 2007 and 4 in 2006 and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of 53 in 2007 and 40 in 2006 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in us dollarcanadian dollar and euroswiss franc exchange rates the company believes the recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged when taken together these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 

interest rate risk 

financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had only fixedrate debt outstanding the company’s fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market a 10 percent change in current interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the company’s fixedrate debt obligations the company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper but there were no outstanding balances at yearend 2007 or 2006 

the company’s investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of five years the company held 31 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments to be used for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2007 and 16 billion as of december 31 2006 given the weighted average maturity of 15 days as of december 31 2007 and 11 days as of december 31 2006 a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year historically the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates 

commodity price risk 

the company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices primarily on longterm fixedprice contracts to the extent possible the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk the company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant some of the protective terms included in the company’s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract the company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows

in the tacticalsystems area general dynamics continued to provide the joint network node jnn tactical communications system which was developed rapidly to meet the army’s emergent communications requirements in iraq the system provides broadband voice video and data communications for division brigade and battalion command posts since 2004 general dynamics has delivered 117 joint network nodes to the army in addition the army is considering using the jnn system as the program baseline for the transition to the company’s nextgeneration warfighter information network — tactical wint wint is a selfforming selfhealing voice video and data communications network that enables soldiers to exercise command and control of forces while on the move and with significantly less human involvement than existing systems 

similarly the group continued its work on network development and deployment programs for international customers in 2006 the group’s operations in the united kingdom delivered 3200 vehicle sets of the uk’s bowman tactical network which is currently deployed by the uk ministry of defence in support of operations in iraq in addition the group continued its work on bowmantype systems for the netherlands and romania and the battlespace communications system land or “jp 2072” for australia 

information systems and technology also demonstrated several soldierworn systems in 2006 that provide networked communications navigation integrated computing advanced sensors and helmetmounted optical displays for use by ground soldiers these technologies are integral to the army’s soldiersystem programs which involve land mounted air and futureforce warriors they are designed to enhance the warfighter’s situational awareness command capabilities and survivability to further advance its efforts in the area of enhanced soldier capabilities the group created a broadbased development initiative called the edge ®  through this collaborative testing and integration center the company is working to accelerate the delivery cycle of warfighter technologies and capabilities to users 

the group achieved another milestone in 2006 by delivering preproduction units for the joint tactical radio system jtrs program when deployed these lightweight softwaredefined radios will enable us forces to provide realtime links among soldiers intelligent sensors and platforms 

in the itservices market the group continued its support of critical intelligence and commandandcontrol systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations around the world in particular under its intelligence information commandandcontrol equipment and enhancements ice2 contract in 2006 general dynamics completed

two acquisitions to strengthen the information systems and technology group’s position in this market in january the company acquired privately held fc business systems inc a provider of a broad spectrum of engineering and it services to federal civilian customers in june the company completed the acquisition of anteon international corporation anteon a leading information systemsintegration company in the federal marketplace anteon’s deep domain expertise frontend systems development skills and intimate and diverse customer relationships provide the group the full spectrum of capabilities requisite of a toptier it integrator 

the company maintains a leading role in the development of an “open architecture — open business model” approach on several platforms these include the navy’s littoral combat ship the canadian defence force’s maritime helicopter project and a newly awarded program to employ an openarchitecture approach into a portion of the navy’s aegis combat system open architecture facilitates the rapid introduction of emerging technologies to platformbased mission systems using commercially available offtheshelf capabilities at significantly lower cost and risk than is feasible under older systems an open business model encourages competition from among many potential suppliers helping ensure customers have access to the latest proven technologies 

the group also continued its efforts in support of the us joint forces command’s joint experimentation program jexp and joint futures lab providing engineering technical and administrative services for joint concept development and prototyping jexp’s mission is to develop explore test and assess new warfighting concepts organizational structures and emerging technologies and to drive transformational changes that optimize the ability of all us military branches to fight as an integrated force 

the information systems and technology group’s operations have significant opportunities in the evolving homeland security and civilian federal agency arenas the group is the prime contractor on the us coast guard’s rescue 21 searchandrescue system a nationwide wireless command control and communications network designed to improve the coast guard’s ability to fulfill its mission the group has successfully installed the system in six major regions covering more than 2000 nautical miles of coastline and inland waterways of the east coast the gulf of mexico and the pacific northwest fullscale production efforts are underway for the remaining 30 planned regions the group is also one of two contractors selected by the us departments of justice homeland security and the treasury to participate in a design competition for the integrated wireless network iwn iwn is designed to provide secure wireless communications that are interoperable across 24 federal agencies as well as state and local first responders the group is also providing wireless capabilities to the state of new york as well as the national capital region in washington dc 

in addition the group holds one of 25 prime multiyear idiq contracts under the department of homeland security’s enterprise acquisitions gateway for leading edge solutions eagle program the group has one of only three contracts to provide a full scope of services to assist federal agencies in meeting the homeland security presidential directive12 hspd12 requirements for biometric credentialing the group is also providing the army with network engineering and integration support services under the total engineering and integration services teis contract and supplyinfrastructure engineering design and implementation support under the information technology enterprise solutions — 2 services ites2s contract these programs are representative of the group’s broad array of idiq contracts under which multiple government agencies are eligible to procure it products and services 

net sales for the information systems and technology group were 37 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2006 and 2005 and 36 percent in 2004 net sales by major products and services were as follows 

 

 in other activities in 2006 the company sold its aggregates business and initiated a plan to sell its coal business as a result of these activities the operations previously reported as resources have been reclassified as discontinued operations

competition 

several factors sustain general dynamics’ ability to compete successfully in all of its markets these include the technical excellence reliability and cost competitiveness of the company’s products and services its reputation for integrating complex systems and delivering them on schedule the successful management of the company’s businesses and customer relationships and a strong companywide focus on ethics 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 9 

defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for defense products and services general dynamics competes in this arena against other defense contractors ranging in size from large platform and systemintegration contractors to smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability internationally the company competes with us defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and stateowned defense manufacturers operating in the local countries at times the company is involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of its competitors key competitive factors in this market include technological innovation lowcost production program performance and market knowledge 

the combat systems group competes with a large number of domestic and foreign businesses the marine systems group has only one primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also partners or subcontracts on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine and ddg1000 zumwaltclass destroyer the navy’s littoral combat ship program has expanded competition to include another large defense company the information systems and technology group competes with a host of companies from large defense companies to smaller niche competitors with specialized technologies 

the us government’s increasing use of idiq contracts has changed the competitive landscape of the defense market competition involving idiq contracts is somewhat different from traditional procurement methods more prominent in recent years idiq contracts allow the government to select a group of eligible contractors for a given program and to establish an overall spending limit for the program under idiqs general dynamics must compete to be selected as a participant in the program and then compete for individual delivery orders this contracting model is most common in the information systems and technology group’s procurement competitions and has been used more recently in programs for which the combat systems group competes 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has at least one competitor for each of its six products with more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft the key competitive factors include aircraft safety reliability and performance service quality and timeliness innovative marketing programs value and price an important discriminator is technological innovation businessjet companies that offer nextgeneration technologies can gain a competitive edge the company believes it competes effectively in all these areas 

customers 

in 2006 68 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government 16 percent were to us commercial customers 10 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 6 percent were to international commercial customers 

u s government 

general dynamics’ primary customer is the us government particularly the department of defense the company is developing increasingly strong ties with additional us customers throughout the nationalsecurity community these include intelligence homeland security and firstresponder agencies at the federal and state levels the company derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from the us government either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor and expects its business mix will remain in this range for the foreseeable future 

the company’s net sales to the us government were as follows 

 

  the company performs its us government business under costreimbursement timeandmaterials and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are typically costreimbursement or timeandmaterials arrangements under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and based on the terms of the contract pays a fixed fee andor an incentive or awardbased fee these fees are determined based on the company’s ability to achieve contract targets in areas such as cost quality schedule and performance under timeandmaterials contracts the company is paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and is reimbursed for direct costs the company’s production contracts are fixedprice in most cases in these instances the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount in 2006 costreimbursement contracts accounted for approximately 41 percent of the company’s us government business timeandmaterials contracts accounted for approximately 7 percent and fixedprice contracts 

  

10 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

accounted for approximately 52 percent as noted earlier idiq contracts which can include task orders of each contract type require the company to compete both for the initial contract and then for the individual task or delivery orders 

each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally involve lower risk for the company and they may include fee schedules that prompt the customer to award increased payments when the company satisfies certain performance criteria however not all costs are recoverable under these types of contracts and the government has the right to object to costs charged by the company in addition the negotiated base fees on costreimbursement contracts are generally lower consistent with the contracts’ reduced risk profile under timeandmaterials contracts to the extent actual labor hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates the company may generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit fixedprice contracts typically have higher negotiated fee levels in recognition of the risk associated with these contracts and offer the company even greater profit potential if the company can complete the work for less than the contract amount however fixedprice contracts require that the company absorb cost overruns that might occur because of performancerelated issues 

u s commercial 

the company’s us commercial sales were 3833 in 2006 3396 in 2005 and 2777 in 2004 these sales represented approximately 16 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2006 and 2005 and 15 percent in 2004 the majority of these sales are for gulfstream aircraft primarily to fortune 500 ® corporations and large privately held companies customers from a wide range of industries operate the aircraft 

international 

the company’s direct nonfms sales to government and commercial customers outside the united states were 3815 in 2006 3369 in 2005 and 3236 in 2004 these sales represented approximately 16 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2006 and 2005 and 17 percent in 2004 

general dynamics’ overseas subsidiaries conduct most of the company’s direct international government sales the company has an operating presence around the world including subsidiary operations in australia austria canada germany italy mexico spain switzerland and the united kingdom general dynamics’ nonus subsidiaries are committed to developing longterm relationships in their respective countries and have distinguished themselves as principal regional suppliers 

in the commercial sector most of the company’s exports are businessjet aircraft the market for businessjet aircraft outside north america has expanded rapidly in recent years particularly in europe and asia while the united states continues to be the company’s largest market for business aircraft sales to customers outside north america represent a growing segment of the company’s businessaircraft sales

summary backlog information for each business group follows 

 

 research and development 

the company conducts independent research and development rd activities as part of its normal business operations over the past three years the majority of companysponsored rd expenditures occurred in the defense business in accordance with government regulations the company recovers a significant portion of these expenditures through overhead charges to us government contracts in the commercial sector most of the aerospace group’s rd activities support gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs the company also conducts rd activities under flexibly priced us government contracts to develop products for large development and technology programs 

research and development expenditures were as follows 

 

 employees 

as of december 31 2006 the company had approximately 81000 employees 24 percent of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions agreements covering approximately 3 percent of total employees are due to expire during 2007 historically the company has renegotiated agreements without any significant disruption of operating activities 

suppliers 

the company depends on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components these supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints raw materials can experience cost growth which would put pressure on pricing the company has not experienced and does not foresee significant difficulties in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for its business operations 

regulatory matters 

u s government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations the federal acquisition regulation far governs the majority of general dynamics’ contracts the far mandates uniform policies and procedures for us government acquisitions and purchased services also there can be agencyspecific acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for or that supplement the far for example the department of defense implements the far through the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars for all federal government entities the far regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

12 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

the far also provides guidance to government agencies about managing contracts after an award for example the far regulates the conditions under which the government can terminate a contract terminations can occur at the government’s convenience or for default if a contract is terminated for the convenience of the government a contractor generally is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed if a contract is terminated for default in most cases the government pays for only the work it has accepted 

in addition the far addresses the allowability of a contractor’s costs and how those costs can be allocated to contracts the far also subjects the company to audits and other reviews by the government these reviews cover issues such as cost performance and accounting practices relating to its contracts the government may use information from these reviews to adjust the company’s contractrelated costs and fees failure to comply with procurement laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or administrative proceedings these might involve fines penalties suspension of payments or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

international 

the company’s international sales are subject to the applicable foreign government regulations and procurement policies and practices as well as certain us policies and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa they are also subject to regulations relating to importexport control investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings other factors can affect international sales such as currency exchange fluctuations and political and economic risks 

businessjet aircraft 

the aerospace group is subject to federal aviation administration faa regulation in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each individual aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type for safety reasons if they believe the aircraft does not meet their standards maintenance facilities must be licensed by aviation authorities as well 

environmental 

general dynamics is subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes the company regularly assesses its compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of the company’s operations historically these costs have not been significant relative to total operating costs or cash flows environmental costs often are allowable and recoverable under the company’s contracts with the us government based on information currently available to the company and current us government policies relating to allowable costs the company does not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

under existing us environmental laws a company may be designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency if a company is designated a prp it is potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at a relevant site in cases where the company has been designated a prp generally it seeks to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event the company is required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow the company to pursue contributions from other prps for additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls see note p to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

the company is a leader in the development of innovative products manufacturing technologies and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property the company licenses certain intellectual property rights of third parties the us government has licenses to the company’s patents developed in the performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by the company’s patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of the company’s business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in the opinion of management have a material impact on the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in general dynamics’ common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase the company’s securities 

investment risks can be marketwide as well as unique to a specific industry or company the market risks faced by an investor in general dynamics’ stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries as described below a different range of risks apply more specifically to general dynamics because of the company’s mix of businesses and market exposure these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties currently considered immaterial could also impact the company’s business results of operations or financial condition 

companies succeed or falter in their ability or lack thereof to understand anticipate react to and manage all of these risks investors should carefully evaluate the quality of a company’s management as demonstrated by its ability to make decisions that build shareholder value over varied market economic or international conditions 

because three of general dynamics’ four business groups serve the defense market the company’s sales are highly concentrated with the us government this customer relationship involves certain unique risks in addition the company has expanded sales to international customers in recent years exposing the company to different financial and legal risks in the aerospace group’s market there are risks tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of the company’s defense international and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of materials and suppliers 

the company depends on the us government for a significant portion of its sales in each of the past three years approximately 68 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government us defense spending has historically been cyclical and defense budgets rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety at other times spending on the military can decrease while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years there is no assurance this trend will continue competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending which could ultimately impact the defense budget 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the company’s programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in the company’s existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings 

us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination the company’s us government sales are funded by agency budgets that operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract second future sales under existing multiyear contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscalyear basis even though contract performance may extend over many years changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs 

  

14 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds lead to changes in program content or lead to termination at the government’s convenience the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the company’s future sales and earnings 

the aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the aerospace group’s businessjet market is driven by the demand for businessaviation products by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and highnetworth individuals the group’s future results also depend on other factors including general economic conditions and trends in capital goods markets a severe downturn in these market factors could adversely affect the sales and profitability of the company’s aerospace group 

the company’s earnings and margins depend on its ability to perform under its contracts when agreeing to contractual terms the company’s management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events these projections assess future labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed material cost and availability the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates or if the company faces unexpected contract costs the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected this could affect the company’s earnings and margins 

the company’s earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing general dynamics relies on other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for its products at times subcontractors perform services that the company provides to its customers occasionally the company relies on only one or two sources of supply which if disrupted could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to meet its commitments to customers it depends on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements the company’s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services in a timely and costeffective manner 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries the company’s international business may pose greater risks than its business in the united states in some countries there is increased chance for economic legal or political changes the company’s international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s national priorities and budgets international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchangerate variability and differing legal systems in addition some international customers require contractors to agree to specific incountry purchases manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements known as offsets as a condition for a contract award the contracts may include penalties if the company fails to meet the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company’s sales and earnings associated with its international business 

the company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to develop new technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers virtually all of the products produced and sold by the company are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and systemintegration techniques and capabilities the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of the company’s government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly general dynamics’ future performance depends in part on its ability to identify emerging technological trends develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of its business the company must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers if the company is unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 

developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance while the company maintains insurance for some business risks it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities where permitted by applicable laws the company seeks indemnification from the us government in addition the company generally seeks limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of its homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 the company may elect to provide products or services even in instances where it is unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification

management overview 

general dynamics is a market leader in business aviation land and expeditionary combat vehicles and systems armaments and munitions shipbuilding and marine systems and missioncritical information systems and technologies the company operates through four business groups — aerospace combat systems marine systems and information systems and technology general dynamics’ primary customers are the us military other government organizations the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft the company operates in two primary markets — defense and business aviation the majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 

2006 sales by customer base 

the nation’s engagement in the global war on terror coupled with the need to modernize us military forces has driven steady department of defense funding increases since 2001 in particular procurement and research and development rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of the company’s revenues these budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases demonstrating administration and congressional support defense department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2007 while procurement and rd spending has grown 7 percent annually during that period for fiscal year 2007 the congress appropriated 435 billion for the department of defense including approximately 156 billion for procurement and rd for fiscal year 2008 the president has requested that the congress appropriate 481 billion for the department of defense an 11 percent increase over the 2007 funding this includes 177 billion for procurement and rd an increase of 13 percent over 2007 

during this period of war defense budgets have included the president’s budget submission as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter for fiscal year 2007 the administration requested and the congress appropriated approximately 70 billion in supplemental funding congress has recently been asked to provide an additional 93 billion which if approved will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2007 to approximately 600 billion an 87 percent increase since 2001 notably approximately 28 percent or 45 billion of the 2007 anticipated supplemental funding is requested for additional investment spending while these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover shortterm war needs in addition supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations these two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company’s programs 

looking ahead the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term led by the need to continue to support the operations in iraq and afghanistan while the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period the company expects nearterm defense funding to be driven by the following 

 

  

  

 based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2007 and 2008 

defense funding 2001–2008 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 19 

beyond the company’s us defense market governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs leading to expanding defense export opportunities the company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies while the revenue upside can be significant european and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures as general dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world the company expects growing international sales 

the businessaviation market also continues to expand and 2006 was another strong year in particular the market for the company’s business jets outside the united states is growing at an increasingly rapid rate in 2006 gulfstream received 42 percent of its aircraft orders from outside north america of note the european market including russia made up more than 20 percent of the group’s orders in 2006 and demand remains strong 

to meet this demand and maximize the company’s opportunities in the near term the aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries prudently while focusing on margins looking ahead as part of a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market the company is making investments in the aerospace group’s facilities to support the robust global businessjet demand and a growing aircraftservices market the company expects continued growth in the businessjet market stemming from a strong product selection in the longrange and ultralongrange markets and robust sales of the company’s midsize products

consolidated overview 

results of operations 

 

 general dynamics’ net sales increased significantly in 2006 with each of the company’s business groups contributing to the sales growth increased new aircraft deliveries in the aerospace group strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the combat systems group and acquisitions in the information systems and technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales higher activity on earlystage ship construction programs in the marine systems group also added to the sales increase 

the growth in the company’s operating earnings outpaced the increase in sales in 2006 doubledigit earnings growth occurred in all four businesses a key driver was performance in the marine systems group which saw operating earnings rise over 50 percent in the aerospace group operating earnings increased significantly on strong volume in new aircraft sales and continued pricing improvements for the company as a whole this led to a 50 basispoint increase in the company’s operating margins to 109 percent in 2006 from 104 percent in 2005 the company’s focus on operations has led to improved margins in each of the last three years resulting in a 210 basispoint improvement since 2003 

  

20 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

 the company produced strong growth in sales and operating earnings in 2005 the information systems and technology group led the increase generating over the half of the company’s sales growth over 2004 the combat systems and aerospace groups also contributed to the increase in sales while the marine systems group’s sales in 2005 were steady compared with 2004 increased volume in the information systems and technology combat systems and aerospace groups drove the growth in operating earnings the company’s earnings were boosted by the aerospace group whose earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005 driven by continued strong demand for business jets the growth was partly offset by program losses in the marine systems group during the year the company’s margins increased to 104 percent in 2005 compared with 102 percent in 2004 

cash flow 

the company’s cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years continuing the company’s consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations net cash provided by operating activities was 21 billion in 2006 and 2005 and 18 billion in 2004 in addition the company generated over 300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several noncore businesses over the threeyear period the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase its common stock pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt 

other financial information 

general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of sales were 62 percent in 2006 and 2005 and 61 percent in 2004 ga was 15 billion in 2006 13 billion in 2005 and 12 billion in 2004 the company expects 2007 ga as a percent of sales to approximate the 2006 rate 

net interest expense was 101 in 2006 compared with 118 in 2005 and 148 in 2004 the decrease in 2006 and 2005 resulted from interest income generated by the company’s strong cash position during the year the company expects net interest expense of approximately 85 in 2007 

the company’s effective tax rate was 323 percent in 2006 300 percent in 2005 and 327 percent in 2004 in 2005 the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 audit with the internal revenue service this settlement resulted in a 66 noncash benefit which reduced the company’s 2005 tax rate by 32 percent the company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 32 to 33 percent in 2007 excluding the effect of potential settlements or other discrete events for additional discussion of tax matters see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

in 2006 general dynamics completed the sale of its aggregates operation the company received approximately 315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an aftertax gain of approximately 220 in discontinued operations in addition in 2006 the company initiated a process to sell its coal mining operation and recognized an estimated aftertax loss of approximately 40 in discontinued operations in connection with the anticipated sale with the sale of the aggregates business and the expected sale of the coal business the operations previously reported as resources have been reclassified as discontinued operations 

in 2004 as part of its efforts to focus on performance general dynamics identified a number of operations that were not core to the company and could be divested as a result the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 the company received approximately 300 in cash net of income taxes and reported an aftertax loss of 8 in 2005 from the sale of these businesses 

the company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses and their operating results are included as discontinued operations net of income taxes for additional discussion of the company’s divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations see note c to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog 

general dynamics’ total backlog increased 7 percent in 2006 to 437 billion at december 31 the funded backlog grew 21 percent reaching 34 billion at year end in 2006 the company received significant new orders in each of its business groups totaling 265 billion including a record level of order activity in the aerospace group 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 21 

the total backlog for the company’s defense businesses grew to 36 billion at the end of 2006 compared with 341 billion at yearend 2005 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog was 271 billion at december 31 2006 this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program the company has included in backlog only those programs it believes are likely to receive funding 

the aerospace group’s total backlog reached a new high of 77 billion at december 31 2006 up 16 percent over the yearend 2005 backlog of 66 billion each excluding aircraft options the aerospace funded backlog an indicator of nearterm demand grew 19 percent to 69 billion at the end of 2006 as orders continued at a record pace the funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the aerospace unfunded backlog of 752 at december 31 2006 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

the company’s backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft 

idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements which set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of the company’s idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the solesource supplier to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems however because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

contract options in the company’s defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts if the customer exercises the option these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft the company recognizes unexercised options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 

as of december 31 2006 the potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately 131 billion which may be realized over the next 15 years this represents management’s estimate of potential value the company will receive the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 

review of operating segments 

aerospace 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the aerospace group produced significant net sales growth in 2006 due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries to meet increased demand in 2006 the group delivered 24 additional green aircraft a 27 percent increase over 2005 completions increased by 20 units or 24 percent a notable driver of the increased deliveries was the introduction of the midsize g150 aircraft which had 14 green deliveries and eight completions in 2006 aircraft services volume also increased in 2006 while preowned aircraft sales were consistent with 2005 of note preowned aircraft deliveries as a percent of the group’s total unit deliveries declined to 9 percent in 2006 from 12 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004 as more of the group’s customers chose to sell their preowned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in to the company 

the group’s operating earnings and margins increased in 2006 as a result of the additional new aircraft volume and continued pricing improvements in all aircraft models improved margins on preowned aircraft sales also contributed to the earnings and margin growth in 2006 these increases in operating earnings were counteracted somewhat by a mix shift in the second half of the year that included proportionately more lowermargin midsize aircraft deliveries as well as higher spending on research and development the group’s resulting operating margins improved 120 basis points over 2005 

  

22 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

the company expects substantial sales growth in the aerospace group in 2007 the group is projecting 139 new aircraft deliveries in 2007 a 23 percent increase over 2006 and the 2007 production schedule is substantially sold out based on newaircraft orders over the past two years the group anticipates continued pricing improvements on units to be delivered in 2007 the company expects the effect of these pricing improvements and continued operational efficiencies to offset a further shift in aircraft mix toward midsize aircraft and increasing product development spending as a result the company expects the group’s margins in 2007 to approximate those achieved in 2006 

 

 the aerospace group’s net sales increased in 2005 because of higher new aircraft sales and increased aircraft services volume green aircraft deliveries were up 14 percent and completions were up 9 percent this growth was offset in part by lower preowned aircraft sales operating earnings and margins in 2005 grew significantly as a result of increased new aircraft volume a more favorable mix of deliveries and improved pricing favorable cost performance in the aircraft services business and higher preowned aircraft earnings due to improved market conditions also contributed to the increase in earnings in 2005 

summary of aircraft statistical information 

sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics the company records revenues at two points – when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group’s orders and backlog 

 

  

 backlog 

the aerospace group’s backlog grew 16 percent in 2006 to 77 billion at year end the group’s funded backlog was 69 billion at december 31 2006 up 19 percent over 2005 the funded backlog made up over 90 percent of the group’s total backlog in 2006 the group received a record level of orders for the third consecutive year new aircraft orders have increased nearly 30 percent in each of the past three years for seven out of the eight quarters in 2005 and 2006 the group achieved a booktobill ratio orders divided by sales greater than one 

new aircraft booktobill ratio 2004–2006 

 

 the group’s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011 netjets inc netjets a unit of berkshire hathaway inc and the leader in the fractional aircraft market is responsible for a significant portion of the group’s backlog netjets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program the group’s funded backlog at year end included approximately 700 with netjets representing firm contracts for 32 aircraft including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2007 the unfunded backlog included approximately 550 with netjets for maintenance and support services the group also has 28 aircraft options with netjets due to the uncertainty and extended time frames associated with the largequantity aircraft orders historically placed by netjets particularly for midsize aircraft the company has removed from the backlog a netjets order for 50 g150 aircraft 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 23 

the company has also removed options for 50 g150s and 50 g200s that had been included in the aerospace group’s potential contract value deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from 2007 through 2011 and represent from 3 percent to 10 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years 

scheduled deliveries of aerospace funded backlog 

the group’s remaining 62 billion of funded backlog at yearend 2006 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately 375 of contracts with government customers 

combat systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the combat systems group generated substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2006 compared with 2005 the group benefited from strong domestic and international demand for its combat vehicles and armaments and munitions products due in part to ongoing us operations in iraq and afghanistan combat systems’ operating margins were down slightly in 2006 because of a shift in mix from highermargin products throughout the group including the exit from commercial trading activities in the group’s european operations 

the stryker wheeled combat vehicle contract continued to be the group’s largest program with total deliveries to date approaching 2000 units stryker deliveries in 2006 included the mobile gun system and nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicles the final two of the 10 variants in the stryker family of combat vehicles the group also experienced higher activity on several other combat vehicle programs during 2006 including the army’s future combat systems fcs program and various domestic and international light armored vehicle lav contracts in particular sales were up significantly in the group’s european business from volume that had been delayed on a number of vehicle production programs including the pandur ii wheeled armored vehicle high demand in the group’s armament business for systems that protect us combat forces was also a strong contributor to the increased sales in the group’s munitions business a late2005 award to provide smallcaliber ammunition to the army also made a significant contribution to the group’s growth in 2006 

the group’s acquisition of chamberlain manufacturing corporation’s scranton operation scranton operation on july 7 2006 contributed approximately 1 percent of the group’s sales growth over 2005 the scranton operation is a supplier of largecaliber projectile metal parts to the us government 

in january 2007 the group acquired snc technologies inc snc tec with operations in quebec canada from snclavalin group inc snc tec is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small medium and largecaliber ammunition and related products to the canadian forces other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world 

the company expects the combat systems group to experience sales growth in the lowdoubledigit range in 2007 including the effect of the snc tec acquisition operating margins in 2007 should improve somewhat over the 2006 margins 

 

 the combat systems group produced solid growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005 higher production activity on the stryker program was the largest contributor to this increase volume also increased on the m1a2 abrams tank system enhancement package program the canadian rg31 mineprotected personnel vehicle contract and the saudi arabian national guard lav contract in the armaments and munitions businesses demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor systems that protect us combat forces and large medium and smallcaliber ammunition these increases were offset in part by lower sales volume in the group’s european business stemming from delays in the timing of customer requirements and the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004

backlog 

the combat systems group generated 82 billion in new order activity in 2006 the group’s total backlog grew 28 percent to 12 billion at yearend 2006 funded backlog increased 45 percent in 2006 reaching 101 billion at december 31 the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014

marine systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the marine systems group’s net sales increased in 2006 due primarily to an increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the us navy activity continued to increase in 2006 on the take combat logistics ship and virginiaclass submarine construction programs in 2006 the company delivered the lewis and clark the first ship under the current nineship take contract ships two through six are currently under construction the virginiaclass program includes a fourship costreimbursable “block i” contract and a sixship fixedpriced “block ii” contract in 2006 the group delivered the texas and the hawaii the second and third ships of the block i contract the fourth block i ship is scheduled for delivery in 2008 and construction has begun on the first four ships of the block ii contract the group also continued construction of its first littoral combat ship and detail design of the ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer the growth on these programs was offset in part by declining volume on the group’s contract to convert four ballisticmissile submarines to a conventionalstrike configuration ssgn and its commercial tanker contract the group returned to service the second and third ssgns the florida and the michigan and completed the final commercial tanker in 2006 

marine systems produced significant improvement in operating earnings in 2006 resulting in an increase in operating margins of 230 basis points over 2005 the most notable impact came from the group’s commercial tanker program and its submarine repair and overhaul business in 2005 the group experienced 50 of cost growth on its contract to build four doublehull oil tankers which negatively impacted operating earnings and margins the final ship under this contract was delivered in 2006 two weeks ahead of schedule final settlement of the contract with the customer and efficiencies achieved in laborhour performance on the completion of the contract generated positive earnings on the contract in 2006 the group also recorded losses on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005 totaling approximately 20 these losses resulted from customerrequested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contract protection the group has implemented a more structured approach to managing customer change requirements and the performance in the group’s overhaul and repair business improved significantly in 2006 

operating earnings and margins in 2006 also benefited from increased profitability on the group’s arleigh burkeclass ddg51 destroyer construction program in 2006 marine systems delivered the farragut and the gridley the 26th and 27th ships of the class completed by the group the group continues to generate significant laborhour efficiencies and cost savings on the program which includes delivery of seven more ships through 2011 

the group experienced cost growth in 2005 on the navy’s take program primarily from engineering and designrelated changes imposed by the customer the company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking approximately 600 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused by these changes the navy is evaluating the claim and the company expects a resolution of this matter in 2007 the company is recording revenue at a breakeven level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim see note g to the consolidated financial statements 

the company expects sales in the marine systems group in 2007 to be similar to the 2006 volume with improving margins as the virginiaclass ddg51 and take programs in particular continue to achieve efficiencies associated with program maturity and shipyard capital investments 

 

 in 2005 the marine systems group’s net sales were consistent with 2004 higher volume on the virginiaclass submarine and take programs was offset by the completion of the seawolfclass submarine program in 2004 lower activity on the group’s commercial tanker contract and fewer repair and engineering contracts 

program losses in 2005 adversely affected the group’s operating earnings and margins as previously discussed the company recognized losses on its commercial tanker contract and two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts in 2005 which depressed the group’s operating earnings and margins 

backlog 

  

26 general dynamics 2006 annual report 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as repair and engineering contracts the group ended 2006 with a total backlog of 14 billion compared with 154 billion at yearend 2005 the group’s funded backlog was up 12 percent from 84 billion to 94 billion the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years the current backlog includes shipbuilding programs through 2014 

the backlog at year end included 7 billion for the virginiaclass submarine program the group’s largest contract in backlog the group has delivered three virginiaclass submarines including two in 2006 and the backlog includes seven additional ships two submarines are scheduled for delivery in 2008 with one delivery per year beginning in 2010 for the remaining five ships under contract the company is the prime contractor on the virginiaclass program and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner in 2006 the navy awarded the group contract modifications worth over 26 billion that provide funding for the construction of the eighth and ninth submarines and advance procurement for the tenth ship

information systems and technology 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the information systems and technology group’s net sales and operating earnings increased in 2006 due largely to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 in 2006 the company acquired anteon international corporation anteon and fc business systems inc fcbs to expand the group’s information technology it and mission services business the company completed three smaller acquisitions in the group’s tactical communications systems business in 2005 in addition to acquisitions the group experienced solid growth in its domestic it services and tactical communications systems businesses including the following key programs 

 

  

  

  

  

 increased demand for wireless network solutions for commercial wireless carriers also contributed to the group’s sales growth 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 27 

the group’s sales growth in 2006 was tempered by the anticipated decline in activity on several programs in particular the united kingdom’s bowman program and the pentagon renovation contract bowman is the secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces in the second half of 2006 the bowman program began transitioning from the production and installation phase to maintenance and longterm support activities the group’s intelligencesystems business also experienced lower volume in 2006 the group’s resulting organic growth over 2005 was approximately 2 percent 

in 2006 the group’s contract mix began to transition from a core holding of mature production programs to include more developmentstage contracts which typically carry lower margins and lower revenue levels in addition the group faced delays in some of its programs as the defense department shifted funds away from these contracts to support the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan these factors limited the group’s sales growth in 2006 and when combined with the impact of lower margins contributed by recently acquired businesses led to a slight decrease in the group’s operating margins for the year 

in 2007 the company expects 7 to 8 percent sales growth for the group with some reduction in operating margins as the group integrates the recent acquisitions and the shift in contract mix continues 

 

 the group’s net sales and operating earnings improved substantially in 2005 the group experienced a significant increase in activity on its programs that provide secure communications and network systems to us forces around the world including ice2 chs3 muos and the joint tactical radio system jtrs handheldmanpacksmall form fit hms radio internationally the bowman program and the mhp contract also contributed to the significant sales volume in 2005 acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 contributed about 40 percent of the group’s 2005 sales growth operating margins in 2005 improved over 2004 due to the timing and mix of contract performance phases and customer deliveries and cost savings achieved from the continued integration of acquired businesses 

backlog 

the information systems and technology group’s backlog grew 6 percent in 2006 to 10 billion at year end the group’s funded backlog increased 8 percent over 2005 reaching 75 billion the group continued to generate significant order activity in 2006 achieving a booktobill ratio orders divided by sales greater than one for the fourth consecutive year unlike the company’s other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog consists primarily of a large number of midsize contracts and programs as well as several largescale longterm programs awarded over the past few years 

programs that made up a significant portion of the group’s yearend backlog included over 600 for the uk’s bowman program approximately 500 for the mhp contract 515 for the muos program and 490 for ice2 the group received over 650 in orders on the ice2 program in 2006 

in addition to these programs the group received numerous significant contract awards in 2006

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

in the mid1990s general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base since 1995 the company has acquired 43 businesses for a total cost of over 16 billion these actions have resulted in a larger more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility 

 

  

   general dynamics’ management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns in 2006 for the fourth consecutive year net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings the company employed this cash to complete acquisitions continue its trend of annual dividend increases repay maturing debt and repurchase its outstanding shares as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment the company’s return on invested capital roic increased by 70 basis points during 2006 to 156 percent and has increased 320 basis points since 2003 

return on invested capital 

management believes roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects the company’s ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations the company uses roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management management defines roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity for the year net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus aftertax interest and amortization expense roic for 2004 through 2006 is calculated as follows 

 

 

the company’s free cash flow from operations was 18 billion in 2006 and 2005 compared with 15 billion in 2004 management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends the company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows

application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition– government contracts the company accounts for sales and earnings under longterm government contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the percentageofcompletion method the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses – either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered as applicable the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg costs incurred or output eg units delivered measures as appropriate to the circumstances 

the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

the company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable in evaluating these criteria management considers the contractuallegal basis for the claim the cause of any additional costs incurred the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim the company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 

business aircraft the company accounts for contracts for businessjet aircraft in accordance with statement of position 811 these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 

preowned aircraft inventories in connection with orders for new aircraft the company routinely offers customers tradein options under these options if exercised the company will accept tradein aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value it is the company’s policy to limit the aerospace group’s investment in preowned aircraft inventory at any point in time to 200 unless specifically authorized once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft the company records preowned aircraft at the lower of tradein value or estimated net realizable value the company treats any excess of the tradein price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction 

  

general dynamics 2006 annual report 33 

the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of preowned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors including current market conditions future market conditions the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment gross margins on sales of preowned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 

commitments and contingencies the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments pension and other postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on management’s best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans the company’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected longterm rates of return on plan assets the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period the company determines the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment including consideration of current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease changes in the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the company’s commercial pension plans and postretirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2006 

 

 the company’s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government retirement plans as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the company’s future earnings are not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 

management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

new accounting standards 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by setting forth the required methodology for recognizing income tax contingencies in the financial statements fin 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007 the company expects the adoption of fin 48 to result in an immaterial reduction to its reserve for tax contingencies 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap sfas 157 also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective in the first quarter of 2008 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 157 to have a material effect on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers longterm debt and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the company’s or one of its subsidiaries’ functional currency the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted nonfunctional payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities these contracts are designed to minimize nonfunctional currency risks andor risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company had 11 billion and 760 respectively in notional contracts outstanding a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized pretax loss of 4 in 2006 and 5 in 2005 and an incremental unrealized pretax loss of 40 in 2006 and 26 in 2005 this exchangerate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rates the company believes the realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged when taken together these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 

financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments as of december 31 2006 the company had only fixedrate debt outstanding the company’s fixedrate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market the company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper but there were no outstanding balances at yearend 2006 or 2005 

the company’s investment policy allows for purchases of fixedincome securities with an investmentgrade rating and a maximum maturity of five years as of december 31 2006 the company held 16 billion in cash and equivalents to be used for general corporate purposes given the average weighted maturity of 11 days a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings historically the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates 

the company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices primarily on longterm fixedprice contracts to the extent possible the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk the company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant some of the protective terms included in the company’s contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract the company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows

 aerospace 

the aerospace group designs develops manufactures and services a comprehensive fleet of advanced businessjet aircraft corporations private individuals and government users alike rely on these aircraft to fulfill a wide range of requirements the aerospace group is known for superior aircraft design safety quality and reliability technologically advanced onboard systems ontime aircraft delivery and industryleading product support 

since acquiring gulfstream aerospace corporation in 1999 general dynamics has implemented a strategy of continuous stable investment in the development of new aircraft models and technological innovations to keep gulfstream aircraft at the leading edge of business aviation as a result the group has revamped and expanded its entire aircraft product line to address additional elements of the businessjet market and introduced new technologies that enhance the reputation of gulfstream aircraft as powerful business tools 

in the past four years the group’s product line has increased from two to six aircraft offering more options at various price and performance points to businessjet customers than ever before four of the new aircraft – the g350 g450 g500 and g550 – share the same pilot type rating as the gv resulting in significant cost efficiencies for multipleaircraft fleet operators from both a training and a maintenance perspective 

investment in new technologies such as the enhanced vision system evs and airtoground communications capabilities has accelerated helping to ensure that gulfstream aircraft distinguish themselves from the competition in 2005 the aerospace group leased a 100000squarefoot building that will be dedicated in 2006 as the gulfstream research and development center it will centralize the company’s research and development efforts in advanced avionics and cabin technologies enhanced vision systems and sonicboom suppression in addition the group has continued its commitment to customer service providing awardwinning responsive support that helps maintain its outstanding record of aircraft safety reliability and availability 

  

general dynamics 2005 annual report 7 

with six aircraft models available at varying combinations of range speed and cabin dimensions the group competes aggressively and effectively in the midsize to ultralongrange market sectors 

in 2005 the aerospace group achieved a number of important milestones that continued to distinguish its products and services from its competition in cooperation with israel aircraft industries iai the company produced tested and certified its newest businessjet aircraft the midsize highspeed g150 which replaces the g100 certified by both the israel civil aviation authority and the us federal aviation administration faa in november the g150 offers an entirely new cabin design that can accommodate up to eight passengers with four passengers onboard the g150 can fly 2950 nautical miles nonstop farther than any other businessjet aircraft in its class 

the company continues to enhance the position of its products outside the united states in 2005 the european aviation safety agency easa and the joint aviation authorities jaa validated the gulfstream g350 and g500 this enabled the aircraft to be certified and registered by two agencies with extensive european and international membership broadening the market appeal of each in the asiapacific region the company has seen a marked increase in demand for gulfstream aircraft driven by corporate globalization and the growing popularity of international air charter services in the middle east historically a strong gulfstream market aircraft sales continue to grow 

because the high altitude capability range endurance reliability and efficiency of gulfstream aircraft are ideal for meeting a variety of mission requirements the company remains a leading provider of aircraft for government specialmission applications in 2005 the company delivered one aircraft to the japanese coast guard for a special searchandrescue mission one to the national center for atmospheric research one to the israeli ministry of defense and one each to the army and navy a german government agency also ordered a g550 for highaltitude research 

in 2005 the faa certified the company’s ultrahighspeed broadband multilink bbml system this advanced technology enables customers to access the internet at altitudes up to 51000 feet at connection speeds similar to those typically found in corporate offices gulfstream’s bbml service is up to 10 times faster than other widely used inflight connections video conferencing and voiceoverinternetprotocol capabilities are in development and are expected to be offered as options in 2006 

net sales for the aerospace group were 16 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2005 and 2004 and 18 percent in 2003 net sales by major products and services were as follows

competition 

several factors sustain general dynamics’ ability to compete successfully in all of its markets these include the technical excellence reliability and cost competitiveness of the company’s products and services its reputation for integrating complex systems and delivering them on schedule the successful management of the company’s businesses and customer relationships and a strong companywide focus on professional ethics 

defense market 

the us government contracts with numerous domestic and foreign companies for defense products and services general dynamics competes in this arena against other defense contractors at times the company has teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of its competitors key competitive factors in this market include technological innovation lowcost production performance and market knowledge 

the information systems and technology group competes with a host of companies from large defense companies to smaller niche competitors with specialized technologies the combat systems group competes with both domestic and foreign businesses the marine systems group’s market has only one other primary competitor northrop grumman corporation with which it also cooperates on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine and ddx destroyer the navy’s lcs program has expanded competition to include another large defense company seeking a role as a prime contractor 

businessjet aircraft market 

the businessjet aircraft market is divided into segments based on aircraft range price and cabin size gulfstream has at least one competitor for each of its six products with proportionately more competitors for the shorterrange aircraft the key competitive factors include aircraft safety and performance service quality and timeliness innovative marketing programs and price an important discriminator is technological innovation businessjet companies that offer nextgeneration technologies can gain a competitive edge the company believes that it competes effectively on all these criteria 

customers 

in 2005 67 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government 17 percent were to us commercial customers 11 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 5 percent were to international commercial customers 

u s government 

the company’s primary customer is the us government particularly the department of defense general dynamics is also developing increasingly strong ties with additional us customers throughout the national security community including intelligence homeland security and firstresponder agencies at both the federal and state level the company derives approximately twothirds of its revenues from the us government either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor and expects that its business mix will remain in this range for the foreseeable future 

the company’s net sales to the us government were as follows 

 

  the company performs its us government business under both costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are often costreimbursement arrangements under costreimbursement contracts the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and based on the terms of the contract pays a fixed fee andor an incentive or awardbased fee the company’s production contracts are fixedprice in most cases in these instances the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount in 2005 costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 46 percent and 54 percent respectively of the company’s government business 

  

general dynamics 2005 annual report 9 

costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts each present advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally involve lower risk for the company they may include fee schedules that prompt the customer to award increased payments when the company satisfies certain performance criteria however not all costs are recoverable under these types of contracts in addition the government has the right to object to costs and this could increase the company’s risk fixedprice contracts offer the company greater profit potential if the company can complete the work for less than the contract amount however on fixedprice contracts the company generally absorbs cost overruns that might occur 

u s commercial

general dynamics 2005 annual report 11 

environmental 

general dynamics is subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations these cover the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes the company assesses regularly its compliance status and management of environmental matters 

operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of the company’s operations historically these costs have not been significant relative to total operating costs or cash flows often they are allowable costs under the company’s contracts with the us government based on information currently available to the company and current us government policies relating to allowable costs the company does not expect continued environmental compliance to have a material impact on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

under existing us environmental laws there is a concept known as a potentially responsible party prp a designation determined by the us environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency if a company is designated a prp it is potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at the relevant site in cases where the company has been designated a prp generally it seeks to mitigate these environmental liabilities by obtaining the relevant insurance vehicles and by pursuing appropriate costrecovery actions in the unlikely event that the company is required to fully fund the remediation of a site the current statutory framework would allow the company to pursue contributions from other prps for additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls see note o to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property 

the company is a leader in the development of innovative products manufacturing technologies and systemsintegration practices in addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property the company licenses certain intellectual property rights of third parties the us government has licenses to the company’s patents developed in the performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by the company’s patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of the company’s business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in the opinion of management have a material impact on the company’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in general dynamics’ common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties investors should consider the following factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to purchase the company’s securities 

because three of general dynamics’ four major business groups serve the defense market the company’s sales are highly concentrated with the us government the customer relationship with the us government involves certain risks that are unique in addition to the us government the company’s defense businesses rapidly have expanded their sales to international customers in recent years which has exposed the company to a different set of risks the aerospace group’s market presents its own risks that are largely tied to us and global economic conditions despite the varying nature of the defense international and businessaviation operations and the markets they serve each shares some common risks such as the ongoing development of hightechnology products and the price availability and quality of materials and suppliers 

the company depends on the us government for a significant portion of its sales in each of the past three years approximately 67 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government us defense spending has historically been cyclical defense budgets have received their strongest support when perceived threats to national security raise the level of concern over the country’s safety as these threats subside spending on the military tends to decrease accordingly while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years there is no assurance that this trend will continue rising budget deficits the cost of the global war on terrorism and increasing costs for domestic programs continue to put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending which could ultimately impact the defense budget wartime support for defense spending could wane if the country’s troop deployments in support of operations in iraq and afghanistan are reduced 

a decrease in us government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the company’s programs being reduced delayed or terminated reductions in the company’s existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings 

us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination the company’s us government sales are funded by customer budgets which operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year in appropriations and authorization legislation once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted changes in congressional schedules negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract this in fact occurred during the 2006 budget process in which the defense appropriations bill was not approved until three months into the 2006 fiscal year delaying contract orders that would have been awarded in 2005 second funds for multiyear contracts can be changed in subsequent years in the appropriations process 

in addition the us government has increasingly relied on indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts and other procurement vehicles that are subject to a competitive bidding and funding process even after the award of the basic contract adding an additional element of uncertainty to future funding levels delays in the funding process or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination at the government’s convenience the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the company’s future sales and earnings 

the aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand or preferences for business aircraft the aerospace group’s businessjet market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for businessaviation products by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and highnetworth individuals the group’s future results depend on a number of factors some of which are beyond the company’s control these factors include general economic conditions and price and demand pressures in the market a severe downturn in these market factors could adversely affect the sales and profitability of the company’s aerospace group 

the company’s earnings and margins depend on its ability to perform under its contracts the company’s contracts require management to make various assumptions and projections about the outcome of future events over a period of several years these projections can include future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries if there is a significant change in one or more of these assumptions circumstances or estimates or if the company is unable to control the costs incurred in performing under these contracts the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected 

  

general dynamics 2005 annual report 13 

the company’s earnings and margins depend on subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing the company relies on subcontractors and other companies to provide raw materials major components and subsystems for its products or to perform a portion of the services that the company provides to its customers occasionally the company relies on only one or two sources of supply which if disrupted could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to meet its commitments to customers the company depends on these subcontractors and vendors to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner in full compliance with customer requirements if one or more of the company’s subcontractors or suppliers is unable to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreedupon supplies or perform the agreedupon services the company’s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected 

international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries the company’s international business may pose greater risks than its business in the united states because in some countries there is increased potential for changes in economic legal and political environments the company’s international business is also sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s national priorities and budgets international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems and customs in other countries in addition some international customers require contractors to agree to offset programs that may require incountry purchases or manufacturing or financial support arrangements as a condition to awarding contracts the contracts may include penalties in the event the company fails to perform in accordance with the offset requirements an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company’s sales and earnings associated with its international business 

the company’s future success will depend in part on its ability to develop new technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers virtually all of the products produced and sold by general dynamics are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration techniques and capabilities both the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies the product and program needs of the company’s government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly accordingly the company’s future performance in part depends on its ability to identify emerging technological trends develop and manufacture competitive products and bring those products to market quickly at costeffective prices in addition because of the highly specialized nature of its business the company must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by the company’s customers if the company is unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 

developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance while the company maintains insurance for some business risks it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities the company generally seeks indemnification where the us government is permitted to extend indemnification under applicable law in addition the company generally seeks limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of its homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 the company may elect to provide products or services even in instances where it is unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification

management overview 

general dynamics is a market leader in missioncritical information systems and technologies land and expeditionary combat systems armaments and munitions shipbuilding and marine systems and business aviation the company is comprised of four primary business groups — information systems and technology combat systems marine systems and aerospace — and a smaller resources group general dynamics’ primary customers are the us military other government organizations the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraftthe company operates in two primary markets — defense and business aviation the majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 

the current administration’s desire to modernize us military forces coupled with the us military’s engagement in the global war on terrorism has driven steady department of defense funding increases since 2001 for fiscal year 2006 the congress appropriated 411 billion for the department of defense a 33 percent increase in funding since 2001 this amount includes 147 billion for procurement and research and development rd activities an increase of 43 percent since 2001 procurement and rd budgets also known as investment accounts provide the majority of the company’s revenues and over the past several years these budget lines have enjoyed sustained increases that demonstrate continued administration and congressional support for fiscal year 2007 the president has requested that the congress appropriate 439 billion for the department of defense a 7 percent increase over the 2006 funding this includes 157 billion for procurement and rd an increase of 7 percent over 2006 investment funds in addition the president’s 20072011 future year defense program fydp anticipates investment funding growing at a nearly 5 percent compound annual growth rate led by 9 percent compound annual procurement growth 

during this wartime era defense budgets have evolved to include not only the president’s initial budget submission but also supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year for fiscal year 2006 the congress has been asked to provide at least 118 billion in supplemental funding which if approved will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2006 to over 525 billion an approximately 65 percent increase since 2001 approximately 20 percent or 25 billion of the 2006 supplemental funding request is anticipated for additional investment funding 

looking ahead the defense budget top line is expected to continue to grow albeit at a somewhat more moderate rate supplemental funding to support ongoing conflicts in part is linked to levels of deployed troops and conflict intensity and will likely decrease with a reduction of hostilities while this introduces some variability into the overall level of future defense spending based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2006 and 2007 

the importance of many of the companies programs to the future of the us military was highlighted in the 2005 department of defense quadrennial defense review this strategic document emphasized some core departmental missions including pursuing the global war on terrorism enhancing homeland defense efforts and encouraging the spread of democratic institutions worldwide the review highlighted many strategic priorities that are supported by general dynamics’ products and services including increasing special operations forces improving intelligencegathering capabilities accelerating the production of littoral combat ships and increasing submarine procurement

consolidated overview 

results of operations 

general dynamics’ net sales grew to 212 billion in 2005 up 21 billion or 11 percent over 2004 the company’s information systems and technology group contributed over half of the sales increase in 2005 in large part from continued strong demand for the group’s tactical and strategic communications and computing products the combat systems and aerospace groups also experienced strong sales growth during the year while sales in the marine systems group were consistent with 2004 

operating earnings increased 13 percent in 2005 to 22 billion compared with 19 billion in 2004 the growth in earnings resulted from the increased volume in information systems and technology combat systems and aerospace in addition the aerospace group’s earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005 driven by a number of factors resulting from improved demand for the company’s business jets over the past two years increased earnings were offset in part by program losses in the marine systems group overall the company’s operating margins increased to 103 percent in 2005 compared with 102 percent in 2004 

net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003 reaching 191 billion this sales growth came from increased volume across all of the company’s primary business groups and acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat systems groups 

in 2004 operating earnings increased at twice the rate of sales growth earnings improved from 14 billion in 2003 to 19 billion in 2004 an increase of 35 percent improved performance in each of the company’s major business groups contributed to the growth in earnings the aerospace group produced substantially improved earnings on steady volume as a result of significant costcutting efforts and process improvements while marine systems experienced fewer losses on its commercial shipbuilding programs compared with 2003 as a result the company’s operating margins jumped from 88 percent in 2003 to 102 percent in 2004

combat systems 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the combat systems group produced strong growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005 compared with 2004 the largest contributor to the increase was the stryker wheeled combat vehicle program volume on this program increased significantly in 2005 as the group continued production of the fourth and fifth brigades and began work on the mobile gun system demand for addon armor spurred additional program activity other notable volume increases include the m1a2 abrams tank system enhancement package sep program the canadian rg31 mineprotected personnel vehicle contract and the saudi arabian national guard light armored vehicle contract in the armaments and munitions businesses demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor counterimprovised explosive device ied systems and large medium and smallcaliber ammunition 

these increases were offset in part by the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004 including the ulan tracked armored vehicle program and the australian and new zealand light armored vehicle programs sales were also down in the group’s european business as a result of delays in the timing of customer requirements additionally combat systems experienced a temporary decline in volume in 2005 on the hydra70 rocket production program as the group transitioned to a new contract awarded during the year 

operating margins were down slightly in 2005 compared with 2004 because of a shift in product mix and the timing of deliveries in the group’s european business 

the company expects combat systems to produce doubledigit sales growth overall in 2006 with particularly strong growth in the group’s european business as the work that was deferred in 2005 is realized operating margins in 2006 should be consistent with the fullyear 2005 margins 

 

 the combat systems group’s net sales and operating earnings increased in 2004 compared with 2003 from increased demand for the group’s products in the united states and internationally several armored vehicle programs in the group’s european business contributed to the sales and earnings growth including leopard tanks ulan tracked infantry vehicles and piranha wheeled combat vehicles activity also increased on the group’s contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the army’s fcs program and in its munitions and armaments businesses this growth was reduced by a lower volume of m1 abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales growth in 2004 because of improved performance on several of the group’s programs and a shift in contract mix 

backlog 

the combat systems group’s backlog increased 7 percent in 2005 reaching 93 billion at december 31 funded backlog increased 9 percent over 2004 to 7 billion at year end the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2013

program losses in 2004 and 2005 adversely affected operating earnings and margins in marine systems the company continued to experience losses on its contract to build four doublehull oil tankers in 2003 and 2004 the company recorded losses on this contract related to performance problems schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties in 2005 additional schedule delays and labor hour growth resulted in a loss of 50 on the program the second and third ships were delivered in 2005 and the final ship is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2006 management does not expect any additional charges on the commercial tanker program though risk will remain until the final ship is delivered 

the group also recorded losses totaling approximately 20 in the first half of 2005 on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts these losses resulted from customerrequested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contractual protection the company is in negotiations with the customer to recover some of the incurred costs and does not expect to have this type of exposure on future submarine overhaul contracts 

the group has also experienced cost growth on the navy’s take program primarily from engineering and designrelated changes imposed by the customer the company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking more than 500 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused

by these changes the company is recording revenue at a breakeven level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim see note f to the consolidated financial statements the company is in discussions with the navy to quantify its contractual relief for the unanticipated costs and expects the resolution of this matter to take several quarters as of december 31 2005 the first take was 91 percent complete the second ship was 51 percent complete and construction had begun on the third ship the first ship is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2006 

the company expects the marine systems group’s sales in 2006 to be similar to the 2005 volume with improving margins assuming no further program losses 

 

 in 2004 the group’s net sales increased compared with 2003 from higher volume on the virginiaclass and take programs and the conversion of trident ballisticmissile submarines to a conventionalstrike configuration ssgn engineering and repair contract activity was also up in 2004 lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature defense production programs partially offset the growth in these programs operating earnings and margins improved significantly because of improved results on the group’s commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003 

backlog 

the marine systems group’s backlog consists of longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as repair and engineering contracts the group’s total backlog as of december 31 2005 was 154 billion including 84 billion of funded backlog the 2005 backlog was down 8 percent from the previous year as the group continued its progress on the significant volume of awards received in 2003 the current backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014 

the virginiaclass submarine program is the group’s largest contract in backlog the lead ship in the class was delivered in 2004 and the company’s backlog included 83 billion at december 31 2005 for the construction of the nine additional submarines under contract the current navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year through 2011 and two per year starting in 2012 the company is the prime contractor on this program and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner in 2005 the navy awarded marine systems a contract worth over 100 to provide leadyard services and researchanddevelopment studies for virginiaclass submarines in support of the related construction contract in january 2006 the navy awarded the group a contract modification worth 13 billion that provides funding for the construction of the eighth virginiaclass submarine and advance procurement for the ninth and tenth ships 

the group’s backlog at yearend 2005 included 25 billion for nine arleigh burkeclass ddg destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010 in 2005 the navy awarded the company approximately 560 in funding to construct the final destroyer under contract in the ddg program 

the navy exercised two options in 2005 worth approximately 590 for the seventh and eighth ships in the take program bringing the total contract value to 25 billion the group’s backlog at the end of 2005 included 17 billion for the construction of the first eight take ships deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2008 in january 2006 the navy exercised an option worth approximately 320 for the ninth take ship bringing the total contract value to 28 billion 

in 2005 the navy modified the marine systems group’s ssgn contract adding approximately 320 under this contract the company is converting four trident ballisticmissile submarines to an ssgn configuration a multimission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special operations support the 2005 awards cover the conversion of the third and fourth ships the uss michigan and the uss georgia  and bring the total value of the contract to 13 billion the conversion of the uss ohio was completed in 2005 

marine systems leads one of two teams selected for the development and construction of the littoral combat ship lcs the navy’s newest class of highspeed surface combatants lcs ships are designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats highspeed swarm boats mines and diesel submarines in 2005 the navy exercised an option worth 223 for the detailed design and construction of the lcs the company’s first lcs is expected to be delivered in 2007 

the group also received a sevenyear contract from the navy in 2005 worth approximately 200 for the maintenance and repair of four lsdclass and four lpdclass ships these amphibious ships transport marines and their combat equipment to areas throughout the world and launch and support landing craft and helicopters during amphibious assault and other military operations

aerospace 

results of operations and outlook 

 

 the aerospace group’s net sales increased in 2005 compared with 2004 on a significant jump in new aircraft volume and higher aircraft services activity the company delivered 11 more green units and seven more completions in 2005 than in 2004 reflecting a strong increase in demand over the past two years preowned sales declined as the group’s customers increasingly opt to sell their preowned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in with the company 

the group’s 2005 operating earnings increased significantly over 2004 a number of factors contributed to this strong earnings growth earnings in new aircraft manufacturing improved due to a combination of increased deliveries a more favorable mix of units delivered and improving pricing aircraft services earnings increased from the higher volume and improved cost performance preowned aircraft earnings were up substantially on three fewer deliveries as market conditions continue to improve 

new aircraft orders in 2005 exceeded 2004’s record level and new aircraft pricing continued to improve during the year gulfstream has raised its planned production for 2006 by more than 25 percent over 2005 and the 2006 production schedule is substantially sold out the company expects significant sales growth in the aerospace group in 2006 with margins that approximate those achieved in 2005 the company expects a shift in mix in the group starting in 2006 due to increased production of lowermargin midsize aircraft with the introduction of the new g150 

 

 net sales in the aerospace group grew slightly in 2004 over 2003 increased new aircraft sales and higher aircraft services activity were offset by lower preowned aircraft sales operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2004 because of significant cost reductions higher earnings on preowned aircraft sales and a more favorable mix of aircraft deliveries 

summary of aircraft statistical information 

sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics the company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft

backlog 

the aerospace group’s backlog exceeded 8 billion at the end of 2005 an increase of 18 percent over 2004 the group’s funded backlog grew 26 percent in 2005 to 59 billion at year end representing almost 75 percent of the total backlog the group received 124 orders in 2005 28 percent more than the record number of orders received in 2004 excluding fractional activity in the fourth quarter of 2005 the aerospace group achieved a booktobill ratio net orders divided by sales greater than one for the sixth consecutive quarter 

the group’s backlog includes aircraft deliveries through 2011 a significant portion of the group’s backlog is with netjets inc netjets a unit of berkshire hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market netjets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program the group’s funded backlog at year end included 16 billion with netjets representing firm contracts for 91 aircraft including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2006 the unfunded backlog included 14 billion for 100 aircraft options from netjets constituting all of the options in backlog netjets also represented 69 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from 2006 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 11 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years 

the group’s remaining 43 billion of funded backlog at yearend 2005 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately 470 of contracts with government customers

resources 

the company’s resources group consists of two businesses a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry 

results of operations 

 

 the group’s net sales in 2004 decreased slightly compared with 2003 as lower volume in the coal business was largely offset by increased activity in the aggregates business the group’s 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company’s coal mining operations

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

in the mid1990s general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base since 1995 the company has acquired 40 businesses at a total cost of almost 14 billion this has resulted in a larger more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility 

general dynamics’ management continues to emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash in 2005 net cash provided by operating activities greatly exceeded net earnings for the third consecutive year the company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares the company ended 2005 with a cash balance of 23 billion total debt of 33 billion and a debttocapital ratio of 288 percent 

free cash flow from operations was 18 billion in 2005 compared with 15 billion in both 2004 and 2003 management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

 over the past 10 years the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its net earnings during the period with free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2006 the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short and longterm liquidity needs management believes that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy 

the following is a discussion of the company’s major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 21 billion in 2005 18 billion in 2004 and 17 billion in 2003 in each year net earnings was the primary driver of the company’s cash flow in 2005 the additional cash flow was due to a high level of customer deposits associated with the order activity in the aerospace group and a significant inflow of customer advances in the fourth quarter in the company’s european business in 2004 cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings due primarily to the timing of tax payments in 2003 the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and preowned aircraft inventory in the aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year 

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to the company’s expectations the default termination ultimately is sustained the company and the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 12 billion at december 31 2005 if this were the outcome the government contends the company would owe approximately 13 billion the company’s aftertax cash obligation would be approximately 640 the company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation if required while still retaining ample liquidity

  application of critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

revenue recognition – government contracts the company accounts for sales and earnings under longterm government contracts and programs using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses 

the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg costs incurred or output eg units delivered measures as appropriate to the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of materials the impact of delayed performance the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

business aircraft the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position 811 these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

  

general dynamics 2005 annual report 31 

the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 

preowned aircraft inventories in connection with orders for new aircraft the company routinely offers customers tradein options under these options if exercised the company will accept tradein aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value it is the company’s policy to limit its investment in preowned aircraft inventory at any point in time to 200 unless specifically authorized once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft the company records preowned aircraft at the lower of tradein value or estimated net realizable value the company treats any excess of the tradein price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of preowned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors including current market conditions future market conditions the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment gross margins on sales of preowned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 

commitments and contingencies the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments postretirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business including both existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

retirement plans the company’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates the key assumptions relate to discount rates used to estimate future liabilities and longterm rates of return on plan assets the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on highquality fixedincome investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period the company determines the longterm rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment including consideration of both current and future market conditions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension and postretirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 

if the assumed longterm rate of return on pension plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 in 2005 likewise had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately 1 in 2005 a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in either the rate of return on assets or the interest rate used for benefit obligations for the company’s postretirement benefit plans would have decreased or increased the 2005 postretirement benefit cost by approximately 1 the company’s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors  the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 

management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments as of december 31 2005 the company had no material shortterm investments and no outstanding commercial paper fixedrate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market therefore the company does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk is material for its fixedrate debt 

the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2005 no interest rate swap agreements were in effect 

the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers longterm debt and certain intercompany transactions in foreign currencies the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreigndenominated payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2005 and 2004 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of 5 and 14 pretax respectively and an incremental unrealized loss of 26 and 56 pretax respectively this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rates consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations these realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged when taken together these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk

products and services 

  

  

information systems and technology 

  

the information systems and technology group provides systems integration expertise hardware and software products and support services in three principal defense and intelligence markets 

  

   

   

   

acquisitions and new program wins since 1997 have combined to build capabilities in each of these markets across a wide range of platforms on land at sea in the air and in space the group’s expertise in integrating command control and communication systems is its core business information systems and technology’s relationship with the intelligence community is strong and growing in particular many of its systems and products in the informationassurance arena are vital to us intelligence operations the group’s position in the expanding it services marketplace has grown from its principal offering of network infrastructure installation into a diverse suite of it services across the us department of defense the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies 

  

for the second year in a row information systems and technology is the company’s largest segment contributing 35 percent of total revenues in 2004 this growth reflects the increasing importance of digital networkcentric c4isr and informationsharing technologies in the defense and intelligence communities as the nature of conflicts evolves information sharing and networkcentric warfare will become increasingly important in the widely dispersed battlefields of the future overcoming the challenges the armed services and intelligence community face will require continued innovation interoperable technologies and a greater reliance on integrated ground sea air and space systems 

  

the information systems and technology group supports these requirements with quick responses to changing warfighter needs enabled by its deep understanding of the customer’s operating environment this intimate knowledge has developed over time as the company

with seven aircraft models available at varying price and performance points the group competes aggressively and effectively in market sectors from midsize to ultralongrange 

  

  

6 general dynamics 2004 annual report 

in 2004 the aerospace group achieved a number of important milestones that continued to distinguish its products and services from its competition the company introduced the new largecabin midrange gulfstream g350 in february and received type certifications from the us federal aviation administration faa or the european aviation safety agency for the gulfstream g550 gulfstream g450 gulfstream g350 and gulfstream g200 these certifications enable the aircraft to be registered in the united states and 25 european nations broadening the market appeal of each 

  

also the faa granted identical pilottype ratings for the g550 g500 gv g450 and g350 creating safety cost and convenience benefits for gulfstream fleet operators in terms of pilot training operations parts inventory and maintenance 

  

in october 2004 the group unveiled a fullscale mockup of the new gulfstream g150 this aircraft with a redesigned cabin and streamlined fuselage will provide customers with the speed and range of the gulfstream g100 and the comfort of a wider cabin the g150 enters production in 2005 with first customer delivery scheduled for 2006 

  

along with new products aerospace continues to enhance aircraft models even after their initial introduction major achievements include the gulfstream enhanced vision system evs which uses a forwardlooking infrared flir camera to enable flight crews to see runway markings taxiways adjacent roads and surrounding areas in conditions of limited visibility evs was initially introduced in 2001 and remains the only faacertified system of its type the faa awarded gulfstream its 2004 award of excellence in aviation research for the system 

  

gulfstream introduced its new broad band multilink bbml capability in 2004 this advanced technology enables customers to access the internet at 51000 feet at connection speeds similar to those they experience in their offices a future option will allow video teleconferencing gulfstream’s bbml is up to 10 times faster than competitive systems and has up to 75 percent lower perminute operating costs 

  

these achievements frequently result in industry recognition that further enhances the group’s reputation for example in 2004 the national aeronautic association presented the gulfstream g550 team with the robert j collier trophy the award cited the team for “its leadingedge achievement in designing testing and building an innovative aircraft while incorporating measurable safety enhancements and farreaching advances in aerospace technology” 

  

also in 2004 both professional pilot and aviation international news judged the aerospace group number one in product support for the second year in a row based on independent surveys of businessjet operations all six service centers under the gulfstream name have been awarded the prestigious diamond award of excellence for training by the faa as have the five service centers that operate under the general dynamics aviation services banner 

  

net sales for the aerospace group were 16 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2004 18 percent in 2003 and 24 percent in 2002 net sales by major products and services were as follows

competition 

  

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends on the technical excellence and reliability of its products and services its reputation for integrating complex systems the successful management of the company’s businesses and customer relationships and the cost competitiveness of its products and services the company relies on these factors in the two primary markets in which it competes defense and businessjet aircraft 

  

defense market 

  

the defense market is served by numerous domestic and foreign companies that offer a range of products and services and that compete with the company for many of its contracts on occasion the company is involved in subcontracting relationships with some of these competitors the key competitive factors in this market are technological innovation lowcost production performance and market knowledge 

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 7 

the information systems and technology group competes with a broad range of entities from large defense companies to smaller niche competitors with specialized technologies and often teams with other companies the combat systems group competes with both domestic and foreign entities on occasion the company partners with some of these entities and currently is in a teaming arrangement with another us defense contractor on the manned vehicle portion of the fcs program the marine systems group operates in a market with only one other primary competitor northrop grumman corporation however the company also teams with it on several programs including the virginiaclass submarine construction contract the navy’s lcs program has expanded competition to include another large defense company seeking a role as a shipbuilding prime contractor 

  

  

businessjet aircraft market 

  

competition in the businessjet aircraft market generally is divided into segments based on the cabin size range and price of the aircraft gulfstream offers a total of seven products described under products and services – aerospace the company has at least one competitor for each of its products the number of competitors increases for the shorterrange aircraft the key competitive factors in the businessjet market are the safety and performance characteristics of the aircraft the quality and timeliness of the service provided advances in technology innovative marketing programs and price the company believes that it competes favorably on these criteria 

  

  

customers 

  

the company’s primary customer is the us government particularly the department of defense in 2004 67 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government 16 percent were to us commercial customers 12 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 5 percent were to international commercial customers 

  

us government 

  

the company’s net sales to the us government were as follows 

  

   

   

the company’s us government sales are funded by customer budgets which operate on an octobertoseptember fiscal year in february of each year the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year in appropriations and authorization legislation once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies 

  

there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted because of congressional schedules negotiations over funding levels for programs or unforeseen world events which could in turn alter the funding for a program or contract second funding for multiyear contracts can be changed by future appropriations which could affect the timing of funds schedules and program content 

  

the company’s us government business is performed under both costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts the company’s contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are often costreimbursement arrangements under which the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and pays a predetermined fee the company’s production contracts are largely fixedprice in which the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount in 2004 costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 47 percent and 53 percent respectively of the company’s government business 

  

in practice costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts each present advantages and disadvantages costreimbursement contracts generally involve lower risk for the company and sometimes involve fee schedules that award the company increased payments for satisfying certain performance criteria however not all costs are recoverable under these types of contracts and the government has the right to object to costs which could increase the company’s risk fixedprice contracts generally offer greater profit potential if the company can complete the work for less than the contract amount however on fixedprice contracts the company is responsible for absorbing any cost overruns that might occur

management overview 

  

  

general dynamics designs develops manufactures and supports leadingedge technology products and services for missioncritical information systems and technologies land and expeditionary combat systems armaments and munitions shipbuilding and marine systems and business aviation the company’s primary customers are the us military other government organizations the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and industrial buyers it operates through four primary business groups – information systems and technology combat systems marine systems and aerospace – and a small resources group 

  

the company has two primary business markets – defense and business aviation the majority of the company’s revenues derive from contracts with the us military current us policy is to pursue the global war on terrorism encourage the spread of democratic institutions and significantly enhance homeland defense efforts us military doctrine provides that these diverse and demanding missions require us armed forces that are equipped and trained to prevail quickly in small and largescale conflicts around the world current policy also dictates that success will require the transformation of us forces so they are more strategically mobile operationally lethal and tactically survivable these endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the us department of defense since 2001 

  

for fiscal year 2005 the congress appropriated 403 billion for the department of defense a 30 percent increase in funding since 2001 this amount includes 148 billion for procurement and research and development rd activities an increase of 44 percent since 2001 procurement and rd budgets provide the majority of the company’s revenues their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support with previously approved and recently announced supplemental funding the congress is being asked to provide additional funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan bringing the department of defense’s total funding for fiscal year 2005 to over 500 billion approximately a 60 percent increase since 2001 over 16 percent of the supplemental 2005 spending will go toward additional procurement as currently requested by the president the us army will receive 9 billion of that request and the us marine corps will get 3 billion assuming the congress approves the president’s request for fiscal year 2006 the president has requested that the congress appropriate 420 billion for the department of defense a 4 percent increase over 2005 this includes 147 billion for procurement and rd overall while department of defense funding levels may change over time the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs to remain consistent for 2005 and 2006 

  

  

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 15 

the global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the us military many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with us and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations the company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales 

  

the aerospace group is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of businessjet aircraft and is a leader in the longrange and ultralongrange largecabin businessjet market as well as in the businessjet service and product support market the group’s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for businessaviation products by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and highnetworth individuals 

  

the businessaviation market improved considerably during 2004 with an increase in demand a reduction in aircraft inventory – both new and preowned – and a firming in pricing the increase in demand was across the aerospace group’s customer base reflecting the improved global economy and higher us corporate earnings the cost containment and efficiency initiatives that the company implemented in 2003 resulted in a marked increase in the group’s earnings and margins in 2004 the company expects that the businessaviation market will continue to improve and that the group will continue to benefit from that improvement and from its management and costreduction initiatives 

  

general dynamics’ management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements the company has proven itself over the past 10 years as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions payment of dividends and share repurchases 

  

consolidated overview 

  

results of operations 

  

general dynamics’ net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003 to 192 billion this growth resulted from increased volume across all of the company’s primary business groups and in part from acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat systems groups the information systems and technology group provided the most significant contribution to the sales growth in 2004 as a result of strong demand for its communications and information technology products and services the company’s 2004 performance followed sales growth of 20 percent in 2003 the company’s net sales increased to 164 billion in 2003 from 137 billion in 2002 this increase was driven by acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat systems groups and increased volume in the company’s defense businesses reduced in part by lower sales of new aircraft in the aerospace group 

  

in 2004 general dynamics’ focus on operations and program execution resulted in substantial improvement in the company’s earnings and operating margins over 2003 operating earnings increased 34 percent from 2003 double the rate of sales growth to 19 billion in 2004 all of the company’s major business units contributed to this performance the aerospace group improved its earnings significantly on effectively the same volume as 2003 the marine systems group experienced reduced losses in its commercial shipbuilding business compared with 2003 which also contributed to higher earnings in 2004 overall the company’s operating margins increased to 101 percent in 2004 from 88 percent in 2003 reflecting the increased demand for the company’s products and services the successful integration of businesses acquired in 2003 and improved processes that resulted in significant cost reductions 

  

operating earnings in 2003 decreased 8 percent from 2002 to 14 billion the impact of increased volume across the company and acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat

systems groups was offset by decreased earnings in the marine systems and aerospace groups earnings were down in those groups in 2003 due to performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts and reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures at gulfstream 

  

the company generated substantial cash flow from operating activities in 2004 and 2003 significantly exceeding net earnings in each year in 2002 cash flow from operating activities approximated net earnings net cash provided by operating activities was 18 billion in 2004 compared with 17 billion in 2003 and 11 billion in 2002 the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures repurchase its common stock pay dividends and reduce debt 

  

general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 62 percent in 2004 compared with 66 percent in 2003 and 65 percent in 2002 ga was 12 billion in 2004 11 billion in 2003 and 892 in 2002 

  

in 2004 the company had net expense from nonoperating items of 8 compared with income of 3 in 2003 in 2002 income from nonoperating items was 47 which included a 36 gain from the sale of certain assets of combat systems’ space propulsion operation net interest expense increased to 148 in 2004 from 98 in 2003 because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company’s issuance of additional debt in 2003 used to fund acquisitions net interest expense was 45 in 2002 

  

the company’s effective tax rate was 326 percent in 2004 273 percent in 2003 and 337 percent in 2002 the 2003 tax rate was lower than the other years because of the settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the internal revenue service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes these events resulted in noncash benefits in 2003 totaling 68 favorably impacting the company’s tax rate by 5 percent 

  

in 2004 general dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested as a result the company completed the sale of two businesses in 2004 and entered into definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses both of which closed in the first quarter of 2005 the company’s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses their earnings however are included as discontinued operations net of income taxes for all periods for additional discussion of these divestiture activities see note c to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the company exited its undersea fiberoptic cablelaying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog the results of this business’ operations in 2002 are included as discontinued operations net of income taxes the company recognized an aftertax loss of 134 including an aftertax charge of 109 for ship lease obligations and the writedown of assets to net realizable value upon disposal of this business 

  

  

general dynamics’ total backlog reached its highest level ever 421 billion and the funded backlog grew 14 percent over 2003 to 283 billion at december 31 2004 each of the company’s business groups experienced significant new order activity in 2004 resulting in total new orders of 196 billion during the year 

  

the total backlog for the company’s defense businesses was 35 billion at the end of 2004 up 11 billion over yearend 2003 the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog grew 14 percent in 2004 to 234 billion this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer as well as commitments by international customers that are also approved and funded by their governments the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated the backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts the total potential value of these contracts which may be realized over the next 10 years was approximately 64 billion as of december 31 2004 

  

the aerospace group’s total backlog at december 31 2004 was 68 billion an increase of 5 percent over 2003 perhaps more important the aerospace funded backlog which is an indicator of nearterm demand increased 13 percent in 2004 to 46 billion this growth reflects the increase in demand for new aircraft throughout the year that culminated in a record number of orders in the fourth quarter the funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the unfunded backlog of 22 billion at yearend 2004 consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 

  

the resources group’s backlog was 258 at yearend 2004 of which 200 was funded

review of operating segments 

  

information systems and technology 

  

results of operations and outlook 

  

   

the information systems and technology group’s sales and earnings increased significantly in 2004 compared with 2003 the group enjoyed growing demand in all of its markets – tactical and strategic mission systems intelligence mission systems and network infrastructure and information technology it services – including 

  

   

   

   

   

acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 were the other major driver of the sales growth contributing about half of the increase over 2003 

  

the group’s 2004 operating margins were down slightly from 2003 because of a change in the mix of program deliveries through the year and lowermargin businesses acquired in the second half of 2003 of note the group’s overall margins improved in 2004 over the fourth quarter of 2003 as it continued to integrate these businesses 

  

during 2004 the company completed two acquisitions in the group – spectrum astro inc in july and tripoint global communications inc in september these acquisitions enhance the group’s offerings in space vehicle integration and mobile communications 

  

the company expects the information systems and technology group to experience singledigit sales growth in 2005 operating margins should remain similar to average margins in 2004 though margins may fluctuate from period to period based on contract mix and timing of deliveries the group will continue to focus on operations and program performance and the integration of the businesses acquired in 2004 

  

   

in 2003 the group experienced significant sales and earnings growth over 2002 as a result of increased volume in several areas of the business including 

  

   

   

   

   

the acquisitions of veridian corporation and digital system resources inc in the third quarter of 2003 also contributed significantly to the sales and earnings growth though the lower margins associated with these businesses reduced the group’s overall operating margins as discussed above 

  

  

  

the information systems and technology group’s backlog grew to a record 94 billion in 2004 an increase of 26 percent over 2003 the group’s funded backlog representing over 75 percent of the total backlog increased by 12 billion in 2004 unlike the company’s other defense businesses the information systems and technology group’s backlog is made up primarily of a large number of midsize contracts and programs however 2004 saw an unusually high number of awards for largescale longterm programs in the defense market for communications and it products and services the group received many of these significant awards during the year leading to the substantial increase in backlog 

  

the army selected the information systems and technology group as the prime contractor for its wint program wint is the army’s key initiative designed to transform its tactical communications network from the current 

  

18 general dynamics 2004 annual report 

system to support the future force the entire wint program has a potential value of 7 billion through 2018 and work is expected to be shared evenly with the company’s principal subcontractor 

  

the group was also awarded “cluster 5” of the joint tactical radio system jtrs a contract worth 295 to develop small lightweight softwaredefined radios for use by all branches of the usmilitary in systems ranging from handhelds to unattended sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles the jtrs program is designed to transform joint service operations by providing communication flexibility and adaptability to fighting forces if all options are exercised the contract has a potential value of over 1 billion through 2011 

  

the group is part of a team that was selected by the us navy to build the mobile user objective system muos a narrowband tactical satellite communications system the information systems and technology group will lead the segments of the muos program that supply network management satellite control and a secure ground network as well as a jtrscompliant terminal solution the subcontract is valued at over 800 

  

the group is also a member of a team that was selected as canada’s maritime helicopter project mhp provider the mhp program calls for the replacement of canada’s aging fleet of marine helicopters with 28 stateoftheart helicopters to be used for antisubmarine patrols surveillance searchandrescue and disaster relief the company has been selected to provide the integrated mission systems for the new helicopters and related support for 20 years under a subcontract arrangement with a potential value of up to 13 billion 

  

the information systems and technology group was also awarded a fiveyear contract valued at approximately 480 to continue its support of the us joint forces command’s joint experimentation program and joint futures lab which develops new warfighting concepts organizational structures and emerging technologies the company has supported this program for the past six years providing services such as rd engineering and formulation and analysis of joint operational concepts 

  

the information systems and technology group’s backlog at the end of 2004 also includes several international programs reflecting the demand for its products and services overseas the group’s most significant international contract is the bowman program a secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces the group’s yearend backlog includes approximately 19 billion for the bowman program 

  

the group’s backlog does not include approximately 63 billion of potential contract value awarded under idiq contracts idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed these agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms including prices but are funded as delivery orders are placed a significant portion of this idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the solesource supplier over several years to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems however because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 

  

the company was awarded several significant idiq contracts during 2004 including one of four contracts under the air force’s networkcentric solutions netcents program under the netcents program the company will provide information technology networking and voice video and data communications products and services to support the air force’s global information requirements the multipleaward idiq program has a threeyear base period with two oneyear options and a potential value of 9 billion 

  

in addition the information systems and technology group was awarded one of 12 information technology systems support itss iii contracts by the us department of justice doj to provide stateoftheart it services and projectrelated hardware to doj organizations and other federal agencies this multipleaward idiq program has a performance period of seven years and a ceiling value of approximately 1 billion 

  

combat systems 

  

results of operations and outlook 

  

   

the combat systems group posted solid increases in net sales and operating earnings in 2004 compared with 2003 strengthened by acquisitions completed in 2003 the group’s volume increased in 2004 as demand for its products grew both in the united states and abroad in particular the group’s sales of armored vehicles in europe including leopard tanks ulan infantry fighting vehicles and piranha combat vehicles increased significantly in 2004 in addition the group experienced increased activity on its contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the army’s future combat systems fcs program and in its munitions and armaments businesses these gains were partially offset by lower volume on some combat vehicle production programs including fewer m1 abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements 

  

operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of the group’s sales growth in 2004 a shift in contract mix and improved performance on 

  

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 19 

a number of the group’s programs including fcs stryker and tactical air munitions contracts contributed to the strong earnings performance 

  

the company expects the combat systems group’s sales to increase significantly in 2005 based on the group’s solid backlog and opportunities for growth in the united states and internationally operating margins in 2005 should approximate those achieved in 2004 

  

   

in 2003 the combat systems group experienced substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings due largely to several acquisitions during the year in 2003 the company acquired general motors defense intercontinental manufacturing company and steyr daimler puch spezialfahrzeug aktiengesellschaft  company kg in addition increased activity on the leopard tank production program growing contributions to the army’s fcs program and solid performance in the company’s munitions and armaments businesses augmented the contributions of acquired businesses this growth was reduced in part by fewer m1 abrams main battle tank upgrades and reduced deliveries of the pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicle in spain 

  

  

the combat systems group’s total backlog increased in 2004 to 87 billion at year end the group’s funded backlog grew by 10 percent to reach 64 billion at the end of 2004 the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012 

  

the group’s backlog at year end includes approximately 790 for the production of stryker wheeled combat vehicles in 2004 combat systems received orders from the army for 328 vehicles valued at approximately 440 to complete the fourth stryker brigade the group also was awarded three delivery orders worth 206 for 95 additional stryker combat vehicles including the first production of the mobile gun system and nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance variants in the first quarter of 2005 the army ordered 423 additional vehicles valued at over 580 to equip the fifth stryker brigade the stryker program which currently calls for a total of six brigades by 2008 is a key component of the ongoing army transformation 

  

the army also awarded the combat systems group several contracts to extend the company’s m1 abrams main battle tank program the first was a delivery order valued at 121 under a contract to upgrade 65 m1a2 abrams tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement program sep configuration through this program the company retrofits m1a2 tanks with improved electronics commandandcontrol capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank’s effectiveness in january 2005 the army awarded the company a modification worth 161 to upgrade an additional 64 m1a2 abrams tanks during 2004 the company was also awarded a 52 delivery order for 120 m1a1 abrams integrated management aim material sets to be delivered by june 2006 in addition the company was awarded a contract modification valued at 267 to provide 125 m1a1 hardware kits for the egyptian coproduction program 

  

another significant award for the combat systems group in 2004 was a 25 delivery order initiating a contract for the production of joint biological point detection systems jbpds the jbpds is a selfpowered instrument suite that rapidly detects and identifies biological warfare agents such as airborne viruses bacteria and toxins this contract has a potential value of 750 for approximately 1100 systems through 2009 if all options are exercised 

  

internationally in 2004 the government of portugal conducted a competition for armored vehicles and in december selected the group’s pandur ii vehicle and funded the program a contract valued at over 475 to produce 260 armored combat vehicles was finalized and added to the backlog in the first quarter of 2005 

  

in addition to the 2004 contract awards discussed above combat systems’ backlog at year end includes several significant ongoing programs the group is contributing to the army’s fcs program through the development of manned ground vehicles and the autonomous navigation system for unmanned and manned ground vehicles the group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes 18 billion for this aspect of the fcs program the information systems and technology group is also participating in this program providing the integrated computer system sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services 

  

the fcs program has been restructured to deliver newly developed technologies to existing forces as soon as they are available rather than waiting until all planned technology innovations are complete with this acceleration of new technologies the army plans to focus on networking capabilities unattended munitions unmanned systems and manned ground vehicles 

  

20 general dynamics 2004 annual report 

the combat systems group’s leopard program is a longterm battle tank manufacturing contract for the spanish army under license from a german company the yearend backlog includes 12 billion for the production of 232 leopard tanks with deliveries scheduled through 2008 the group also produces pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicles for the spanish army the group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes over 850 for the production of 212 pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012 

  

another key program in the combat systems group is the marine corps’ expeditionary fighting vehicle efv contract in 2004 the company was awarded a contract modification to continue the system development and demonstration phase of the efv program which deferred the beginning of lowrate initial production from 2005 to 2006 the group’s backlog at yearend 2004 includes approximately 470 for this effort program production which currently calls for over 1000 vehicles is scheduled to begin in 2006 and continue into 2020 

  

the combat systems yearend 2004 backlog also includes over 12 billion in armament munitions and composite structures programs the ammunition programs include the production of hydra70 70mm rockets motors and warheads in 2004 the group received orders worth approximately 125 from the usarmy aviation and missile command for the hydra70 program these orders extended deliveries through 2006 and brought the total contract value to date to 960 also in 2004 the usarmy joint munitions command awarded the group 110 worth of modifications to a contract for the production of mk80 series bomb bodies the contract has a total potential value of 240 and deliveries are scheduled through 2005 

  

  

marine systems 

  

  

results of operations and outlook 

  

   

in 2004 the marine systems group’s net sales grew as a result of higher activity on engineering and repair contracts and several earlystage production and development programs including the take combatlogistics ships the conversion of trident ballistic missile submarines to a conventionalstrike configuration ssgn and the virginiaclass submarine program the growth in sales was partially reduced by lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature production programs including the delivery of the final seawolfclass submarine 

  

the group’s operating earnings and margins improved significantly in 2004 compared with 2003 because of improved results on the company’s commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003 the company experienced losses in the first quarter of 2003 on the construction of two rollonrolloff cargo ships the two ships were delivered later in the year with no additional write offs later in 2003 the group recorded losses on the first of four doublehull oil tankers the losses totaled 70 and were the result of labor hour and material cost growth the company’s estimates to complete the tankers remained firm through the first half of 2004 however after the first ship was delivered in the third quarter of 2004 the company identified additional performance problems related to schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties as a result the company recorded additional losses on the contract of 43 in the second half of 2004 the second and third doublehull tankers are scheduled for delivery in 2005 with the fourth to be delivered in 2006 management continues to monitor the program closely in order to mitigate the risk of further cost growth 

  

the company expects the marine systems group’s sales in 2005 to approximate the group’s results in 2004 with slightly improved margins assuming no further deterioration on the commercial tanker contract 

  

   

in 2003 the marine systems group’s net sales increased over 2002 from increased activity on a number of design and earlystage production contracts including the virginiaclass ssgn and take programs as well as growth in engineering and repair work this growth was offset partially by lower activity on several mature ship construction programs earnings and margins declined in 2003 as a result of the performance issues on the two commercial shipbuilding programs discussed above 

  

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 21 

the marine systems group’s backlog at the end of 2004 was 168 billion consisting of numerous longterm submarine and ship construction programs along with repair and engineering contracts the group’s funded backlog grew by 11 billion or 13 percent in 2004 reaching 99 billion at year end this backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014 while the navy’s future shipbuilding plan fluctuates over time the group’s current shipbuilding and submarine programs are wellfunded through the next several years 

  

the group’s most significant contract in backlog is the virginiaclass submarine construction program the company has nine virginiaclass submarines under contract following the delivery of the lead ship in the class the virginia  in october 2004 at yearend 2004 the group’s backlog includes 91 billion for the construction of these submarines the current navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year the company is the prime contractor on this program and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner 

  

the group’s backlog at the end of 2004 includes 34 billion for 10 arleigh burkeclass ddg destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010 this includes 489 in funding awarded to the company in 2004 in january 2005 the navy awarded the company an additional 562 which funded the final destroyer under contract in the ddg program 

  

during 2004 the navy exercised options worth approximately 580 for the fifth and sixth ships in the take program a new class of combatlogistics ships the group’s backlog includes 15 billion at year end for the construction of the first six ships with deliveries scheduled from 2006 through 2008 in january 2005 the navy exercised additional options worth approximately 590 for two more ships bringing the total contract value to 25 billion the contract has options for four more ships for a total potential contract value of 37 billion 

  

the group also received approximately 390 in contract modifications from the navy in 2004 to provide design engineering material and logistics support for strategic and attack submarines rd for submarine research vehicles and planning scheduling and technical support for submarine maintenance activities these awards modify a 32 contract awarded in march 2004 that has a potential value of 11 billion over five years if all options are exercised 

  

in 2004 the group received 165 in modifications to its contract to convert four trident ballisticmissile submarines to an ssgn configuration a multimission submarine optimized for conventional tactical strike and specialoperations support these awards modify a contract that the navy awarded to the marine systems group in 2002 and bring the total program value to over 1 billion in january 2005 the navy awarded the group an additional 150 contract modification to continue the conversion 

  

the marine systems group leads one of two teams selected for the final stage of development for the littoral combat ship lcs the navy’s newest class of highspeed surface combatants designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats high speed swarm boats mines and diesel submarines in 2004 the navy awarded the group an option worth 79 to continue development of its proposed design for the lcs 

  

  

aerospace 

  

  

results of operations and outlook 

  

   

  

the aerospace group’s sales increased slightly in 2004 compared with 2003 new aircraft deliveries and aircraft services activity were up while preowned aircraft sales were lower the group’s earnings and margins in 2004 grew considerably over 2003 this increase resulted from three factors 

  

  

   

   

   

in 2003 the company initiated a series of costcontainment efforts and process improvements in response to declining market conditions and an oversupply of aircraft in the businessjet market these steps removed significant costs from the group’s new aircraft manufacturing process in addition the company implemented a more disciplined approach to preowned aircraft activity as a result sales of preowned aircraft in 2004 resulted in earnings of 6 compared with losses of 64 in 2003 these factors combined with the increased volume and improved mix of aircraft deliveries resulted in the significant rise in earnings and margins for the group in 2004 

  

businessjet market conditions improved significantly in 2004 demand for new aircraft increased steadily throughout the year and there was a marked improvement in pricing in the order activity late in the year the group finished 2004 with a record number of orders in the fourth quarter and for the full year excluding orders from fractional fleet customers with the 2005 production schedule substantially sold out the company expects moderate sales growth in the aerospace group in 2005 with improving operating margins 

  

22 general dynamics 2004 annual report 

   

net sales and operating earnings decreased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of deterioration in the businessjet market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003 lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and preowned aircraft for sale in the market resulted in downward pricing pressures these factors lowered the group’s sales and caused earnings and margins to decline in 2003 

  

summary of aircraft statistical information 

  

sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics the company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

  

the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group’s orders and backlog 

  

   

    

  

  

  

the aerospace group’s backlog reached 68 billion at yearend 2004 approximately 70 percent of the group’s backlog or 46 billion was funded at year end in 2004 the group received the largest number of new aircraft orders in the company’s history excluding orders from fractional fleet customers the backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2011 a significant portion of the group’s backlog is with netjets inc netjets a unit of berkshire hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market the group’s funded backlog at year end includes 19 billion with netjets representing firm contracts for 107 aircraft including 12 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2005 the unfunded backlog includes 14 billion for 100 aircraft options from netjets constituting all of the options in backlog netjets also represents 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from 2005 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 12 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years 

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 23 

the group’s remaining 27 billion of funded backlog at yearend 2004 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and includes approximately 400 of contracts with government customers 

  

  

resources 

  

  

the company’s resources group principally consists of two businesses a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry 

  

results of operations 

  

   

net sales in 2004 were down compared with 2003 as a result of decreased volume in the coal business offset in part by a slight increase in activity in the aggregates business the group’s 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company’s coal mining operations 

  

   

net sales in 2003 decreased versus 2002 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions the 2003 operating earnings were down from 2002 due to the volume decline and reduced earnings in the company’s commercial pension plan in addition the 2002 earnings were favorably impacted by the resolution of contingency reserves that had previously been established due to an improved longterm outlook for some of the coal operation’s contracts 

  

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

  

in the mid1990s general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment focusing on strong cash flow generation to enable a series of strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base since 1995 the company has acquired 37 businesses at a total cost of over 135 billion this has resulted in a larger more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility 

  

in 2004 the company continued its strong performance of cash generation with net cash provided by operating activities far surpassing net earnings for the second year in a row the company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions continue its trend of annual dividend increases and pay down debt to further enhance an already strong balance sheet the company ended 2004 with a cash balance of 976 total debt of 33 billion and a debttocapital ratio of 314 percent 

  

free cash flow from operations totaled 15 billion for both 2004 and 2003 compared with 860 in 2002 management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions and paying dividends the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

   

as discussed above the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally make acquisitions pay dividends and repurchase the company’s shares in the open market with free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2005 the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short and longterm liquidity needs management believes that the company has adequate funds on

the company generated strong cash flow from operating activities in 2004 net cash provided by operating activities was 18 billion in 2004 17 billion in 2003 and 11 billion in 2002 in each year net earnings was the primary driver of the company’s cash flow in 2004 cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings primarily due to taxes paid being lower than the tax provision in 2003 the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and preowned aircraft inventory in the aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year in 2002 cash provided by operating activities approximated net earnings 

  

termination of a12 program as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to the company’s expectations the default termination is ultimately sustained the company and the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 11 billion at december 31 2004 in this outcome the government contends the company’s liability would be approximately 12 billion pretax or 700 aftertax the company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation if required while still retaining ample liquidity

application of critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application 

  

revenue recognition – government contracts the company accounts for sales and earnings under longterm defense contracts and programs using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts including ga expenses 

  

the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg costs incurred or output eg units delivered measures as appropriate to the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed availability of materials the impact of delayed performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 

  

business aircraft the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position 811 these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 

  

the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 

  

preowned aircraft inventories in connection with orders for new aircraft the company routinely offers customers tradein options under these options if exercised the company will accept tradein aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value it is the company’s policy to limit its investment in preowned aircraft inventory at any point in time to 200 unless specifically authorized once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft the company records preowned aircraft at the lower of tradein value or estimated net realizable value the company treats any excess of the tradein price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of preowned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors including current market conditions future market conditions the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment gross margins on sales of preowned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 

  

general dynamics 2004 annual report 27 

commitments and contingencies the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 

  

deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments retirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid in accordance with aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business including both existing backlog and probable followon contracts this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 

  

pension plans the company makes assumptions about discount rates and longterm rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions these estimates are based on the company’s best judgment including consideration of both current and future market conditions the company considers both internal and external evidence to determine the appropriate assumptions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension cost as determined under sfas 87 could increase or decrease if the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 in 2004 likewise had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately 1 in 2004 the company’s contractual arrangements with the usgovernment provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans in accordance with aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of federal government contractors the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 

  

management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

  

  

new accounting standards 

  

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123r sfas 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value sfas 123r is effective in the third quarter of 2005 the company expects the adoption of sfas 123r to reduce its net earnings by approximately 15 in 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

  

the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate longterm debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments as of december 31 2004 the company had no shortterm investments fixedrate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company’s fixedrate debt a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in market interest rates applicable to the company’s commercial paper balances would not have a material effect on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  

the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2004 no interest rate swap agreements were in effect 

  

the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers longterm debt and certain intercompany transactions in foreign currencies the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreigndenominated payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2004 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of 14 pretax and an incremental unrealized loss of 56 pretax consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged when taken together these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk

a nautical miles b scheduled to enter service in 2004 c scheduled to enter service in 2005 d scheduled to enter service in 2006 the company has at least one competitor in each market segment in which it competes the number of competitors increases in the segments that offer shorter ranges the key competitive factors in the businessjet market are the performance characteristics of the aircraft the quality and timeliness of the service provided the advances in technology offered and innovative marketing programs including price the company believes it competes favorably on these criteria customers the company’s primary customer is the us government particularly the department of defense in 2003 66 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government 18 percent were to us commercial customers 11 percent were directly to international defense customers and the remaining 5 percent were to international commercial customers  

us government the company’s net sales to the us government were as follows  

 the company’s us government sales are funded by customer budgets which operate on an october to september fiscal year in february of each year the president presents the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch from february through september of each year the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year in appropriations and authorization legislation once these levels are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies there are two primary risks associated with this process first the process may be delayed or disrupted as a result of congressional schedules negotiations over funding levels among government programs or unforeseen world events potentially interrupting the funding for a contract second some contracts that span several years are funded annually subjecting them to potential schedule and content changes year to year and increasing the challenges faced by program managers the company’s us government business is performed under both costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts the company’s contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are often costreimbursement arrangements under which the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and pays a predetermined fee the company’s production contracts are largely fixedprice in which the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount in 2003 costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 47 percent and 53 percent respectively of the company’s government business costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts each present advantages and disadvantages for the company costreimbursement contracts generally involve lower risk for the company and sometimes involve fee schedules that award the company increased payments for satisfying certain performance criteria however not all of the company’s costs are recoverable under these types of contracts and the government has the right to object to the company’s costs which can increase the company’s risk fixedprice contracts generally offer greater profit potential if the company can complete the work for less than the contract amount however fixedprice contracts put the company at risk for absorbing any cost overruns us commercial the company’s commercial sales were 3009 in 2003 3235 in 2002 and 3555 in 2001 these sales represented approximately 18 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2003 23 percent in 2002 and 29 percent in 2001 the majority of these sales were for gulfstream aircraft primarily to fortune 500 ® companies and large privately held companies the aircraft are operated by customers in a wide range of industries international the company’s direct nonforeign military sales sales to defense and commercial customers outside the united states were 2581 in 2003 1788 in 2002 and 1180 in 2001 these sales represented approximately 16 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2003 13 percent in 2002 and 10 percent in 2001 international defense sales were primarily from the company’s subsidiaries located abroad international commercial sales were primarily exports of businessjet aircraft the company has operations in australia austria canada germany spain switzerland and the united kingdom sales from these international operations were 2175 in 2003 970 in 2002 and 421 in 2001 the longlived assets of operations located outside the united states were 16 percent of the company’s total as of december 31 2003 6 percent as of december 31 2002 and 5 percent as of december 31 2001 for information regarding sales by geographic region see note r to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k suppliers in some cases the company is dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components used in the production of its products in some instances the company relies on only one or two  

sources of supply a disruption in deliveries from its suppliers therefore could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to meet its commitments to customers however the company has not experienced and does not foresee any difficulty in obtaining the materials components or supplies necessary for its business operations research and development the company conducts independent research and development rd activities the company also conducts rd activities under us government contracts to develop products for large systemsdevelopment and technology programs the majority of companysponsored rd expenditures in each of the past three years was in the company’s defense business the company recovers a significant portion of these expenditures through overhead charges pursuant to us government contracts the rd activities of the aerospace group consist primarily of internally funded product enhancement and development programs for gulfstream aircraft research and development expenditures were as follows

terminated in whole or in part at the government’s convenience or for default if a contract is terminated for convenience of the government a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and in general the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done if a contract is terminated for default the government generally pays for only the work it has accepted these regulations also subject the company to financial audits and other reviews by the government of its costs performance accounting and general business practices relating to its contracts which may result in adjustment of the company’s contractrelated costs and fees in addition failure by the company to comply with procurement laws or regulations can result in civil criminal or

maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of the company’s operations these costs are not significant relative to total operating costs or cash flows and often are allowable costs under the company’s contracts with the us government these costs have not been material in the past based on information currently available to the company and current us government policies relating to allowable costs the company does not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows a potentially responsible party prp has joint and several liability under existing us environmental laws where the company has been designated a prp by the environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency it is potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at the company’s facilities

the aerospace group is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of businessjet aircraft and is a leader in the longrange and ultralongrange largecabin businessjet market the company’s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for businessaviation products by us and foreign businesses the us and other governments and highnetworth individuals business aviation was affected by the global economic slowdown in recent years during that time the company pursued aggressive management initiatives to improve efficiency and introduced new products that expanded the markets served by its aircraft the company anticipates an improved environment as the global economy shows signs of recovery and the businessjet aircraft market stabilizes the company will continue to implement improved business processes to take full advantage of these conditions the company’s management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements the company has proven itself as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions and share repurchases consolidated overview results of operations the company’s net sales were 166 billion in 2003 up 20 percent over 2002 acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems and strong organic growth in the company’s defense businesses contributed to the sales growth offset in part by reduced sales of new aircraft in aerospace the overall organic growth in 2003 was 8 percent led by 20 percent organic growth in information systems and technology growth from acquisitions in 2003 was 12 percent in 2002 net sales increased by 15 percent over 2001 on strong volume in information systems and technology and combat systems as well as contributions from acquired businesses about half of the sales growth in 2002 was organic net earnings grew more than 9 percent from 2002 to just over 1 billion in 2003 this increase resulted from both organic growth and acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems but was offset partially by decreased earnings in marine systems and aerospace the downward pressure on 2003 earnings from marine systems was driven by performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts aerospace 2003 earnings were lower because of reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures particularly in the first half of the year however management is cautiously optimistic that the businessaviation market has stabilized for 2002 the company’s net earnings were essentially flat compared with 2001 because of an aftertax charge of 134 reported as discontinued operations that was associated with the company’s exit from its undersea fiberoptic cablelaying business the company generated significant cash flow from operating activities in 2003 through strong operating results and diligent management of working capital including sharply reduced levels of preowned aircraft inventory net cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in 2003 compared with 11 billion in 2002 and 2001 the company used its cash to pay down debt as reflected in an increase in net debt of only 21 billion during the year despite making acquisitions in excess of 3 billion the company also used the funds to repurchase its common shares pay dividends and fund capital expenditures in 2002 and 2001 cash from operating activities approximated net income general and administrative ga expenses as a percentage of sales have remained consistent year over year at around 65 percent ga was 11 billion in 2003 903 in 2002 and 808 in 2001 income from nonoperating items was 3 in 2003 compared with 47 in 2002 which included a 36 gain from the sale of some assets of the space propulsion operation within combat systems in 2001 expense  

from nonoperating items was 5 net interest expense increased to 98 in 2003 from 45 in 2002 the result of a higher average borrowing balance from the company’s issuance of additional debt to fund acquisitions net interest expense was 56 in 2001 the company’s effective tax rate was 273 percent in 2003 336 percent in 2002 and 338 percent in 2001 the 2003 tax rate was lower than in previous years because of a settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the internal revenue service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes these events resulted in noncash benefits totaling 68 favorably impacting the company’s tax rate by 5 percent as noted above the company exited its undersea fiberoptic cablelaying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog the results of this business’ operations are included as discontinued operations net of income taxes for all periods presented the company recognized an aftertax gain of 7 in 2003 upon the favorable resolution of certain liabilities related to this business in 2002 the company recognized an aftertax loss of 134 including an aftertax charge of 109 for ship lease obligations and the writedown of assets to net realizable value in 2001 the cablelaying business operated at a breakeven level operating results from this business had been included in the information systems and technology group since 1998 backlog the company’s total backlog increased 42 percent over 2002 to 411 billion at yearend 2003 this growth resulted from substantial new order activity in all business groups and acquisitions in information systems and technology and combat systems new orders received during 2003 totaled 25 billion including an 84 billion submarine order in the marine systems group the company’s funded backlog grew 18 percent over 2002 to 253 billion at the end of 2003 the company’s defense businesses contributed 343 billion to the 2003 yearend total backlog an increase of 57 percent over 2002 this portion of the total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts the funded portion of this backlog increased to 21 billion in 2003 and includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by congress and funded by the customer the unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated the backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts the total potential value of these contracts was approximately 67 billion as of december 31 2003 up from 3 billion at the end of 2002 and may be realized over the next 10 years the aerospace group’s total backlog of 65 billion remained steady in 2003 despite adverse economic conditions in the businessjet market in late 2002 and the first half of 2003 the aerospace funded backlog was 41 billion at the end of 2003 and includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer the unfunded backlog which consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services was 24 billion at yearend 2003 up slightly from 2002 the resources group’s backlog was 220 as of yearend 2003 of which 163 was funded review of operating segments information systems and technology results of operations and outlook  

the information systems and technology group experienced strong net sales and operating earnings growth in 2003 from substantial organic growth and the addition of several new businesses volume increased in 2003 across all of the group’s operations reflecting the growing importance of digital networkcentric c4isr and informationsharing technologies in the defense and intelligence communities this growth included increases in      

the group’s overall operating margin decreased slightly in 2003 as a result of lower margins in the businesses acquired during the year and because earnings in 2002 included the favorable resolution of some commercial program exposures during 2003 the company completed three acquisitions in the group — creative technology incorporated in march veridian corporation in august and digital system resources inc in september the company believes these acquisitions strengthen its product mix and service offerings and expand its customer base within the intelligence and defense agencies of the us government also during 2003 the company combined two business units into a new business unit general dynamics c4 systems the company believes the combination of these two operations will enhance its competitive position and enable it to more efficiently serve its customers the combined business unit provides systemsintegration capabilities in the areas of tactical networks information assurance command and control space products and systems and military radios for 2004 the company expects continued strong revenue and earnings growth in the information systems and technology group driven by the 2003 acquisitions the group’s expanding customer base and the continued fielding of growing programs such as bowman and the coast guard’s rescue 21 searchandrescue system the company anticipates a modest decrease in operating margins as it continues to integrate the newly acquired businesses and as new awards change the group’s contract mix  

in 2002 net sales and operating earnings were up considerably over 2001 the increases resulted from organic growth in core government programs such as the bowman program and the acquisition of integrated information systems group iisg from motorola inc in september 2001 operating margins in 2002 were significantly higher than historical averages due to a shift in the group’s product mix including accelerated deliveries of encryption products the acquisition of decision systems the reduction of commercial program exposures discussed above and the elimination of goodwill amortization upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” backlog the information systems and technology group’s backlog increased 24 billion in 2003 to 77 billion at year end from both acquisitions and new order activity over 80 percent of the group’s backlog at year end was funded in contrast with the company’s other defense businesses information systems and technology’s backlog consists of a large number of relatively small dollarvalue contracts and programs these include programs that support the us government’s military transformation homeland security initiatives and overseas programs that underscore the growing international market for the company’s products and services the group’s backlog does not include approximately 65 billion of potential contract value awarded under idiq contracts a significant portion of this idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the solesource supplier over several years to design develop produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems however because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer’s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded in 2003 the company received two significant awards that extend two of the group’s longestrunning programs the army awarded the company the common hardwaresoftware iii chs3 contract to provide continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers network hardware equipment power subsystems peripheral devices and commercial software to the army marine corps air force and other federal agencies worldwide this idiq contract which has a potential value of 2 billion over its 10year life is a followon to the company’s chs2 contract now entering its tenth year in addition the air force selected the company for an idiq contract called intelligence information commandandcontrol equipment and enhancements ice2 to support and maintain critical intelligence and commandandcontrol systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide the contract which extends a program that  

the company has been operating for over 25 years has a fouryear base term with two threeyear options and a total potential value of 2 billion the company won several other notable awards during the year including contracts to develop and demonstrate several aspects of the army’s future combat systems fcs program the fcs program which is central to the army’s transformation initiative is a family of advanced networked air and groundbased systems the information systems and technology group was selected to provide the integrated computer system sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services for fcs the combined value of these information systems and technology awards is in excess of 350 over the next five years with potential for followon production activity combat systems is performing additional work on the fcs program the army also selected the company to develop produce and integrate the land warrior soldier system this program provides the individual soldier with personal electronics communications global navigation and other integrated equipment designed to increase awareness lethality and survivability the army plans to fully integrate this system with the stryker brigade combat teams and the fcs program including options the land warrior program has a potential value of approximately 790 over the next seven years the army awarded the company a contract with a potential value of approximately 300 over 10 years to integrate a voice and data communications system called the secure enroute communications package — improved secompi this system is designed to enable joint tactical forces to arrive at their deployment destinations fully briefed on the most current intelligence reports and plan updates available combat systems results of operations and outlook  

the combat systems group’s net sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2003 primarily due to a series of acquisitions during the year that broadened the company’s product base opened new markets and further aligned the company with department of defense transformational initiatives the growth from acquisitions was augmented by steady organic growth in sales and operating earnings including increased volume in the leopard tank production program in spain growing contributions to the army’s fcs program and strong performance in the company’s munitions and armaments operations this growth was offset slightly by fewer abrams main battle tank upgrades reduced deliveries of the pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicle in spain and the 2002 termination of the crusader program during 2003 the company completed three acquisitions in the group — general motors defense gm defense in march intercontinental manufacturing company in september and steyr daimler puch spezialfahrzeug aktiengesellschaft  company kg steyr in october the acquisition of gm defense included mowag a combat vehicle operation based in switzerland with the addition of mowag and steyr to the company’s existing combat vehicle presence in spain the company created a new business unit called general dynamics european land combat systems based in vienna austria the company believes the consolidation of these businesses under common management positions the combat systems group to strengthen its market base better serve its customers and more competitively pursue land combat systems opportunities around the world the company believes the combat systems group with its broad and diverse base of product offerings and substantial backlog is well positioned for solid growth in 2004 and beyond accordingly management expects strong revenue and earnings growth for the group in 2004 with operating margins consistent with 2003  

for 2002 organic growth was the primary driver of the significant increases in net sales and operating earnings in the combat systems group this growth was fueled by increased production on the first brigade of the stryker program increased deliveries on the leopard program higher volume on various munitions programs and additional development work on the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv formerly the advanced amphibious assault vehicle the acquisition of advanced technical products inc in june 2002 also contributed to the net sales and operating earnings growth in 2002  

backlog the combat systems group’s total backlog rose 71 percent in 2003 to 85 billion at year end because of acquisitions and new order activity including several significant contract awards the group’s funded backlog also grew significantly from 42 billion in 2002 to 6 billion at the end of 2003 the group’s backlog consists primarily of longterm production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012 during 2003 combat systems won several contracts to partner with the us military as it transforms its forces for the future the company received an order from the army for the third of six brigades of stryker wheeled combat vehicles a key component of the army’s transformation to a lighter more mobile force the order for 267 vehicles is valued at 384 and is scheduled for delivery in 2004 the yearend backlog included 566 for the production of stryker vehicles congress appropriated funding in 2004 for the fourth brigade and the 2005 budget request includes funding for the fifth brigade the first brigade of stryker vehicles is deployed in operation iraqi freedom with the acquisition of gm defense the company has consolidated its lead role on the 4 billion stryker program which calls for a total of 2096 vehicles for six planned brigades the company believes there is significant potential for international sales of these vehicles in addition the group and its teaming partner were selected to develop and demonstrate portions of the army’s fcs program the contracts awarded to the combat systems group in 2003 have a value of 22 billion and include engineering development and demonstration of a family of eight manned ground vehicles as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for unmanned and manned ground vehicles these ground vehicles are intended to be the new generation of army combat vehicles the army also awarded combat systems the lead technology integration contract for the second phase of its future force warrior ffw advanced technology demonstration program the 100 award is for completion of detailed designs of the ffw networkcentric soldier system part of the army’s plan to create a highly networked lethal survivable soldier of the future the system development and demonstration phase of this program has a potential value of 1 to 3 billion over a 10year period the combat systems backlog also included approximately 380 for the continued design and development of the marine corps’ efv program seven out of nine new infantry carrier prototypes as well as a commandandcontrol prototype have been completed as of yearend 2003 initial production of more than 1000 vehicles is scheduled to begin in 2006 the company received additional funding to upgrade m1a2 abrams battle tanks to the m1a2 system enhancement package sep configuration through this program the company retrofits m1a2 tanks with improved electronics commandandcontrol capabilities and armor enhancements that improve the tank’s effectiveness the administration’s 2005 budget request includes funding for more m1a2 sep upgrades in addition the company was awarded a contract modification in 2003 to provide 125 m1a1 hardware kits for the egyptian tank coproduction program bringing the total program which began in 1992 to 880 m1a1 tank kits the combat systems group’s leopard program is a longterm battle tank manufacturing contract for the spanish army under license from a german company the yearend backlog included 14 billion for the production of 232 leopard tanks with deliveries scheduled through 2008 the company also produces pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicles for the spanish army the spanish government awarded the company a contract valued at 640 for the second phase of the pizarro program bringing the total program value to almost 900 with deliveries of 212 vehicles scheduled through 2012 combat systems’ backlog at yearend 2003 included approximately 12 billion in armament munitions and composite structures programs such as reactive armor for the bradley fighting vehicle and various trainable gunmount systems the ammunition programs include a 200 order from the army in 2003 for rockets motors and warheads for the hydra70 70mm rocket system which raised the program value to date to over 800 and extended deliveries through 2006 the army also awarded the company a contract to add a precision guidance system to the 70mm rocket family as part of the development of the nextgeneration advanced precision kill weapon system apkws the composite structures programs include work on numerous aerospace platforms including the f16 f18 f22 c17 joint strike fighter and unmanned aerial vehicles such as the global hawk and the predator  

marine systems results of operations and outlook  

the marine systems group’s net sales grew in 2003 from increases in volume across the group including contracts for design and earlystage production on the virginiaclass submarine conversion of trident submarines ssgn and design and production of take combat logistics ships commercial shipbuilding engineering and repair volume also rose during the year these increases were offset partially by lower volume on several mature production programs including the seawolfclass submarine program operating earnings and margins for the marine systems group declined in 2003 because of performance problems on two commercial shipbuilding contracts in the first quarter of the year earnings were affected by problems first encountered in 2002 in the construction of two rollonrolloff cargo ships for totem ocean trailer express inc tote after the first quarter there was no further erosion in this program the two tote ships under contract have been delivered to the customer in the latter part of the year the group experienced problems during the construction of the first ship of a contract to produce four doublehull oil tankers management evaluated the program’s performance and the estimates to complete the four ships and recognized losses totaling approximately 70 on the contract the first ship was in the water in the fourth quarter of 2003 and was approximately 90 percent complete at year end although the company does not expect any additional charges associated with these ships management will continue to monitor the program closely the first two ships are scheduled to be delivered in 2004 the third in 2005 and the fourth in 2006 the company expects revenue growth in the marine systems group in 2004 as the group executes its substantial backlog based on this large backlog of steady longterm production programs and management’s current belief that the group has turned the corner on its commercial shipbuilding problems the company expects marine systems’ operating margins to improve steadily in 2004 other significant events expected in 2004 include the may 30 expiration of a collective bargaining agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union at bath iron works which represents approximately 65 percent of its work force  

in 2002 marine systems’ net sales were flat and operating earnings were down slightly from 2001 new commercial ship design work and an increase in volume on the virginiaclass submarine program were offset by lower volume on mature production programs this shift in the group’s contract mix along with the problems on the tote program discussed above caused earnings and operating margins to decrease in 2002 backlog the marine systems group’s backlog grew remarkably in 2003 as a result of several significant contract awards at the end of 2003 the group’s backlog reached an alltime high of 182 billion a 56 percent increase over 2002 the backlog consists of numerous longterm submarine and ship construction programs as well as repair and engineering contracts the navy’s shipbuilding plan will continue to have a significant influence on marine systems’ backlog in 2003 the navy awarded the company an 87 billion contract for the construction of the next six virginiaclass submarines the largest submarine order in us history the contract authorizes construction of one ship per year from 2003 through 2008 in january 2004 the five ships planned for construction from 2004 through 2008 became part of a multiyear agreement saving the customer approximately 300 and shifting 15 billion from unfunded to funded backlog in 1998 the navy had awarded the company a contract to build the first four virginiaclass submarines of this potential 30ship program the marine systems group’s backlog at year end included 17 billion associated with these first four submarines with one submarine scheduled to be delivered each year from 2004 through 2007 the lead ship in the class the virginia  was christened in august 2003 the company is the prime contractor on this program and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner  

the company received 310 in modifications to its contract to convert four ohioclass trident ballisticmissile submarines to an ssgn configuration a multimission submarine optimized for tactical strike and specialoperations support these modifications are part of a 443 contract that the navy awarded to marine systems in 2002 for the design and related support of this conversion program in addition the navy awarded the information systems and technology group over 100 in contracts in 2003 to support the ssgn conversion in 2003 the navy awarded the company a 953 contract modification to provide funding for the next two arleigh burkeclass ddg destroyers part of a sevenship award received in september 2002 at the end of 2003 the group’s backlog included 12 ddgs scheduled for delivery through 2010 the 2005 defense budget includes two ddgs an international team led by the marine systems group was one of three contractors that received contracts in 2003 to develop preliminary designs for the navy’s littoral combat ship lcs the lcs is an integrated surface combatant intended to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats highspeed swarm boats mines and diesel submarines the navy plans to award construction contracts in 2004 to two of the three remaining competitors for two ships each the first ship delivery is scheduled in 2007 in 2003 the navy exercised an option to build a fourth take ship a new class of combat logistics ships this option is valued at approximately 290 and is part of a potential 12ship contract awarded to the company in 2001 the backlog included 11 billion at year end for the construction of the first four ships which are scheduled to be delivered between 2005 and 2007 in january 2004 the navy exercised options worth approximately 580 for the fifth and sixth take ships the contract has options for six more ships over the next five years for a total potential contract value of approximately 37 billion aerospace results of operations and outlook  

the aerospace group’s sales and earnings were 2946 and 218 respectively for 2003 down from the previous year the group’s performance was affected by a deterioration in the business aviation market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003 the deterioration was driven primarily by lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and preowned aircraft in particular the oversupply of relatively new preowned aircraft available for sale in the market put additional pricing pressure on both new and preowned aircraft these conditions lowered sales and put downward pressure on margins in response the company took a series of actions including cost reductions layoffs and process improvements to reduce costs and improve profitability on an ongoing basis the company expects to realize significant annual expense savings beginning in 2004 as a result of these actions market conditions appeared to improve during the second half of 2003 and the company is cautiously optimistic that the outlook for the aerospace group is improving the group experienced quarteroverquarter sales and earnings growth beginning in the second quarter of 2003 and new aircraft manufacturing margins improved steadily throughout the year preowned and new aircraft inventories at year end declined considerably from 2002 and losses associated with preowned aircraft activity were all but eliminated by the fourth quarter resulting in fewer losses in preowned aircraft for the full year 2003 64 than in 2002 81 orders for new aircraft increased each quarter during the year and reached record levels in the fourth quarter of 2003 market data also indicate that prices are stabilizing on both new and preowned aircraft the company expects improved earnings and operating margins in the aerospace group on slightly higher deliveries in 2004 assuming price stabilization elimination of preowned losses and the realization of cost reduction actions taken in 2003  

net sales in 2002 were flat compared with 2001 while operating earnings decreased from losses on preowned aircraft sales charges to write down preowned aircraft inventory to fair market value fewer deliveries of large aircraft and a shift in the mix of new aircraft deliveries to include lowermargin midsize aircraft  

summary of aircraft statistical information sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft’s completion which includes exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics the company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group’s orders and backlog  

  

backlog the aerospace group’s backlog remained steady in 2003 despite the difficult market conditions ending the year at 65 billion of which 41 billion was funded the backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2010 approximately 21 billion or 51 percent of the group’s funded backlog is with netjets inc netjets a unit of berkshire hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market representing firm contracts for 114 aircraft the unfunded backlog includes 14 billion for 100 aircraft options from netjets constituting 90 percent of the options in backlog netjets also represents almost 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from 2004 through 2010 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 17 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years the group’s remaining 2 billion of funded backlog at yearend 2003 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and approximately 440 of contracts with government customers the company continues to pursue opportunities to provide special mission aircraft to military customers around the world in 2003 the company was awarded a contract to provide four gulfstream g550 aircraft to the israeli ministry of defense the contract has an option for two additional g550 aircraft for a total potential value of approximately 470 in addition the company’s gulfstream g450 aircraft was designated the platform of choice by one of the two competitors in a pending us military procurement for special mission isr applications  

resources the company’s resources group principally consists of two businesses a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry results of operations  

net sales and operating earnings in the resources group decreased in 2003 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions and reduced earnings in the company’s commercial pension plan in 2002 earnings increased because the company in response to the improved longterm outlook for some of the coal operation’s contracts reversed some contingency reserves that had been previously established  

net sales and earnings in 2002 improved over 2001 because of increased volume and improved cost performance in the aggregates business in addition as noted above earnings increased as a result of the reversal of contingency reserves financial condition liquidity and capital resources in the mid1990s the company embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment through strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company’s customer base since 1995 the company has acquired more than 30 businesses at a total cost of approximately 132 billion this has resulted in a larger more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility in terms of overall capital deployment for 2003 the company consummated over 3 billion of acquisitions repurchased approximately 47 million of its outstanding common shares at an average price of 64 per share and continued its trend of consecutive annual dividend increases meanwhile and in spite of the 3 billion in acquisitions net debt total debt less cash and equivalents increased only 21 billion — to 32 billion at december 31 2003 at the same time the company converted a significant portion of its commercial paper to fixedrate debt to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates available to the company the company ended the year with a cash balance of 860 total debt of 4 billion and a debttocapital ratio of 41 percent cash generation continues to be one of management’s key areas of focus and 2003 was a particularly strong year in this regard free cash flow from operations for the year totaled 15 billion compared with 861 in 2002 and 745 in 2001 management defines free cash flow from operations as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays the company’s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt funding business acquisitions and paying dividends the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with the cash flow from operating activities as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows  

as discussed above the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally make strategic acquisitions and repurchase the company’s shares in the open market with free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2004 the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short and longterm liquidity needs management believes  

that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy going forward in 2004 management anticipates focusing on operations and the integration of recently acquired businesses the following is a discussion of the company’s major operating investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2003 as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in 2003 compared with 11 billion in both 2002 and 2001 the increase in cash flows in 2003 was due to substantial reductions in both new and preowned aircraft inventories in the aerospace group and an influx of customer advances and deposits near the end of the year in 2002 and 2001 cash provided by operating activities approximated net income   termination of a12 program as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements litigation on the a12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 if contrary to the company’s expectations the default termination is ultimately sustained the company and the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest which was approximately 11 billion at december 31 2003 in this outcome the government contends the company’s liability would be approximately 12 billion pretax or 700 aftertax the company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation if required while still retaining ample liquidity investing activities cash used in investing activities was 32 billion in 2003 400 in 2002 and 17 billion in 2001 the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures offset slightly by cash received from the sale of assets   business acquisitions on august 11 2003 the company completed its acquisition of veridian corporation headquartered in arlington virginia for approximately 15 billion in cash on march 1 2003 the company acquired gm defense of london ontario a business unit of general motors corporation for approximately 11 billion in cash on june 14 2002 the company acquired the outstanding stock of advanced technical products inc for 214 in cash plus the assumption of 43 in outstanding

 application of critical accounting policies management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to longterm contracts and programs goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes pensions and other postretirement benefits workers’ compensation warranty obligations preowned aircraft inventory and contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application   revenue recognition — government contracts the company accounts for sales and earnings under longterm defense contracts and programs using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” rather than the cumulative catchup method under the reallocation method the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract while under the cumulative catchup method such impact would be recognized immediately if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg costs incurred or output eg units delivered measures as appropriate to the circumstances the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years including future labor productivity and availability the nature and complexity of the work to be performed availability of materials the impact of delayed performance availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries these estimates require the use of judgment a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company’s contracts the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method   business aircraft the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position 811 these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the “green” aircraft ie before exterior painting and installation of customerselected interiors and optional avionics and its completion the company records revenues at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless 1 a contract has been executed with the customer and 2 the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer  

  preowned aircraft inventories in connection with orders for new aircraft the company routinely offers customers tradein options under these options if exercised the company will accept tradein aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft the company records preowned aircraft at the lower of tradein value or estimated net realizable value the company treats any excess of the tradein price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of preowned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors including current market conditions future market conditions the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market these estimates require the use of judgment gross margins on sales of preowned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions   commitments and contingencies the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the judgment of both management and legal counsel when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters and the company’s exposure is reasonably estimable the company records a charge against earnings the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known   deferred contract costs certain costs incurred in the performance of the company’s government contracts are required to be recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts such costs include a portion of the company’s estimated workers’ compensation other insurancerelated assessments retirement benefits and environmental expenses these costs become allocable to contracts when they are paid the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid at which time they are charged to contracts and recovered from the government the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business including both existing backlog and probable followon contracts these efforts include numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on longterm defense programs the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable followon contracts this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs the extent of cost recovery under the company’s contracts and the amount of future contract activity these estimates require the use of judgment if the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs the profitability of the company’s remaining contracts could be adversely affected   pension plans the company makes assumptions about discount rates and longterm rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” these estimates require the use of judgment including consideration of both current and future market conditions the company consults with outside experts to determine the appropriate assumptions in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted future pension cost as determined under sfas 87 could increase or decrease if the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points the company’s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 in 2003 likewise had the interest rate used to discount the company’s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased by approximately 3 or decreased by approximately 2 in 2003 the company’s contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company’s government plans the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses as such the company’s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” in january 2003 the fasb revised fin 46 in december 2003 to clarify certain provisions and amend the effective date fin 46 provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities the interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the equity interest at risk is not sufficient to permit that entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or if the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics fin 46 is effective december 31 2003 for specialpurpose entities created before february 1 2003 and is effective in the first quarter of 2004 for all other variable interest entities the company does not expect the adoption of fin 46 to have a material effect on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixedrate and variablerate longterm debt obligations variablerate commercial paper and shortterm investments as of december 31 2003 the company had no shortterm investments fixedrate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company’s fixedrate debt a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in market rates of interest applicable to the company’s commercial paper balances and floatingrate notes would not have a material effect on its results of operations financial condition or cash flows the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations at december 31 2003 no interest rate swap agreements were in effect the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions in foreign currencies the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreigndenominated payments receipts and intercompany transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of 28 pretax and an incremental unrealized loss of 22 million pretax consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged when taken together these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk

based on the cabin size and range of the aircraft the aerospace group offers a total of seven products in the following market segments midcabin high speed widecabin highspeed largecabin midrange largecabin longrange and largecabin ultralongrange   the g100 midcabin highspeed business jet and the g150 widecabin highspeed business jet compete in the 12 million to 14 million pricing segment the g150 will offer many of the same performance and range features as the g100 but will have a wider and longer cabin it is scheduled to enter service in 2005 both the g100 and g150 compete with the raytheon hawker 800xp the bombardier learjet 60 and the cessna citation sovereign the g200 largecabin midrange business jet competes in the 16 million to 21 million pricing segment against

  the company believes it competes favorably in its markets on the basis of the performance characteristics of its aircraft the quality and timeliness of the service it provides its advanced technology and its innovative marketing programs customers   historically the majority of the company’s sales have been to us government agencies in 2002 64 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor 23 percent were to us commercial customers 6 percent were to international commercial customers and the remaining 7 percent were directly to international defense customers us government   net sales to the us government include foreign military sales fms which are sales to foreign governments through the us government whereby the company contracts with and receives payment from the us government and the us government assumes the risk of collection from the customer us government sales in millions were as follows    the company’s us government products and programs must compete with the products and programs of other defense contractors as well as the nondefense spending priorities of the us government the funding of government programs is dependent on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in government policies resulting from various military and political developments the company’s us government business is sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and the budget of the us government   in addition us government defense contracts typically involve long lead times for design and development and are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years consequently programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations therefore making us government programs subject to uncertain future funding levels   the company’s us government business is performed under both costreimbursement sometimes referred to as “costtype” and fixedprice contracts contracts for research engineering prototypes repair and maintenance are often costreimbursement arrangements under which the customer reimburses the company for allowable costs and pays a predetermined fee a large percentage of the company’s production contracts are fixedprice arrangements pursuant to which the company agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount for the year ended december 31 2002 costtype and fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 46 percent and 54 percent respectively of the company’s defense business   costreimbursement and fixedprice contracts present their own advantages and disadvantages for the company costtype arrangements generally involve lower risk for the company and sometimes involve fee schedules that allow the company to obtain increased payments for satisfying certain performance criteria however not all of the company’s costs are recoverable under these types of contracts and the government 8   typically has the right to object to the company’s costs as not allowable or unreasonable which can increase the company’s risk fixedprice arrangements generally provide the company with greater profit potential if it can complete the work for less than the contract amount however fixedprice contracts also put the company at risk for potential cost overruns

regulatory matters us government defense contracts   in 2002 over 60 percent of the company’s net sales were to the us government either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor generally government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives and contain provisions permitting termination in whole or in part at the government’s convenience or for default if a contract is terminated at the convenience of the us government a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and in general the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done contracts that are terminated for default generally provide that the government only pays for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages   the company’s government businesses are also subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations failure to comply with these regulations and requirements can result in civil criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines penalties suspension of payments and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time business aircraft   the aerospace group is subject to regulation by the federal aviation administration in the united states and other similar aviation regulatory authorities throughout the world for an aircraft to be manufactured and sold the model must have received a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority and each individual aircraft must have also received a certificate of airworthiness maintenance facilities are also required to be licensed by aviation authorities aviation authorities have the power to require changes to aircraft if deemed necessary for safety purposes environmental   the company’s operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge treatment storage disposal investigation and remediation of certain materials substances and wastes the company continually assesses its compliance status and management of other environmental matters the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations   operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal recurring part of the company’s operations these costs are not significant relative to total operating costs or cash flows and often are allowable costs under the company’s contracts with the us government these costs have not been material in the past and based on information presently available to the company and us government policies relating to allowable costs in effect at this time all of which are subject to change the company does not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows 11     under existing us environmental laws “potentially responsible parties” prp are jointly and severally liable and therefore the company is potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at the company’s facilities or former facilities or at thirdparty sites where the company has been designated a prp by the environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency in the unlikely event that the company is required to fully fund the remediation of a site the statutory framework would allow the company to pursue rights to contribution from other prps additional information relating to the impact of environmental controls is included in item 3 “legal proceedings —

inventions covered by the patents although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of the company’s business no existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would in the opinion of management have a material impact on the company’s business employees   as of december 31 2002 the company had approximately 54000 employees of whom 32 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions the most significant of which are the international association of machinists and aerospace

 item 3 legal proceedings   the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment   the company is primarily engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and to a lesser degree under direct foreign sales contracts some of which are funded by the us government these contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and from time to time agencies of the us government investigate whether the company’s operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements the company does not believe that the outcome of any such government investigations will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows termination of a12 program   in january 1991 the navy terminated the company’s a12 aircraft contract for default the a12 contract was a fixedprice incentive contract for the fullscale development and initial production of the navy’s carrierbased advanced tactical aircraft both the company and mcdonnell douglas now owned by the boeing company the contractors were parties to the contract with the navy each had full responsibility to the navy for performance under the contract and both are jointly and severally liable for potential liabilities arising from the termination as a consequence of the termination for default the navy demanded that the contractors repay 14 billion in unliquidated progress payments but agreed to defer collection of the amount pending a decision by the us court of federal claims on the contractors’ challenge to the termination for default or a negotiated settlement   the contractors filed a complaint on june 7 1991 in the us court of federal claims contesting the default termination in december 1994 the court issued an order vacating the termination for default on december 19 1995 following further proceedings the court issued an order converting the termination for default to a termination for convenience on march 31 1998 a final judgment was entered in favor of the contractors for 12 billion plus interest   on july 1 1999 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit found that the trial court erred in converting the termination for default to a termination for convenience without first determining whether a default existed the court of appeals remanded the case for determination of whether the government’s default termination was justified on august 31 2001 following the trial on remand the trial court issued an opinion upholding the default termination of the a12 contract in its opinion the trial court rejected all of the government’s arguments to sustain the default termination except for one schedule with respect to the government’s schedule arguments the trial court held that the schedule the government unilaterally imposed 18   was reasonable and enforceable and that the government had not waived that schedule on the sole ground that the contractors were not going to deliver the first aircraft on the date provided in the unilateral schedule the trial court upheld the default termination and entered judgment for the government 

  the contractors filed posttrial motions seeking reconsideration by the trial court of its opinion and judgment on october 4 2001 the trial court denied the contractors’ posttrial motions on november 30 2001 the company filed its notice of appeal and during 2002 the contractors and the navy filed their respective appellate briefs with the court of appeals on january 9 2003 the appeal was argued before a threejudge panel of the court of appeals   following the august 31 2001 decision of the trial court the navy and the contractors discussed the continued deferral of the payment of the 14 billion in unliquidated progress payments plus interest by an extension of the deferment agreement between the parties pursuant to which the navy had deferred collection since 1991 no agreement was reached concerning this issue though the contractors do not believe that the trial court’s decision triggers their obligation to make payment to the navy the navy took no action to collect this amount from the contractors and settlement negotiations were conducted by the parties on august 30 2002 the navy notified the contractors in writing that unless they paid within 30 days these unliquidated progress payments plus interest approximately 23 billion it would turn the matter over to the defense finance and accounting service for collection the contractors have advised the navy that they would resist collection as improper in light of the navy’s collection demand the contractors requested the trial court to enter a stay of its judgment pending the outcome of the appeal on december 13 2002 the trial court agreed and entered a stay of its judgment pending appeal   on march 17 2003 the court of appeals vacated the trial court’s judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings the court of appeals found that the trial court misapplied the controlling legal standard in concluding that the termination for default could be sustained solely on the basis of the contractors’ inability to complete the first flight of the first test aircraft by december 1991 rather the court of appeals held that in order to uphold a termination for default a trial court would have to determine that there was no reasonable likelihood that the contractors could perform the entire contract effort within the time remaining for performance this is a determination the company does not believe is supported by the evidence   if contrary to the company’s expectations the default termination is ultimately sustained the contractors could be required to repay the government as much as 14 billion for progress payments received for the a12 contract plus interest approximately 1 billion at december 31 2002 this would result in liability of approximately 12 billion pretax 685 million aftertax to be taken as a charge against discontinued operations the company has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation if required false claims act   on may 7 1999 a whistleblower suit was filed under seal against the company in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of south carolina the plaintiff alleges that the company violated the false claims act by omitting certain facts when it testified before congress in 1995 concerning funding for the third seawolfattack submarine the plaintiff sought damages in the amount of the contract award for the third seawolf subject to trebling under the false claims act the department of justice declined to intervene in the case on the plaintiff’s behalf and the suit was unsealed in december 2000 the complaint was removed to the united states district court for the district of south carolina on october 15 2002 the district court entered an order granting the company’s motions for summary judgment and directed the court to enter judgment on behalf of the company the plaintiff may appeal the judgment the company believes that any such motion or appeal by the plaintiff is likely to be denied avolar   following ual corporation’s announcement on march 22 2002 that it was closing its avolar subsidiary which was to engage in a business jet aircraft fractional ownership program the company terminated its agreements with avolar the company retained deposits totaling 50 million related to this transaction on may 28 2002 united bizjet holdings inc a subsidiary of ual corporation filed a claim against the company 19   in the circuit court of cook county illinois seeking the return of the avolar deposits on october 11 2002 the circuit court dismissed united bizjet’s complaint without prejudice for failure to engage in mandatory prelitigation mediation united bizjet moved for reconsideration but on january 3 2003 the circuit court denied reconsideration and reaffirmed its order of dismissal on december 9 2002 united bizjet filed for reorganization pursuant to chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the company believes the outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows
