our strategy

our business strategy is focused on delivering a consistently competitive shareholder return among our peer group because the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive delivering sustainable capital efficient cash flow growth is a key tenet to our success while our cash flow is highly dependent on volatile and uncertain commodity prices we pursue our strategy throughout all commodity price cycles with four fundamental principles

proven and responsible operator – we operate our business with the interests of our stakeholders and our esg values in mind with our vision to be a premier independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company the work our employees do every day contributes to the local national and global economies we produce a valuable commodity that is fundamental to society and we endeavor to do so in a safe environmentally responsible and ethical way while striving to deliver strong returns to our shareholders we have an ongoing commitment to transparency in reporting our esg performance we continue to establish new environmental performance targets for our company and further incorporate esg initiatives into our compensation structure 

premier sustainable portfolio of assets – as discussed in more detail later in this section of this annual report we own a portfolio of assets located in the united states we strive to own premier assets capable of generating cash flows in excess of our capital and operating requirements as well as competitive rates of return we also desire to own a portfolio of assets that can provide sustainable production extending many years into the future as a result of our recent merger and acquisition and divestiture activity our oil production price realizations and fieldlevel margins have continued to improve as we continue to sharpen our focus on five us oil and liquids plays located in the delaware basin anadarko basin williston basin eagle ford and powder river basin 

superior execution – as we pursue cash flow growth we continually work to optimize the efficiency of our capital programs and production operations with an underlying objective of reducing absolute and per unit costs and enhancing our returns we also strive to leverage our culture of health safety and environmental stewardship in all aspects of our business 

with the merger and continuous improvement initiatives we have built a scalable multibasin portfolio of us oil assets and continue to aggressively improve our cost structure to further expand margins we have realized annualized cost savings by reducing well costs production expenses financing costs and ga costs 

financial strength and flexibility – commodity prices are uncertain and volatile so we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet as well as adequate liquidity and financial flexibility in order to operate competitively in all commodity price cycles our capital allocation decisions are made with attention to these financial stewardship principles as well as the priorities of funding our core 

 

operations protecting our investmentgrade credit ratings and paying and growing our shareholder dividend while maintaining financial strength is a top priority we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value which is evidenced by instituting our fixed plus variable dividend strategy and making opportunistic share repurchases 

environmental social and governance

devon is focused on producing reliable affordable and accessible energy the world needs while continuing to find ways to produce and deliver it more responsibly we consider the potential impacts of our operations when planning activities and making decisions we strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations often going above and beyond what is required in the process devon incorporates technology tools and techniques that enable us to minimize or avoid effects on air water land and wildlife we are also evaluating opportunities to create value in the transition to evercleaner forms of energy seeking to leverage our strengths and partnerships 

we have a strong organization in place to manage environmental performance from our board of directors to our ehsesg leadership team and fieldlevel ehs and operations teams in recent years we have updated our governance practices to elevate ehs and esg oversight and discussion including those related to climate change and the energy transition in 2021 we renamed devon’s board governance committee as the governance environmental and public policy committee and expanded the committee’s charter to among other things underscore environmental performance and integration of sustainability into our business activities the committee frequently reviews our environmental initiatives and is keenly interested in the operational measures technological advancements and other actions that the company takes in advancing our status in this important area 

devon has established environmental performance targets that reflect our dedication and commitment to providing affordable energy while achieving meaningful emissions reductions and pursuing our ultimate goal of net zero ghg emissions for scope 1 and 2 our ghg and methane targets shown below are calculated from a 2019 baseline

 

 

devon is also focused on conserving and reusing water and interacting with our value chain on our overall environmental goals we have set a target to advance our recycled water rate and use 90 or more nonfreshwater for completions activities in our most active operating areas within the delaware basin devon is also actively engaged with our stakeholders upstream and downstream of our operations to improve esg performance across our value chain we are confident we can deliver strong operational and financial results in a manner that reduces our environmental impact while safeguarding our workforce and the communities in which we operate

human capital

delivering strong operational and financial results in a safe environmentally and socially responsible way requires the expertise and positive contributions of every devon employee consequently our people are the company’s most important resource and we seek to hire the best people who share our core values of integrity relationships courage and results to develop our workforce we focus on training safety wellness inclusion diversity and equality as of december 31 2021 devon and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 1600 employees all located in the us

employee safety and wellness 

we prepare our workforce to work safely with comprehensive training and orientation onthejob guidance and tools safety engagements recognition and other resources employees and contractors are expected to comply with safety rules and regulations and are accountable for stopping atrisk work immediately reporting incidents and nearmiss events and informing visitors of emergency alarms and evacuation plans to safeguard workers on our well sites and neighbors nearby we plan design drill complete and produce wells using proven best practices technologies tools and materials

in response to the covid19 pandemic we formally established a covid19 team focused on developing and implementing a number of safety measures to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities with a strong focus on employee wellbeing health and safety the covid19 team established an information campaign to provide employees an understanding of the virus risk factors and safety measures as well as timely updates from governmental regulations 

 

beyond employee safety devon also prioritizes the physical mental and financial wellness of our employees we offer competitive health and financial benefits with incentives designed to promote well  being  including an employee assistance program  “ eap ”  that provides virtual counseling services for employees and their family members free of charge access to experienced counselors financial experts staff attorneys eldercare consultants and concierge services is included in eap services available 365 days a year 24 hours a day devon encourages employees to take advantage of our wellness programs and activities by getting an annual physical exam  attending preventive health screenings and completing a financial wellness series at no cost to employees 

employee compensation benefits and development

we strive to attract and retain highperforming individuals across our workforce one way we do this is by providing competitive compensation and benefits including annual bonuses a 401k savings plan with a devon contribution up to 14 of the employee’s earnings stock awards for all employees medical dental and vision health care coverage health savings and dependentcare flexible spending accounts maternity and parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child an adoption assistance program alternate work schedules flexible work hours parttime work options and telecommuting support among other benefits 

devon also looks to our core values to build the workforce we need we develop our employees’ knowledge and creativity and advance continual learning and career development through ongoing performance training and development conversations 

diversity equity and inclusion

devon’s success depends on employees who demonstrate integrity accountability perseverance and a passion for building our business and delivering results our efforts to create a workforce with these qualities start with offering equal opportunity in all aspects of employment we do this with company policies and leadership commitment and by providing employees opportunities to help shape devon’s diversity equity and inclusion direction and actions

we strive to demonstrate inclusion equity and diversity throughout the company to bring a range of thoughts experiences and points of view to our problemsolving and decisionmaking along with senior leadership efforts devon’s diversity equity and inclusion “dei” team works to proactively increase diversity and inclusion awareness identify challenges and find innovative ways to achieve devon’s inclusion and diversity vision and priorities in 2021 our workforce was comprised of 24 females and 22 minorities along with our workforce efforts we invest in dei through community partnerships one way we are achieving this is by creating stem centers in elementary schools in the areas in which we operate devon has helped open more than 100 stem centers that orient children of all backgrounds to skills that will be essential for the future workforce in 2021 devon awarded nine inclusion and equity grants ranging from 5000 to 25000 to nine diverse community organizations throughout oklahoma city this program plans to expand in 2022 to reach additional organizations across more of the company’s operational areas 

compliance culture

we reinforce the high expectations we have for ethical conduct by our employees through our code of business conduct and ethics “code” the code sets out basic principles for all employees to follow and incorporates specific guidance on critical areas such as our prohibition of harassment and discrimination our protocols for avoiding conflicts of interest and our policies related to anticorruption laws privacy cybersecurity and confidential information on an annual basis devon employees as well as our directors and officers are required to acknowledge and agree to abide by our code and complete a training course on the code and its related policies we encourage our employees to help enforce the code and maintain reporting systems that are designed to minimize concerns that reports will result in retaliation 

  

 

 

oil and gas properties

property profiles

key summary data from each of our areas of operation as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 are detailed in the map below

delaware basin – the delaware basin is our most active program in the portfolio we acquired additional acreage in the delaware basin through the merger creating an industry leading position in this basin through capital efficient drilling programs it offers exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich wolfcamp bone spring avalon and delaware formations with a significant inventory of oil and liquidsrich drilling opportunities that have multizone development potential devon has a robust platform to deliver highmargin drilling programs for many years to come at december 31 2021 we had 13 operated rigs developing this asset in the wolfcamp bone spring and avalon formations the delaware basin is our top funded asset and is expected to receive approximately 75 of our capital allocation in 2022 

anadarko basin  – our anadarko basin development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties provides longterm optionality through its significant inventory our anadarko basin position is one of the largest in the industry providing visible longterm production we have an agreement with dow to jointly develop a portion of our anadarko basin acreage and as of december 31 2021 we had a two operated rig program associated with this joint venture dow will fund approximately 65 of the partnership capital requirements through a remaining drilling carry of approximately 65 million over the next three years 

williston basin  – we acquired our position in the williston basin through the merger in 2021 it is located entirely on the fort berthold indian reservation and its operations are focused in the oilprone bakken and three forks formations the williston basin 

 

is a highmargin oil resource located in the core of the play and generated substantial cash flow in 202 1  at december 31 2021 we had one operated rig developing this asset   

eagle ford – our eagle ford operations are located in dewitt county texas situated in the economic core of the play its production is leveraged to oil and has lowcost access to premium gulf coast pricing providing for strong operating margins 

powder river basin – this asset is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin we are currently targeting several cretaceous oil objectives including the turner parkman teapot and niobrara formations at december 31 2021 we had one operated rig developing this asset 

proved reserves

 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence within a reasonable time we establish our proved reserves estimates using standard geological and engineering technologies and computational methods which are generally accepted by the petroleum industry we primarily prepare our proved reserves additions by analogy using type curves that are based on decline curve analysis of wells in analogous reservoirs we further establish reasonable certainty of our proved reserves estimates by using one or more of the following methods geological and geophysical information to establish reservoir continuity between penetrations ratetransient analysis analytical and numerical simulations or other proprietary technical and statistical methods for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 22 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves in compliance with applicable sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” the group which is led by devon’s manager of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the manager and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates and are independent of the operating groups the manager of the group has over 15 years of industry experience a degree in engineering and is a registered professional engineer the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by a qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firm during 2021 we engaged laroche petroleum consultants ltd to audit approximately 88 of our proved reserves additionally our board of directors has a reserves committee that provides additional oversight of our reserves process the committee consists of five independent members of our board of directors who collectively have skills and backgrounds that are relevant to the reserves estimation processes reporting systems and disclosure requirements 

the following tables present production price and cost information for each significant field in our asset portfolio and the total company

 



 

 

 



 



drilling statistics

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results we did not have any dry development or exploratory wells drilled for the years 2021 2020 or 2019 

 



 





productive wells

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2021

 



 







the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 5134 gross wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing drilling and construction overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of ga which is a common industry practice

acreage statistics

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2021 of our 19 million net acres approximately 12 million acres are held by production the acreage in the table below does not include any 

 

material net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 20 2 2  202 3 and 202 4  for t he net acres that are set to expire by december 31 202 4  we anticipate performing operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business  l ess than 20 of our total net acres are located on federal lands 

 



 





title to properties

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry a preliminary title investigation typically consisting of a review of local title records is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties more thorough title investigations which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside legal counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

marketing activities

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2022 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 



 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2021 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

 

 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

competition

see “item 1a risk factors”

public policy and government regulation

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and changes to existing laws and regulations are frequently proposed or implemented we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations

exploration and production regulation

our operations are subject to various federal state tribal and local laws and regulations relating to exploration and production activities including with respect to



























our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate exploration and development while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases such rules may impact the ultimate timing of our exploration and development plans in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members moreover the permitting process for oil and gas activities on federal and indian lands can sometimes be subject to delay which can hinder development activities or otherwise adversely impact operations the 

 

federal government has from time to time evaluated and in some cases promulgated new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations

we strive to conduct our operations in a socially and environmentally responsible manner which includes compliance with applicable law we are subject to many federal state tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment and natural resources environmental health and safety laws and regulations relate to



















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which can allow environmental organizations to sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law environmental organizations also can assert legal and administrative challenges to certain actions of oil and gas regulators such as the blm for allegedly failing to comply with environmental laws which can result in delays in obtaining permits or other necessary authorizations in recent years federal and state policy makers and regulators have increasingly implemented or proposed new laws and regulations designed to reduce methane emissions and other ghg which have included mandates for new leak detection and retrofitting requirements stricter emission standards and a proposed fee on methane emission leaks for example in november 2021 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration issued a final rule significantly expanding reporting and safety requirements for operators of gas gathering pipelines including previously unregulated pipelines

environmental protection and health and safety compliance are necessary parts of our business that we historically have been able to plan for and comply with without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws and permitting requirements our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase 

 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example over the last five years monthly nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub gas prices ranged from highs of over 80 per bbl and 600 per mmbtu respectively to lows of under 30 per bbl and 150 per mmbtu respectively such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to































our business has been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we may experience continuing or worsening adverse effects from this or other pandemics

the covid19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry the pandemic and the related responses of governmental authorities and others to limit the spread of the virus significantly reduced global economic activity which resulted in an unprecedented decline in the demand for oil and other commodities during 2020 this decline contributed to a swift and material deterioration in commodity prices in early 2020 although commodity prices subsequently recovered covid19 or its variants may lead to similar protracted periods of depressed commodity prices which in turn could have significant adverse consequences for our financial condition and liquidity moreover the covid19 pandemic has contributed to disruption and volatility in our supply chain which has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs and delays for pipe and other materials needed for our operations 

the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions aimed at mitigating its spread have caused us and our service providers to modify certain of our business practices there is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus including the risk of infection of key employees our operations also may be adversely affected if we or our service providers are unable to retain sufficient personnel or such personnel are unable to work effectively including because of 

 

illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic moreover  our ability to perform certain functions could be disrupted or otherwise impaired by new business practices arising from the pandemic  for example our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to the encouragement of remote communications and other socialdistancing practices which could make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks 

the covid19 pandemic and its related effects continue to evolve the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and any other future pandemic on our business will depend on future developments including but not limited to the nature duration and spread of the virus the vaccination and other responsive actions to stop its spread or address its effects and the duration timing and severity of the related consequences on commodity prices and the economy more generally any extended period of depressed commodity prices or general economic disruption as a result of a pandemic would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development and appraisal activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production and such activities are capital intensive

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors moreover our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

our business requires significant capital to find and acquire new reserves although we plan to primarily fund these activities from cash generated by our operations we have also from time to time relied on other sources of capital including by accessing the debt and equity capital markets there can be no assurance that these or other financing sources will be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason we may be unable to replace our reserves which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business

our operations are subject to extensive federal state tribal and local laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators including corporate successors of former operators these requirements may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions

 

in addition changes in public policy have affected and in the future could further affect our operations for example president biden and certain members of his administration and congress have expressed support for and have taken steps to implement efforts to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and to promote stricter environmental regulations and such proposals could impose new and more onerous burdens on our industry and business these and other r egulatory and public policy developments could among other things restrict production levels delay necessary permitting impose price controls change environmental protection requirements  impose restrictions on pipelines or other necessary infrastructure and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations in addition changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by among other things increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to the matters discussed in more detail below  

federal lands – president biden and certain members of his administration have expressed support for and have taken steps to implement additional regulation of oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands for example president biden issued an executive order in january 2021 directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering new oil and gas leases on public lands to the extent possible and to launch a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands although the pause on leasing was lifted in june 2021 the department of the interior subsequently issued its report on the federal leasing program in november 2021 the report recommended various changes to the program including among other things increasing royalty and rental rates enhancing bonding requirements and applying a more rigorous landuse planning process prior to leasing however certain of the report’s recommendations require congressional actions and we cannot predict to what extent if any the department of the interior may be able to promulgate rules implementing the recommendations of the november 2021 report while it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these or any other future regulatory changes any additional restrictions or burdens on our ability to operate on federal lands could adversely impact our business in the delaware and powder river basins as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases as of december 31 2021 less than 20 of our total leasehold resides on federal lands which is primarily located in the delaware and powder river basins 

hydraulic fracturing – various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process for example the epa has issued regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and it finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a report in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources in certain circumstances the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017 moreover several states in which we operate have adopted or stated intentions to adopt laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing imposing more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing in addition to state laws local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular 

beyond these regulatory efforts various policy makers regulatory agencies and political leaders at the federal state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing including prohibiting the technology outright although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations

environmental laws generally – in addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing we are subject to various other federal state tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations or prior operations on assets we have acquired environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

seismic activity – earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma southeastern new mexico western texas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry particularly the disposal of wastewater in saltwater disposal wells legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs 

 

or otherwise adversely affect our operations for example new mexico implemented protocols in november 2021 requiring operators to take various actions with respect to saltwater disposal wells within a specified proximity of certain seismic activity including a requirement to limit injection rates if the seismic event is of a certain magnitude separately the railroad commission of texas recently imposed limits on certain saltwater disposal well activities in portions of the midland basin these or similar actions directed at our operating areas could limit the takeaway capacity for produced water in the impacted area which could increase our operating expense require us to curtail our development plans or otherwise adversely impact our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate or previously operated income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions such as intangible drilling costs and the timing of such deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow in addition new taxes are from time to time proposed such as minimum taxes on net book income and if enacted could adversely impact us 

climate change and related regulatory social and market actions may adversely affect our business

continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative regulatory and other initiatives including international agreements to reduce ghg emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane policy makers and regulators at both the us federal and state levels have already imposed or stated intentions to impose laws and regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of ghg for example the epa proposed rules in november 2021 that if adopted would among other things i broaden methane and volatile organic compounds emission reduction requirements for certain oil and gas facilities including a zeroemission standard for pneumatic controllers and ii impose standards to eliminate venting of associated gas and require capture and sale of gas where sale line is available at new and existing oil wells the epa plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the november 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of a final rule by the end of the year congress also recently considered legislation that included a proposal to apply a fee on certain methane emissions from oil and gas facilities although the fate of this “methane fee” is uncertain at this time in addition to these federal efforts several states where we operate including new mexico texas and wyoming have already imposed or stated intentions to impose laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities including by mandating new leak detection and retrofitting requirements with respect to more comprehensive regulation policy makers and political leaders have made or expressed support for a variety of proposals such as the development of capandtrade or carbon tax programs in addition president biden has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration and he previously released an energy plan calling for a number of sweeping changes to address climate change including among other measures a national mobilization effort to achieve netzero emissions for the us economy by 2050 through increased use of renewable power stricter fuelefficiency standards and support for zeroemission vehicles president biden issued a number of executive orders in january 2021 with the purpose of implementing certain of these changes including the rejoining of the paris agreement and directing federal agencies to procure electric vehicles president biden subsequently announced a target of reducing economywide net ghg emissions in the us by 50 to 52 below 2005 levels by 2030 at the international level the united states and the european union jointly announced the launch of a global methane pledge at the 26th conference of the parties in november 2021 pursuant to which over 100 participating countries have pledged to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 from 2020 levels by 2030 although the full impact of these actions is uncertain at this time the adoption and implementation of these or other initiatives may result in the restriction or cancellation of oil and natural gas activities greater costs of compliance or consumption thereby reducing demand for our products or an impairment in our ability to continue our operations in an economic manner

in addition to regulatory risk other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business for example in an effort to promote a lowercarbon economy there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing or otherwise encouraging the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbonbased fuels such as oil and gas moreover an increasing number of financial institutions funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations in addition governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought and may continue to bring claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change the increasing attention to climate change may result in further claims or investigations against us and heightened societal or political pressures may increase the possibility that liability could be imposed on us in such matters without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or violation or to other mitigating factors 

 

f inally c limate change may also result in various enhanced physical risks such as an increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns that may adversely impact our operations such physical risks may result in damage to our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations such as if we are subject to water use curtailments in response to drought or demand for our products such as to the extent warmer winters reduce demand for energy for heating purposes these and the other risks discussed above could result in additional costs new restrictions on our operations and reputational harm to us as well as reduce the actual and forecasted demand for our products these affects in turn could impair or lower the value of our assets including by resulting in uneconomic or “stranded” assets and otherwise adversely impact our profitability liquidity and financial condition 

our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks

our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to





















the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property as well as significant liabilities moreover certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant damage to property and natural resources for example we have from time to time experienced wellcontrol events that have resulted in various remediation and cleanup costs and certain of the other impacts described above

in addition we rely on our employees consultants and subcontractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals whether through negligence harassment discrimination or other misconduct could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business for example negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury death or property damage and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our 

 

hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of laws and related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements  

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective share of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities including contingent liabilities owed to and assumed from us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities which could adversely impact our financial results and condition

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us

as of december 31 2021 we had total indebtedness of 65 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned asset sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding the use of these technologies in our operations including through artificial intelligence process automation and data analytics concurrent with the growing dependence on technology is a greater sensitivity to cyber attack related activities which have increasingly targeted our industry cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating confidential and proprietary information intellectual property or financial assets corrupting data or causing operational disruptions as well as preventing users from accessing systems or information for the purpose of demanding payment in order for users to regain access these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders techniques used in these attacks often range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be performed in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks in addition our vendors midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which in turn could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences including litigation risks moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities 

 

we have limited control over properties operated by others or through joint ventures

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures in addition we conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties and the other joint venture participants may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us these limitations and our dependence on such third parties could result in unexpected future costs or liabilities and unplanned changes in operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales

we rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

insurance does not cover all risks

as discussed above our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development and production of oil gas and ngls to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks including pollution events that are considered gradual war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic longterm positions and relationships including with respect to midstream takeaway capacity as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations

our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change

investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by stockholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise these actions may be prompted or exacerbated by unfavorable recommendations or ratings from proxy advisory firms or other third parties including with respect to our performance under esg metrics such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business such perceived uncertainty may in turn make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock

 

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks 

our business depends in part on making acquisitions including by merger and other similar transactions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions such as the merger they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to







in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations

dividends whether fixed or variable and share repurchases are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors including the company’s financial results cash requirements and future prospects as well as such other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or authorize share repurchases at the current rate or at all any elimination of or downward revision in our dividend payout or share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

the following discussion and analyses primarily focus on 2021 and 2020 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2021 and 2020 discussions of 2019 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this report can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our 2020 annual report on form 10k  

 

executive overview

 

the merger has helped us become a leading unconventional oil producer in the us with an asset base underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the delaware basin this strategic combination accelerates our transition to a cashreturn business model including the implementation of a fixed plus variable dividend strategy we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of achieving disciplined oil volume growth capturing operational and corporate synergies reducing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow maintaining low leverage delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing esg excellence our recent performance highlights for these priorities include the following items 

 

















we operate under a disciplined returnsdriven strategy focused on delivering strong operational results financial strength and value to our shareholders and continuing our commitment to esg excellence which provides us with a strong foundation to grow returns margin and profitability we continue to execute on our strategy and navigate through various economic environments by protecting our financial strength maintaining a commitment to capital discipline improving our cash cost structure and preserving operational continuity 

 

 

 

commodity prices strengthened throughout 2021 which significantly improved our earnings and cash flow generation the increase in commodity prices was primarily driven by increased demand resulting from the initial recovery from the covid19 pandemic as well as opec and other oil and natural gas producers not rapidly increasing current production levels

 



 

trends of our annual earnings operating cash flow ebitdax and capital expenditures are shown below the annual earnings chart and cash flow chart present amounts pertaining to devon’s continuing operations “core earnings” and “ebitdax” are financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap for a description of these measures including reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures see “nongaap measures” in this item 7 

 

 

our earnings in 2020 were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices and deterioration of the macroeconomic environment resulting from the unprecedented covid19 pandemic earnings improved significantly in 2021 due to commodity prices recovering from the initial covid19 pandemic as well as the merger closing in january 2021 led by an 85 and 71 increase in henry hub and wti from 2020 to 2021 respectively our unhedged combined realized price rose 107 additionally volumes increased 72 from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the merger as well as continued development of assets in the delaware basin 

 

our net earnings in recent years have been significantly impacted by asset impairments and temporary noncash adjustments to the value of our commodity hedges net earnings in 2019 2020 and 2021 included a 05 billion 01 billion and 01 billion hedge 

 

valuation loss respectively net of taxes additionally n et earnings in 2020 included 22 billion of asset impairments on our proved and unproved properties net of taxes due to reduced demand from the covid19 pandemic excluding these amounts our core earnings have been more stable over recent years but continue to be heavily influenced by commodity prices 

 

 

like earnings our operating cash flow is sensitive to volatile commodity prices our cash flow and ebitdax increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the higher commodity prices and the increase in sold volumes driven by the merger and improved postmerger operating performance 

 

we exited 2021 with 53 billion of liquidity comprised of 23 billion of cash and 30 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility we currently have 65 billion of debt outstanding with no maturities until august 2023 we currently have approximately 20 and 30 of our 2022 oil and gas production hedged respectively these contracts consist of collars and swaps based off the wti oil benchmark and the henry hub and nymex last day natural gas indices additionally we have entered into regional basis swaps in an effort to protect price realizations across our portfolio 

 

as commodity prices and our operating performance strengthen and bolster our financial condition we have authorized opportunistic repurchases of up to 16 billion shares of our common stock through the end of 2022 we repurchased approximately 14 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2021 for approximately 589 million or 4215 per share additionally we continue funding our fixed plus variable dividends which totaled 13 billion in 2021 we recently declared a dividend payable in the first quarter of 2022 for 663 million 

 

business and industry outlook 

 

in 2021 devon marked its 50th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 33rd year as a public company on january 7 2021 we completed a transformational merger of equals with wpx which nearly doubled the size and scale of devon’s oil production while further strengthening our leadership team the quality of our portfolio of assets and our balance sheet during 2021 w e successfully integrated the two companies capturing our targeted merger synergies and delivering strong financial and operational results to generate 49 billion of operating cash flow for the year 

the strategic combination with wpx has accelerated our cash return business model that includes reduced capital reinvestment rates and a disciplined returnsdriven strategy to generate higher free cash flow in line with this business model we redeemed 12 billion of debt and returned nearly 2 billion of cash to shareholders through our fixed plus variable cash dividends and share repurchases additionally our margins have benefited from mergerrelated synergies with approximately 600 million in total annual savings including overhead synergies and interest cost savings from completed debt reductions 

 

our disciplined strategy is in response to current market fundamentals that indicate a continued recovery in global oil demand along with an outlook for strong market prices for crude oil and natural gas that also remain inherently volatile in 2021 wti oil prices averaged 6786 per barrel versus 3959 per barrel in 2020 crude prices experienced significant improvement from the prior year but volatility remained due to opec oil supply uncertainty and market fears from new covid19 variants that could risk the global recovery from the pandemic looking ahead current market fundamentals indicate that 2022 crude pricing is expected to continue to stabilize supported both by a continued recovery in global demand with the easing of travel restrictions and expected continued capital discipline by oil producers however uncertainty still exists depending on new covid19 variants as well as 

 

actions taken by opec countries in supporting a balanced global crude supply natural gas prices rebounded in 2021 due to continued global economic recovery supply constraints and production declines  u s liquefied natural gas exports also strengthened in 2021 with increased spot price s in asia and europe due to increased demand as a result of lifting covid19 restrictions and unplanned outages at liquefied natural gas export facilities in other countries looking forward natural gas and ngl prices are expected to flatten or decrease due to slowing growth in liquefied natural gas exports rising u  s  natural gas production and warmerthanexpected weather 

our strategy of spending well within cash flow mitigates risks to our financial strength due to commodity market volatility and provides for a lower level of hedging our 2022 cash flow is partly protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge position that covers approximately 20 of our anticipated oil volumes and 30 of our anticipated gas volumes further insulating our cash flow we continue to examine and when appropriate execute attractive regional basis swap hedges to protect price realizations across our portfolio 

with our 2022 capital program we expect to continue our capitalefficiency focus and our steadfast commitment to capital discipline to achieve our 2022 capital program objectives that maximize free cash flow approximately 75 of our 2022 spend is expected to be allocated to our highest margin us oil play the delaware basin we expect to continue to leverage the strengths of our multibasin strategy and deploy the remainder of our 2022 capital in our remaining core areas of eagle ford anadarko basin powder river basin and williston basin in total our 2022 operating plan is expected to maintain our oil production at similar levels as 2021 however some of our capital cost efficiencies could be eroded by global supply chain disruptions and demand growth which have led to rising levels of cost inflation that could also impact our capital and operating costs despite these pressures our capital forecasts account for the estimated impact of such cost inflation and we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow at current commodity price levels

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following graph discussion and analysis are intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations and current financial condition to facilitate the review these numbers are being presented before consideration of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests analysis of the change in net earnings from continuing operations is shown below 

 

our 2021 net earnings were 28 billion compared to a net loss of 25 billion for 2020 the graph below shows the change in net earnings loss from 2020 to 2021 the material changes are further discussed by category on the following pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

production volumes

 



 



 



 



 

from 2020 to 2021 the change in volumes contributed to a 22 billion increase in earnings due to the merger closing on january 7 2021 volumes now include wpx legacy assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota volumes associated with these wpx legacy assets were approximately 229 mboed for 2021 continued development of devon legacy assets in the delaware basin also increased volumes these increases were partially offset by reduced activity across devon’s remaining legacy assets 

realized prices

 



 



 



 



 

from 2020 to 2021 realized prices contributed to a 47 billion increase in earnings unhedged realized oil gas and ngl prices increased primarily due to higher wti henry hub and mont belvieu index prices the increase in index prices was partially offset by hedge cash settlements related to all products in 2021

hedge settlements

 



 

  

cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to the instruments described in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

production expenses

 



 

production expenses increased primarily due to the merger closing on january 7 2021 for additional information see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report partially offsetting increases to gathering processing and transportation costs were approximately 60 million of anadarko volume commitments which expired at the end of 2020 production taxes also increased due to the rise of commodity prices 

 

fieldlevel cash margin

 

the table below presents the fieldlevel cash margin for each of our operating areas fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses and is not prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation to the comparable gaap measures is found in “nongaap measures” in this item 7 the changes in production volumes realized prices and production expenses shown above had the following impacts on our fieldlevel cash margins by asset

 



 

dda and asset impairments

 



dda increased in 2021 primarily due to the merger closing on january 7 2021 for additional information see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

asset impairments were 27 billion in 2020 due to significant decreases in commodity prices resulting primarily from the covid19 pandemic for additional information see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

general and administrative expense

 



labor and benefits increased primarily due to the merger closing on january 7 2021 however devon’s ga per boe rate decreased 32 primarily due to synergies resulting from the merger 

 

other items

 



  

we recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationship between contract prices and the associated forward curves

exploration expenses decreased primarily due to unproved asset impairments of 152 million in 2020 for additional information see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

asset dispositions includes 110 million related to the revaluation of contingent earnout payments associated with our divested barnett shale assets and 39 million related to the sale of noncore assets in the rockies for additional information see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

capital resources uses and liquidity

 

sources and uses of cash

the following table presents the major changes in cash and cash equivalents for the time periods presented below

 



 

operating cash flow and wpx acquired cash

as presented in the table above net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity operating cash flow increased 235 during 2021 compared to 2020 the increase was due to the merger and commodity prices significantly increasing in 2021 as well as cost synergies captured after the merger

divestitures of property and equipment

during 2021 and 2020 we sold noncore us upstream assets for approximately 79 million and 34 million respectively

capital expenditures

the amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods

 



 

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties capital expenditures increased in 2021 primarily due to the merger closing on january 7 2021 and results now include activity related to wpx legacy assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota our capital program is designed to operate within operating cash flow this is evidenced by our operating cash 

 

flow fully funding capital expenditures for 20 2 1 and 20 20  our capital investment program is driven by a disciplined allocation process focused on maximizing returns 

debt activity net

subsequent to the merger closing we redeemed 12 billion of senior notes in 2021 we also paid 59 million of cash retirement costs related to these redemptions  

 

repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions

we repurchased 14 million shares of common stock for 589 million in 2021 and 22 million shares of common stock for 38 million in 2020 under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors for additional information see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report 

the following table summarizes our common stock dividends in 2021 and 2020 we raised our quarterly dividend by 22 to 011 per share in the second quarter of 2020 in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend we paid a variable dividend in each quarter of 2021 and a special dividend in 2020 to shareholders on october 1 2020 for additional information see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 



 

noncontrolling interest activity net

during 2021 we received 4 million of contributions from our noncontrolling interests primarily in cdm and distributed 21 million to our noncontrolling interests in cdm in the first quarter of 2021 we paid 24 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest portion of a partnership that wpx had formed to acquire minerals in the delaware basin 

during 2020 we received 21 million in contributions from our noncontrolling interests in cdm and distributed 14 million to our noncontrolling interests in cdm

liquidity

the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive because oil natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource we like all upstream operators must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production generally our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells at opportunistic times we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets 

on january 7 2021 devon and wpx completed an allstock merger of equals with the merger we accelerated our transition to a cashreturn business model which moderates growth emphasizes capital efficiencies and prioritizes cash returns to shareholders these principles will position devon to be a consistent builder of economic value through the cycle the postmerger scalability enhanced devon’s free cash flow credit profile and decreased the overall cost of capital

 

historically our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances if needed we can also issue debt and equity securities  including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements  as discussed in this section  as well as accelerate our cashreturn business model  

operating cash flow

key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years at the end of 2021 we held approximately 23 billion of cash inclusive of 160 million of cash restricted primarily for retained obligations related to divested assets our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables may differ from our expectations 

commodity prices – the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce and sell prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2021 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

further when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities additionally as commodity prices have increased we remain committed to a maintenance capital program for the foreseeable future we do not intend to add any growth projects until market fundamentals recover excess inventory clears up and opec curtailed volumes are effectively absorbed by the world markets

operating expenses – commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices furthermore the covid19 pandemic has contributed to disruption and volatility in our supply chain which has resulted and may continue to result in increased costs and delays for pipe and other materials needed for our operations 

merger synergies – we realized a 600 million reduction of annualized cost savings from synergies resulting from the merger through cost reductions and efficiencies related to our capital programs ga financing costs and production expenses approximately 35 of the reduced costs were related to our capital programs and the remainder relate to our operating expenses including ga interest expense and production expenses 

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

repayment of debt

in conjunction with the merger we assumed a principal value of 33 billion of wpx debt subsequent to the merger closing we have reduced our debt by approximately 12 billion we expect these redemptions to lower our annual cash net financing costs by approximately 70 million we have no debt maturities until 2023

credit availability

we have 30 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31 2021 the senior credit facility matures on october 5 2024 with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional oneyear periods subject to lender consent subsequent to october 5 2023 the borrowing capacity decreases to 28 billion the senior credit facility supports our 30 

 

billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 20 2 1  there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 14 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with this covenant with a 25 debttocapitalization ratio

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not subject to a specific funding condition requiring the absence of a “material adverse effect” it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such provisions in general these provisions can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit agreement includes provisions qualified by material adverse effect as well as a covenant that requires us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness 

debt ratings

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s financial services is bbb with a positive outlook our credit rating from fitch is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from moody’s investor service is baa3 with a stable outlook any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

fixed plus variable dividend

 

following the closing of the merger we initiated a new “fixed plus variable” dividend strategy our board of directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend if any including a general target of paying out approximately 10 of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend in february 2022 our board of directors increased our quarterly fixed dividend rate by 45 to 016 per share in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend we may pay a variable dividend up to 50 of our excess free cash flow which is a nongaap measure each quarter’s excess free cash flow is computed as operating cash flow a gaap measure before balance sheet changes less capital expenditures and the fixed dividend the declaration and payment of any future dividend whether fixed or variable will remain at the full discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial results cash requirements future prospects covid19 impacts and other factors deemed relevant by the board devon paid 13 billion of total fixed and variable dividends during 2021 

 

in february 2022 devon announced a cash dividend in the amount of 100 per share payable in the first quarter of 2022 the dividend consists of a fixed quarterly dividend in the amount of 106 million or 016 per share and a variable dividend in the amount of approximately 557 million or 084 per share 

share repurchase program

in february 2022 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by an additional 06 billion the 16 billion program expires december 31 2022 and in the fourth quarter of 2021 we executed 06 billion of the authorized program

 

capital expenditures 

our 2022 capital expenditure budget is expected to be approximately 21 billion to 24 billion

contractual obligations

as of december 31 2021 our material contractual obligations include debt interest expense asset retirement obligations lease obligations retained obligations related to our barnett shale assets and canadian business operational agreements drilling and facility obligations and various tax obligations as discussed above we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our short and longterm contractual obligations including the obligations we assumed through the merger see notes 6  8  14  15  16 and 20 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors

purchase accounting

periodically we acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations such as the merger with wpx in connection with the merger as the accounting acquirer we allocated the 54 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the date of the merger 

we made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties we prepared estimates and engaged thirdparty valuation experts significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include among other things estimates of reserve quantities estimates of future commodity prices expected development costs lease operating costs reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates

estimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in devon’s financial statements a higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher dda expense which results in lower net earnings fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices reserve quantities development costs and operating costs in the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable

in addition to the fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties other fair value assessments for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger relate to debt the equity method investment in catalyst and outofmarket contract liabilities the fair value of the assumed wpx publicly traded debt was based on available thirdparty quoted prices we prepared estimates and engaged thirdparty valuation experts to assist in the valuation of the equity method investment in catalyst significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this estimate included projected catalyst cash flows comparable companies cash flow multiples and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate the fair value of assumed outofmarket contract assets and liabilities associated with longerterm marketing gathering processing and transportation contracts included significant judgments and assumptions related to determining the market rates estimates of future reserves and production associated with the respective contracts and applying an applicable market participant discount rate

 

 

 

oil and gas assets accounting classification reserves  valuation

successful efforts method of accounting and classification 

we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize then subject to dda calculations and impairment assessments and valuations

 

once a well is drilled the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience development wells are always capitalized costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed when making this determination management considers current activities nearterm plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized at december 31 2021 all suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year

 

similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs costs for undeveloped leasehold for which reserves have not been proven must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment at the end of each quarter management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans drilling activity results commodity price outlooks planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects at december 31 2021 devon had approximately 733 million of undeveloped leasehold costs of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31 2021 approximately 19 million is scheduled to expire in 2022 the leasehold expiring in 2022 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling if our drilling is not successful this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired 

 

reserves

our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dda calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a thirdparty petroleum consulting firm in 2021 88 of our reserves were subjected to such an audit

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

valuation of longlived assets

longlived assets used in operations including proved and unproved oil and gas properties are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group for dda calculations and impairment assessments management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level “common operating field” for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition which requires judgment management also considers the nature of production common infrastructure common sales points common processing plants common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations these determinations impact the amount of dda recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment

 

management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes commodity prices operating costs and capital investment plans considering all available information at the date of review the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and riskadjusted proved undeveloped reserves  and when needed probable and possible reserves 

besides the riskadjusted estimates of reserves and future production volumes future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pretax cash flows for our impairment determinations we utilize nymex forward strip prices and incorporate internally generated price forecasts along with price forecasts published by reputable investment banks and reservoir engineering firms to estimate our future revenues

we also estimate and escalate or deescalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history to measure indicated impairments we use a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital to discount the future net cash flows changes to any of the reserves or marketbased assumptions can significantly affect estimates of undiscounted and discounted pretax cash flows and impact the recognition and amount of impairments

reduced demand from the covid19 pandemic and management of production levels from opec caused wti pricing to decrease more than 60 during the first quarter of 2020 as a result we reduced our planned 2020 capital investment 45 with materially lower commodity prices and reduced nearterm investment we assessed all our oil and gas fields for impairment as of march 31 2020 and recognized proved and unproved impairments totaling 28 billion the impairments relate to our anadarko basin and rockies fields in which our basis included acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 respectively when commodity prices were much higher than the first quarter of 2020

as a result of the impairments recognized in 2020 and the significant increases in commodity prices during 2021 none of our oil and gas assets were at risk of impairment as of december 31 2021

income taxes

 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to significant increases in commodity pricing and projections of future income in the fourth quarter of 2021 devon reassessed its evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years and determined that a us federal valuation allowance was no longer necessary as such devon removed its remaining us federal valuation allowance 

further in the event we were to undergo an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited generally an “ownership change” occurs if one or more shareholders each of whom owns five percent or more in value of a corporation’s stock increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50 over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding threeyear period based on currently available information we do not believe an ownership change has occurred during 2021 for devon but the merger did cause an ownership change for wpx and increased the likelihood devon could experience an ownership change over the next two years see note 8 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for further discussion regarding our net operating losses and tax credits available to be carried forward and used in future years 

goodwill

 

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount as part of our qualitative assessment we considered the general macroeconomic industry and market conditions changes in cost factors actual and expected financial performance significant changes in management strategy or customers and stock performance if the qualitative assessment determines that a 

 

quantitative goodwill impairment test is required then the fair value is compared to the carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value because quoted market prices are not available the fair value is estimated based upon a valuation analys i s including comparable companies and transactions and premiums paid the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 

because the trading price of our common stock decreased 73 during the first quarter of 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we performed a goodwill impairment test as of march 31 2020 the two most critical judgments included in the march 31 2020 test were the period utilized to determine devon’s market capitalization and the control premium for the test performed as of march 31 2020 we derived our market capitalization by using our average common stock price from the latter two thirds of march 2020 to align with the time in the quarter subsequent to a key opec meeting and the date covid19 was officially classified as a pandemic we applied a control premium based on recent comparable market transactions we concluded an impairment was not required as of march 31 2020 for the remainder of 2020 no impairment was required as devon’s common stock price increased 129 subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2020 furthermore based on our qualitative assessment as of october 31 2021 no impairment occurred in 2021

although our common stock price and commodity prices have increased significantly during 2021 we are subject to commodity price volatility a sustained period of depressed commodity prices would adversely affect our estimates of future operating results which could result in future goodwill impairments due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized

 

nongaap measures

core earnings

 

we make reference to “core earnings loss attributable to devon” and “core earnings loss per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2021 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap core earnings loss attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings loss excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our quarterly financial results for more information on the results of discontinued operations for our barnett shale assets and canadian operations see note 19 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure amounts excluded for 2021 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance changes in tax legislation fair value changes in derivative financial instruments costs associated with the early retirement of debt and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2021 

 

amounts excluded for 2020 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency change in tax legislation and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2020

 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

 

below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures 

 



 

 

 



ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin 

to assess the performance of our assets we use ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense financing costs net exploration expenses dda asset impairments asset disposition gains and losses noncash sharebased compensation noncash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items not related to our normal operations fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses production expenses consist of lease operating gathering processing and transportation expenses as well as production and property taxes

we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period dda and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred we exclude sharebased compensation valuation changes restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance 

we believe ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations 

 

below are reconciliations of net earnings to ebitdax and a further reconciliation to fieldlevel cash margin 

 



 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our gas and ngl production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2021 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2021 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net positions by approximately 195 million

 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2021 we had total debt of 65 billion all of our debt is based on fixed interest rates averaging 58

foreign currency risk

we had no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2021

our business strategy is focused on delivering a consistently competitive shareholder return among our peer group because the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive delivering sustainable capital efficient cash flow growth is a key tenant to our success while our cash flow is highly dependent on volatile and uncertain commodity prices we pursue our strategy throughout all commodity price cycles with four fundamental principles

proven and responsible operator – we operate our business with the interests of our stakeholders and our environmental social and governance values in mind with our vision to be a premier independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company the work our employees do every day contributes to the local national and global economies we produce a valuable commodity that is fundamental to society and we endeavor to do so in a safe environmentally responsible and ethical way while striving to deliver strong returns to our shareholders we have an ongoing commitment to transparency in reporting our environmental social and governance performance see our sustainability report published on our company website for performance highlights and additional information information contained in our sustainability report is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this annual report on form 10k 

premier sustainable portfolio of assets – as discussed later in this section of this annual report we own a portfolio of assets located in the united states we strive to own premier assets capable of generating cash flows in excess of our capital and operating requirements as well as competitive rates of return we also desire to own a portfolio of assets that can provide sustainable production extending many years into the future due to the strength of oil prices relative to natural gas we have positioned our portfolio to be more heavily weighted to us oil assets in recent years 

during 2019 we sold our canadian business generating 26 billion in proceeds during 2020 we sold our barnett shale assets generating proceeds of 490 million and contingent earnout payments to devon of up to 260 million based upon future commodity prices with upside participation beginning at a 275 henry hub natural gas price or a 50 wti oil price on january 7 2021 devon and wpx completed an allstock merger of equals wpx is an oil and gas exploration and production company with assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota as a result of these transactions our oil production price realizations and fieldlevel margins will all improve as we sharpen our focus on five us oil and liquids plays located in the delaware basin powder river basin anadarko basin williston basin and eagle ford 

superior execution – as we pursue cash flow growth we continually work to optimize the efficiency of our capital programs and production operations with an underlying objective of reducing absolute and per unit costs and enhancing our returns we also strive to leverage our culture of health safety and environmental stewardship in all aspects of our business 

with the wpx merger and continuous improvement initiatives we are building a scalable multibasin portfolio of us oil assets and aggressively improving our cost structure to further expand margins we have realized annualized cost savings by reducing well costs production expense financing costs and ga costs 

 

index to financial statements 

financial strength and flexibility – commodity prices are uncertain and volatile so we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet as well as adequate liquidity and financial flexibility in order to operate competitively in all commodity price cycles our capital allocation decisions are made with attention to these financial stewardship principles  as well as the priorities of funding our core operations protecting our investmentgrade credit ratings and paying and growing our shareholder dividend 

human capital

delivering strong operational and financial results in a safe environmentally and socially responsible way requires the expertise and positive contributions of every devon employee consequently our people are the company’s most important resource and we seek to hire the best people who share our core values of doing the right thing delivering results and being good team members and neighbors to our communities to develop our workforce we focus on training safety wellness inclusion diversity and equality as of december 31 2020 devon and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 1400 employees all located in the us

 

employee safety and wellness 

we prepare our workforce to work safely with comprehensive training and orientation onthejob guidance and tools safety engagements recognition and other resources employees and contractors are expected to comply with safety rules and regulations and are accountable to stopping atrisk work immediately reporting incidents and nearmiss events and informing visitors of emergency alarms and evacuation plans to safeguard workers on our well sites and neighbors nearby we plan design drill complete and produce wells using proven best practices technologies tools and materials

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have developed and implemented a number of safety measures to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities with a strong focus on employee wellbeing health and safety refer to “covid19” included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for information on actions taken by devon to protect and support its employees during the covid19 pandemic

beyond employee safety devon also prioritizes the physical mental and financial wellness of our employees we offer competitive health and financial benefits with incentives designed to promote wellbeing for example we encourage employees to take advantage of our wellness programs and activities by getting an annual physical exam or completing a financial wellness series at no cost to employees 

 

employee compensation benefits and development

we strive to attract and retain highperforming individuals across our workforce one way we do this is by providing competitive compensation and benefits including annual bonuses a 401k savings plan with a devon match stock awards medical dental and vision health care coverage health savings and dependentcare flexible spending accounts maternity and parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child an adoption assistance program alternate work schedules flexible work hours parttime work options telecommuting support among other benefits 

devon also looks to our core values to build the workforce we need we develop our employees’ knowledge and creativity and advance continual learning and career development through ongoing performance training and development conversations 

 

inclusion and diversity

devon’s success depends on employees who demonstrate integrity accountability perseverance and a passion for building our business and delivering results our efforts to create a workforce with these qualities start with offering equal opportunity in all aspects of employment we do this with employeeled organizations and corporate policies

we promote inclusion and diversity throughout the company to bring a range of thoughts experiences and points of view to our problemsolving and decisionmaking processes devon has an inclusion and diversity leadership team which consists of senior leaders who support others by coaching motivating and breaking down barriers the inclusion and diversity leadership team works together with devon’s allvolunteer inclusion action team to proactively increase diversity and inclusion awareness identify challenges and find innovative ways to achieve devon’s inclusion and diversity vision and strategy

all devon employees must act in accordance with our code of business conduct and ethics “code” which sets forth current business practices and guidance to ensure ongoing compliance our code covers topics such as anticorruption harassment discrimination privacy cybersecurity confidential information and how to report code violations on an annual basis devon employees are required to acknowledge and agree to abide by our code as well as complete a training course on the code and its related policies additionally our directors officers and employees are required to comply with policies such as our zero tolerance antiharassment policy anticorruption policy and procedure conflicts of interest policy and employee gifts and entertainment declaration policy

property profiles

key summary data from each of our areas of operation as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 are detailed in the map below

delaware basin – the delaware basin is devon’s most active program in the portfolio through capitalefficient drilling programs it offers exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich wolfcamp bone spring leonard and delaware formations with a significant inventory of oil and liquidsrich drilling opportunities that have multizone development potential devon has a robust platform to deliver highmargin drilling programs for many years to come at december 31 2020 we had eight operated rigs developing this asset in the wolfcamp and bone spring formations combined with the delaware basin assets acquired in the wpx merger we plan to invest approximately 15 billion of capital in the delaware basin in 2021 making it the topfunded asset in the portfolio 

powder river basin – this asset is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin devon is currently targeting several cretaceous oil objectives including the turner parkman teapot and niobrara formations recent drilling success in this basin has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we accelerate activity and continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity devon has several uncompleted wells in its powder river basin inventory and has resumed capital activity in early 2021 in 2021 we plan approximately 80 million of capital investment 

eagle ford – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in 2014 since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results driven by our development in dewitt county texas located in the economic core of the play our eagle ford production is leveraged to oil and has lowcost access to premium gulf coast pricing providing for solid operating margins as a result of the covid19 pandemic and related significant decrease to oil pricing in early 2020 devon did not pursue any drilling and completion 

 

index to financial statements 

activity in the latter half of 2020 for these assets devon has several uncompleted wells in its eagle ford inventory and has resumed capital activity in early 2021  in 2021 we plan approximately  11 0 million of capital investment 

anadarko basin  – our anadarko basin development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties provides longterm optionality through its significant inventory our anadarko basin position is one of the largest in the industry providing visible longterm production at the end of 2019 we announced an agreement with dow to jointly develop a portion of our anadarko basin acreage this joint venture activity was delayed in response to the challenged macroeconomic environment resulting from the covid pandemic however due to improvements in natural gas pricing the joint venture has commenced in the first quarter of 2021 with a two operated rig program dow will fund approximately 65 of the partnership capital requirements through a drilling carry of 100 million over the next four years in 2021 we plan approximately 75 million of capital investment net to devon 

proved reserves

 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time we establish our proved reserves estimates using standard geological and engineering technologies and computational methods which are generally accepted by the petroleum industry we primarily prepare our proved reserves additions by analogy using type curves that are based on decline curve analysis of wells in analogous reservoirs we further establish reasonable certainty of our proved reserves estimates by using one or more of the following methods geological and geophysical information to establish reservoir continuity between penetrations ratetransient analysis analytical and numerical simulations or other proprietary technical and statistical methods for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 22 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves in compliance with applicable sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates and are independent of the operating groups the director of the group has over 30 years of industry experience a degree in engineering and is a registered professional engineer the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2020 we engaged laroche petroleum consultants ltd to audit approximately 88 of our proved reserves additionally we have a reserves committee that provides additional oversight of our reserves process the committee consists of five independent members of our board of directors with education or business backgrounds relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the following tables present production price and cost information for each significant field in our asset portfolio and the total company

drilling statistics

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results

 



 



as of december 31 2020 there were 156 gross and 776 net wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling completing or waiting on completion to effectively manage capital expenditures and provide flexibility in managing drilling rig and well completion schedules we have a large inventory of drilled but not completed wells gross wells are the sum of all wells in which we own a working interest net wells are gross wells multiplied by our fractional working interests in each well

productive wells

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2020 



 







the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 3942 gross wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing drilling and construction overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of ga which is a common industry practice

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2020 of our 18 million net acres approximately 10 million acres are held by production the acreage in the table includes approximately 01 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2021 2022 and 2023 of the 01 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2023 we anticipate performing operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business subsequent to our merger with wpx less than 20 of our total net acres are located on federal lands

 



 





title to properties

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry a preliminary title investigation typically consisting of a review of local title records is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties more thorough title investigations which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside legal counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

marketing activities

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2021 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 



 

index to financial statements 

 

 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2020 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

competition

see “item 1a risk factors”

public policy and government regulation

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations

exploration and production regulation

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include



























 

index to financial statements 

 

our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members moreover the permitting process for oil and gas activities on federal lands can sometimes be subject to delay which can stall development activities or otherwise adversely impact operations the federal government has from time to time evaluated and in some cases promulgated new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands in addition president biden and certain members of his administration have expressed support for and have taken steps to implement additional restrictions on oil and gas activities on federal lands including orders temporarily limiting the approval of new leases and drilling permits to certain highranking officials within the department of the interior as well as a pause on entering into future oil and gas leases on public lands

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations

we strive to conduct our operations in a socially and environmentally responsible manner which includes compliance with applicable law we are subject to many federal state and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment and natural resources environmental laws and regulations relate to



















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which can allow environmental organizations to sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law environmental organizations also can assert legal and administrative challenges to certain actions of oil and gas regulators such as the blm for allegedly failing to comply with environmental laws which can result in delays in obtaining permits or other necessary authorizations environmental protection and health and safety compliance are necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws and permitting requirements our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently 

 

index to financial statements 

believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example over the last five years monthly nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub gas prices ranged from highs of over 67 per bbl and 480 per mmbtu respectively to lows of under 30 per bbl and 150 per mmbtu respectively such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to































our business has been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we may experience continuing or worsening adverse effects from this or other pandemics

the covid19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry this outbreak and the related responses of governmental authorities and others to limit the spread of the virus significantly reduced global economic activity resulting in an unprecedented decline in the demand for oil and other commodities during 2020 combined with other factors this decline in demand caused a swift and material deterioration in commodity prices in early 2020 which adversely impacted our results of operations for 2020 and contributed to our recognition of a material asset impairment to our oil and gas assets during the first quarter of 2020 the negative effects of covid19 on economic prospects across the world have contributed to concerns for the potential of a prolonged economic slowdown and recession any such downturns or protracted periods of depressed commodity prices could have significant adverse consequences for our financial condition and liquidity moreover any such downturns could also result in similar financial constraints for our nonoperating partners purchasers of our production and other counterparties thereby increasing the risk that such counterparties default on their obligations to us such defaults or more general supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic may also jeopardize the supply of materials equipment or services for our operations 

the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions aimed at mitigating its spread have caused us to modify certain of our business practices including limiting employee travel encouraging workfromhome practices and other social distancing measures there is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease including the risk of infection of key employees and our ability to perform certain functions could be disrupted or otherwise impaired by these new 

 

index to financial statements 

business practices for example our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to our encouragement of remote communications and other workfromhome practices which could make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks 

the covid19 pandemic and its related effects continue to evolve the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and any other future pandemic on our business will depend on future developments including but not limited to the nature duration and spread of the disease the vaccination and other responsive actions to stop its spread or address its effects and the duration timing and severity of the related consequences on commodity prices and the economy more generally including any recession resulting from the pandemic any extended period of depressed commodity prices or general economic disruption as a result of a pandemic would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development and appraisal activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors moreover our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business

our operations are subject to extensive federal state local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators including corporate successors of former operators these requirements may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions

in addition changes in public policy have affected and in the future could further affect our operations for example president biden and certain members of his administration and congress have expressed support for and have taken steps to implement efforts to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and to promote stricter environmental regulations and such proposals could impose new and more onerous burdens on our industry and business these and other regulatory and public policy developments could among other things restrict production levels delay necessary permitting impose price controls change environmental protection requirements impose restrictions on pipelines or other necessary infrastructure and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations in addition changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by among other things increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and 

 

index to financial statements 

fostering general economic uncertainty although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to leasing and permitting on federal lands hydraulic fracturing environmental matters more generally seismic activity and income taxes as discussed below 

federal lands – president biden and certain members of his administration have expressed support for and have taken steps to implement additional regulation of oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands such proposals range from more onerous permitting requirements to an outright moratorium on new oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands for example on january 20 2021 the acting secretary of the department of the interior issued an order temporarily limiting the authority to approve certain fossil fuel authorizations on federal lands including the approval of new leases and new drilling permits to certain highranking officials within the department of the interior in addition president biden issued an executive order on january 27 2021 directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering new oil and gas leases on public lands to the extent possible and to launch a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands while it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these or any other future regulatory changes any additional restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to operate on federal lands could adversely impact our business in the delaware and powder river basins as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases postmerger less than 20 of our total leasehold resides on federal lands primarily located in the delaware and powder river basins 

hydraulic fracturing – in recent years various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process for example the epa has issued regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and it finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a report in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources in certain circumstances the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017 moreover several states in which we operate have adopted or stated intentions to adopt laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing imposing more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing in addition to state laws local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular 

beyond these regulatory efforts various policy makers regulatory agencies and political leaders at the federal state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing including prohibiting the technology outright although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations

environmental laws generally – in addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing we are subject to various other federal state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations or prior operations on assets we have acquired environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

seismic activity – earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma southeastern new mexico western texas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate or previously operated income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions such as 

 

index to financial statements 

intangible drilling costs and the timing of such deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow 

concerns about climate change and related regulatory social and market actions may adversely affect our business

continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative regulatory and other initiatives including international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane policy makers and regulators at both the us federal and state levels have already imposed or stated intentions to impose laws and regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases for example both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry although the methane specific requirements of some of these regulations have been repealed similar or more stringent emissions requirements may be imposed by the biden administration in addition several states where we operate including wyoming new mexico and texas have already imposed or stated intentions to impose laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities with respect to more comprehensive regulation policy makers and political leaders have made or expressed support for a variety of proposals such as the development of capandtrade or carbon tax programs in addition president biden has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration and he previously released an energy plan calling for a number of sweeping changes to address climate change including among other measures a national mobilization effort to achieve netzero emissions for the us economy by 2050 through increased use of renewable power stricter fuelefficiency standards and support for zeroemission vehicles president biden issued a number of executive orders in january 2021 with the purpose of implementing certain of these changes including the rejoining of the paris agreement a call for the issuance of more stringent methane emissions regulations for oil and gas facilities and an order directing federal agencies to procure electric vehicles although the full impact of these orders is uncertain at this time the adoption and implementation of these or other initiatives may result in the restriction or cancellation of oil and natural gas activities greater costs of compliance or consumption thereby reducing demand for our products or an impairment in our ability to continue our operations in an economic manner

in addition to regulatory risk other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business for example in an effort to promote a lowercarbon economy there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbonbased fuels such as oil and gas moreover an increasing number of financial institutions funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations finally governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought and may continue to bring claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change these and the other regulatory social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have an adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity

our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks

our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to







 

index to financial statements 













the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property as well as significant liabilities moreover certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant damage to property and natural resources for example we have from time to time experienced wellcontrol events that have resulted in various remediation and cleanup costs and certain of the other impacts described above

in addition we rely on our employees consultants and subcontractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals whether through negligence harassment discrimination or other misconduct could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business for example negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury death or property damage and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts moreover as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation and regulation hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements 

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective share of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities including contingent liabilities owed to and assumed from us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities which could adversely impact our financial results and condition

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us 

as of december 31 2020 we had total indebtedness of 43 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned asset sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding the use of these technologies in our operations including through artificial intelligence process automation and data analytics concurrent with the growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyber attack related activities which have increasingly targeted our industry cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating confidential and proprietary information intellectual property or financial assets corrupting data or causing operational disruptions as well as preventing users from accessing systems or information for the purpose of demanding payment in order for users to regain access these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders techniques used in these attacks often range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be performed in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks in addition our vendors midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which in turn could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences including litigation risks moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities 

we have limited control over properties operated by others

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales

we rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

 

index to financial statements 

insurance does not cover all risks 

as discussed above our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development and production of oil gas and ngls to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks including pollution events that are considered gradual war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic longterm positions and relationships including with respect to midstream takeaway capacity as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations

our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change

stockholder activism has been increasing in our industry and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by stockholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business such perceived uncertainty may in turn make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to







in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

the ultimate success of the merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine the legacy devon and wpx businesses in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and benefits if we are not able to successfully achieve these synergies or the cost to achieve these synergies is greater than expected then the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the loss of customers the disruption of our ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall post‑completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated furthermore our board of directors and management team consist of directors and employees from each of the legacy companies the integration of these individuals could require the reconciliation of differing priorities and strategic philosophies which may not be successful or take longer than anticipated

covid – 19 

a novel strain of coronavirus sarscov2 causing a disease referred to as covid19 was reported to have surfaced in china in late 2019 and has subsequently spread worldwide resulting in a global pandemic and health crisis devon began actively monitoring covid19 in january 2020 and formally established a covid19 crossfunctional planning team at the beginning of march the covid19 team is focused on two key priorities the health and safety of our employees and contractors and the uninterrupted operation of our business 

 



 



 

this outbreak and the related responses of governmental authorities and others to limit the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity resulting in an unprecedented decline in the demand for oil and other commodities this supplyanddemand imbalance was exacerbated by uncertainty regarding the future global supply of oil due to disputes between russia and the members of opec in march 2020 these factors caused a swift and material deterioration in commodity prices in early 2020 with nymex wti oil prices falling from a high of over 60bbl at the beginning of the year to below 20bbl in april 2020 by the end of 2020 nymex wti oil prices recovered to approximately 50bbl and we expect oil and other commodity prices to remain volatile for the foreseeable future

overview of 2020 results 

 

driven by the coronavirus pandemic 2020 was a challenging year for the oil and gas industry and our business social distancing restrictions government lockdowns and individual behavior changes all reduced transportation needs which negatively impacted the demand for oil the resulting drop in oil prices and cash generated from our operations necessitated a change in our plans we aggressively reduced our planned capital investment 45 selectively curtailed production and initiated sustainable costreduction measures despite these challenges we continued to improve our capital efficiency and controllable costs per unit of production importantly we maintained competitive leverage and debt metrics

 

these market forces led to opportunities for select companies in our industry to create shareholder value from mergers and acquisitions and on september 26 2020 we entered into the merger agreement providing for an allstock merger of equals with wpx which successfully closed on january 7 2021 the merger has created a leading oil producer in the us with an asset base underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the delaware basin this strategic combination accelerates our transition to a cashreturn business model including the implementation of a fixed plus variable dividend strategy 

 

as evidenced by our recent performance highlights below we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of disciplined oil volume growth while cutting operational and corporate costs reducing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow maintaining low leverage delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing esg excellence as we capture synergies and other benefits from the merger we expect to improve across all these performance measures

trends of our annual earnings operating cash flow ebitdax and capital expenditures are shown below the annual earnings chart presents amounts pertaining to both devon’s continuing and discontinued operations the annual cash flow chart presents amounts pertaining to devon’s continuing operations “core earnings” and “ebitdax” are financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap for a description of these measures including reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures see “nongaap measures” in this item 7  

 

 

our net earnings in recent years have been significantly impacted by divestiture transactions asset impairments and temporary noncash adjustments to the value of our commodity hedges net earnings in 2018 included a 22 billion gain on our enlink disposition a 05 billion hedge valuation gain and a 02 billion gain on asset dispositions from continuing operations all net of taxes net earnings in 2019 included a 04 billion hedge valuation loss 02 billion net gains and charges related to our canadian disposition and a 06 billion asset impairment related to our barnett shale disposition all net of taxes net earnings in 2020 included 23 billion of asset impairments on our proved and unproved properties and a 01 billion hedge valuation loss both net of taxes excluding these amounts our core earnings have been more stable over recent years but continue to be heavily influenced by commodity prices 

 

 

index to financial statements 

 

despite our portfolio enhancements aggressive cost reductions and operational advancements our 2020 financial results were challenged by commodity prices and deterioration of the macroeconomic environment resulting from the unprecedented covid19 pandemic our earnings decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to a decline in overall commodity prices led by a 31 decline in wti from 2019 to 2020 our unhedged combined realized price decreased 31 while our hedged price decreased 26 in response to this commodity price environment we reduced our aggregate production and ga expenses 13 compared to 2019

 

 

like earnings our operating cash flow is sensitive to volatile commodity prices ebitdax which excludes financial amounts related to discontinued operations and operating cash flow continue to be impacted from the covid19 pandemic and declines in commodity prices as operating cash flow has declined we reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 800 million or 45 compared to the original capital budget 

 

as of december 31 2020 we had 52 billion of liquidity comprised of 22 billion of cash and 30 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility we had 43 billion of debt outstanding with no maturities until the end of 2025 postmerger approximately 50 and 55 of our 2021 oil and gas production is hedged respectively these contracts consist of a variety of trade types based off the wti oil benchmark and the henry hub natural gas index additionally we have entered into regional basis swaps in an effort to protect price realizations across our portfolio

business and industry outlook

 

in 2020 devon marked its 49th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 32nd year as a public company due to our financial strength our strong leadership team and our portfolio of quality assets during 2020 we were able to successfully navigate through periods of commodity price volatility and economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 global pandemic we also announced a transformational merger of equals with wpx that nearly doubles the size and scale of devon’s oil production while further strengthening the quality of our portfolio of assets without deteriorating our balance sheet strength the transaction was completed on january 7 2021 

with the combination of the devon and wpx leadership teams and respective portfolios of quality assets we expect to build on our successful track record of delivering value for our shareholders while remaining committed to safeguarding our longterm financial strength with the transaction devon creates a leading position in the delaware basin while also adding the oily williston basin to our portfolio of assets looking forward the strategic combination with wpx accelerates our planned cash return business model that includes targeted capital reinvestment rates of 70 to 80 percent of operating cash flow and a disciplined returnsdriven strategy to generate higher free cash flow our strategy is underpinned by the maintenance of a disciplined oil growth target of up to 5 percent annually while achieving margin growth through operational and corporate cost reductions we expect to prioritize the deployment of our free cash flow toward maintaining a strong balance sheet through debt reduction and returning excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends using our innovative fixed plus variable dividend framework 

our disciplined growth strategy is in response to current market fundamentals that indicate a slow recovery in global oil demand along with market prices for crude oil and natural gas that remain inherently volatile in 2020 wti oil prices averaged 3959 per barrel versus 5702 per barrel in 2019 crude prices experienced tremendous volatility in 2020 with a geopolitical price war in march followed by a steep decline in global oil demand related to the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns looking ahead current market fundamentals indicate that 2021 crude pricing is expected to improve supported by a slow recovery in demand with the easing of lockdown measures the rollout of covid19 vaccines and declines in shale production these factors indicate a balanced market by the second half of 2021 however uncertainty still exists depending on actions taken by opec countries in supporting a balanced global crude supply natural gas and ngl prices also faced strong headwinds in early 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic as lockdowns negatively impacted demand during the summer of 2020 us gas prices were pressured by us liquefied natural gas export cancellations from decreased global demand outlook looking forward gas and ngl prices have improved due to declines in associated gas volumes and strong recovery in global demand

to mitigate our exposure to commodity market volatility and ensure our financial strength we continue to execute a disciplined riskmanagement hedging program our hedging program incorporates both systematic hedges added on a regular basis and discretionary hedges layered in on an opportunistic basis to take advantage of favorable market conditions we are currently adding 2021 hedge positions at desirable prices where postmerger we currently have approximately 50 of our anticipated oil volumes and 55 of our anticipated gas volumes hedged we are also actively adding attractive hedges for 2022 further insulating our cash flow we continue to examine and when appropriate execute attractive regional basis swap hedges to protect price realizations across our portfolio 

in connection with the merger we announced expected annual cost savings and margin improvements of 575 million including legacy devon cost reductions already underway and additional synergies expected through the integration of the wpx business with that of devon with our 2021 capital program we expect to continue our capitalefficiency focus and our steadfast commitment to capital discipline to achieve our 2021 capital program objectives that maximize free cash flow over 70 percent of our 2021 spend will be focused on our highest margin us oil play the delaware basin we expect to continue to leverage the strengths of our multibasin strategy and deploy the remainder of our 2021 capital in our remaining core areas of the eagle ford anadarko basin powder river basin and williston basin in total our 2021 operating plan is expected to maintain our oil production at similar levels as 2020 on a pro forma combined basis

index to financial statements 

 

production volumes

 



 



 



 



 

from 2019 to 2020 a 2 increase in production volumes contributed to a 116 million increase in earnings continued development in the delaware basin and powder river basin resulted in higher production volumes during 2020 compared to 2019 these increases were partially offset by significantly lower activity in the anadarko basin additionally 2020 capital expenditures were reduced by 45 in response to the challenged macroeconomic environment negatively impacting volumes across the portfolio 

 

due to the merger and increased activity across our portfolio we expect volumes to increase in 2021 and range from approximately 543 to 580 mboed 

 

field prices

 



 



 



 

  



 

from 2019 to 2020 field prices contributed to a 12 billion decrease in earnings unhedged realized oil gas and ngl prices decreased primarily due to lower wti henry hub and mont belvieu index prices these decreases were partially offset by favorable hedge cash settlements across each of our products

production expenses

 



 

gathering processing and transportation costs increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher volumes and anadarko volume commitments which expired at the end of 2020 these increases were offset by lower production taxes resulting from lower oil gas and ngl sales additionally loe costs decreased due to reduced activity levels and cost saving initiatives resulting from the challenged macroeconomic environment 

 

due to the merger and increased activity across our portfolio we expect 2021 production expenses to be approximately 2 billion 

 

fieldlevel cash margin

 

the table below presents the fieldlevel cash margin for each of our operating areas fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses and is not prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation to the comparable gaap measures is found in “nongaap measures” in this item 7 the changes in production volumes field prices and production expenses shown above had the following impacts on our fieldlevel cash margins by asset

asset impairments were 27 billion in 2020 due to significant decreases in commodity prices since the end of 2019 resulting primarily from the covid19 pandemic for additional information see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

dda decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower rates resulting from impairments recorded in the first quarter of 2020

 

general and administrative expense

 



labor and benefits and nonlabor expenses decreased 137 million primarily as a result of continued workforce reductions and cost savings initiatives for additional information on the workforce reductions see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

subsequent to the merger we expect 2021 general and administrative expense to range from approximately 400 to 420 million

we recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationship between contract prices and the associated forward curves

marketing and midstream operations decreased 88 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower commodity prices resulting from the challenged macroeconomic environment as well as downstream product inventory impairments of 17 million recognized in 2020 

exploration expense increased 109 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to   recognizing 152 million in unproved asset   impairments in 2020 compared to 18 million in 2019

restructuring and transaction costs in 2020 and 2019 primarily relate to workforce reductions and the associated employee severance benefits related to announced cost reduction plans restructuring and transaction costs in 2020 also included approximately 8 million of transaction costs associated with the merger we expect to incur additional restructuring and transaction costs in 2021 related to the merger of approximately 160 million to 200 million these costs primarily relate to planned workforce reductions and the associated employee severance benefits costs to modify or abandon vendor contracts and the acceleration of certain employee benefits triggered by the merger

the table below presents key components from discontinued operations for the time periods presented discontinued operations include the canadian business that devon sold in june 2019 and also the barnett shale assets that devon sold in october 2020 for additional information on discontinued operations see note 19   in “part i financial information – item 1 financial statements” of this report 

 



 

 

net earnings loss from discontinued operations net of tax increased approximately 146 million this change is primarily due to the timing of devon’s completion of its divestiture of its canadian business in the second quarter of 2019 as well as the closing of the barnett shale divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2020 during 2019 devon recognized a 223 million gain on the sale of its canadian operations as well as income tax benefits of 216 million and 142 million related to its canadian business and barnett shale properties respectively these increases were largely offset by a decrease attributable to a proved oil and gas property impairment of approximately 748 million related to the barnett shale in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the timing of the completion of these divestitures there was minimal activity of a comparable nature during 2020

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties our capital program is designed to operate within or near operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow this is evidenced by our operating cash flow fully funding capital expenditures in 2020 and 2019 our capital expenditures are lower in 2020 primarily due to a 45 reduction in capital spend in response to the covid19 pandemic and the associated macroeconomic implications

debt activity net

during 2019 our debt decreased 162 million due to the repayment of our 630 senior notes at maturity 

 

repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions

we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock for 38 million in 2020 and 686 million shares of common stock for 18 billion in 2019 under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors for additional information see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report 

devon paid common stock dividends of 257 million and 140 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively dividends paid on common stock during 2020 include a 026 special dividend paid to shareholders on october 1 2020 which totaled 97 million beginning with the second quarter of 2020 we increased our quarterly dividend 22 to 011 per share we previously increased our quarterly dividend to 009 per share commencing with the second quarter of 2019 for additional information see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

contributions from noncontrolling interests

during 2020 and 2019 we received approximately 21 million and 116 million respectively in cash contributions from our partner in cdm 

 

distributions to noncontrolling interests

during 2020 we paid approximately 14 million in cash distributions to our partner in cdm 

cash flows from discontinued operations

all cash flows in the following table relate to activities from discontinued operations for the time periods presented discontinued operations include our canadian business that devon sold in june 2019 and the barnett shale assets that devon divested in october 2020

 



operating cash flow in 2020 decreased 138 million as a result of the divestitures referenced above and cash taxes paid related to divested canadian operations

 

index to financial statements 

 

on october 1 2020 devon completed the sale of its barnett shale assets for proceeds net of purchase price adjustments of 490 million on june 27 2019 devon completed the sale of substantially all its oil and gas assets and operations in canada for proceeds of 26 billion

cash flows from financing activities includes the 15 billion of senior notes retired prior to maturity in 2019

liquidity

the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive because oil natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource we like all upstream operators must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production generally our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells at opportunistic times we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets 

on january 7 2021 devon and wpx completed an allstock merger of equals wpx is an oil and gas exploration and production company with assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota on the closing date of the merger each share of wpx common stock was automatically converted into the right to receive 05165 of a share of devon common stock based on the closing price of devon’s common stock on january 7 2021 the total value of the devon common stock issued to holders of wpx common stock as part of this transaction was approximately 54 billion for additional information please see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

with this strategic merger we are accelerating our transition to a cashreturn business model which moderates growth emphasizes capital efficiencies and prioritizes cash returns to shareholders these principles will position devon to be a consistent builder of economic value through the cycle the postmerger scalability is expected to enhance devon’s free cash flow credit profile and decrease the overall cost of capital

historically our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances if needed we can also issue debt and equity securities including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned postmerger capital requirements as discussed in this section as well as accelerate our cashreturn business model

operating cash flow

key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years at the end of 2020 we held approximately 22 billion of cash inclusive of 190 million of cash restricted for retained obligations related to divested assets our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables may differ from our expectations 

commodity prices – the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce and sell prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk we hedge our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2020 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

further when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities additionally as commodity prices begin to recover from the covid19 pandemic we remain committed to a maintenance capital program for the foreseeable future we do not intend to add any growth projects until market fundamentals recover excess inventory clears up and opec curtailed volumes are effectively absorbed by the world markets

 

index to financial statements 

operating expenses – commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices 

cost savings from 2020 initiatives and synergies resulting from the merger are expected to be attained through cost reductions and efficiencies related to our capital programs ga financing costs and production expenses we anticipate the planned 575 million reduction of annualized costs will occur by yearend 2021 approximately 35 of the reduced costs are related to our capital programs and the remainder relate to our operating expenses including ga interest expense and production expenses

restructuring and transaction related costs – mergerrelated restructuring and transaction costs cash outflows are expected to range from 220 million to 255 million these payments will relate to workforce reductions and the associated employee severance benefits costs to modify or abandon vendor contracts and the acceleration of certain employee benefits triggered by the merger 

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from our joint interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

assumption and repayment of wpx debt

in february 2021 devon redeemed bonds issued by wpx with a maturity date of 2022 pursuant to a make whole call provision in the related indenture the total principal related to this redemption was approximately 43 million with an additional 2 million cash premium paid to complete the make whole redemption 

in conjunction with the merger closing on january 7 2021 devon is assuming a principal value of 33 billion of wpx debt 

credit availability

we have 30 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31 2020 the senior credit facility matures on october 5 2024 with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional oneyear periods subject to lender consent subsequent to october 5 2023 the borrowing capacity decreases to 28 billion the senior credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 14 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with this covenant with a 25 debttocapitalization ratio

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness 

 

index to financial statements 

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s financial services is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from fitch is bbb with a positive outlook our credit rating from moody’s investor service is ba1 with a stable outlook any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

fixed plus variable dividend

 

following the closing of the merger devon initiated a new “fixed plus variable” dividend strategy the fixed dividend is currently paid quarterly at a rate of 011 per share and the board of directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend if any including a general target of paying out approximately 10 of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend devon may pay a variable dividend up to 50 percent of its excess free cash flow which is a nongaap measure each quarter’s excess free cash flow is computed as operating cash flow a gaap measure before balance sheet changes less capital expenditures and the fixed dividend the declaration and payment of any future dividend whether fixed or variable will remain at the full discretion of our board of directors and will depend on devon’s financial results cash requirements future prospects covid19 impacts and other factors deemed relevant by the board

 

in february 2021 devon announced an approximately 128 million variable cash dividend in the amount of 019 per share payable in the first quarter of 2021 the variable dividend is in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend of 011 per share 

capital expenditures

our 2021 postmerger exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately 16 billion to 18 billion

contractual obligations

as of december 31 2020 our material contractual obligations include debt interest expense asset retirement obligations lease obligations retained obligations related to our barnett shale assets and canadian business operational agreements drilling and facility obligations and various tax obligations as discussed above we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our short and longterm contractual obligations including the obligations we assumed through the merger see notes 6  8  14  15  16 and 20 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

 

index to financial statements 

 

oil and gas assets accounting classification reserves  valuation

successful efforts method of accounting and classification 

we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize then subject to dda calculations and impairment assessments and valuations

 

once a well is drilled the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience development wells are always capitalized costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed when making this determination management considers current activities nearterm plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized at december 31 2020 all suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year

 

similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs costs for undeveloped leasehold for which reserves have not been proven must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment at the end of each quarter management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans drilling activity results commodity price outlooks planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects at december 31 2020 devon had approximately 82 million of undeveloped leasehold of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31 2020 approximately 1 million is scheduled to expire in 2021 the leasehold expiring in 2021 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling if our drilling is not successful this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired 

 

reserves

our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dda calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a thirdparty petroleum consulting firm in 2020 88 of our reserves were subjected to such an audit

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

valuation of longlived assets

longlived assets used in operations including proved and unproved oil and gas properties are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group for dda calculations and impairment assessments management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level “common operating field” for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition which requires judgment management also considers the nature of production common infrastructure common sales points common processing plants common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations these determinations impact the amount of dda recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment

 

index to financial statements 

management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes commodity prices operating costs and capital investment plans considering all available information at the date of review the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and riskadjusted proved undeveloped probable and possible reserves 

besides the riskadjusted estimates of reserves and future production volumes future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pretax cash flows for our impairment determinations we historically have utilized nymex forward strip prices for the first five years and applied internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years in response to the covid19 pandemic the nymex forward market became highly illiquid as evidenced by materially reduced trading volumes for periods beyond 2021 therefore we altered our price forecast assumptions to perform our march 31 2020 impairment computations specifically we supplemented the nymex forward strip prices with price forecasts published by reputable investment banks and reservoir engineering firms to estimate our future revenues as of march 31 2020

we also estimate and escalate or deescalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history to measure indicated impairments we use a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital to discount the future net cash flows changes to any of the reserves or marketbased assumptions can significantly affect estimates of undiscounted and discounted pretax cash flows and impact the recognition and amount of impairments

reduced demand from the covid19 pandemic and management of production levels from opec caused wti pricing to decrease more than 60 during the first quarter of 2020 as a result we reduced our planned 2020 capital investment 45 with materially lower commodity prices and reduced nearterm investment we assessed all our oil and gas fields for impairment as of march 31 2020 and recognized proved and unproved impairments totaling 28 billion the impairments relate to our anadarko basin and rockies fields in which our basis included acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015 respectively when commodity prices were much higher than they are today

we assessed our eagle ford asset for impairment as of june 30 2020 and september 30 2020 utilizing the same methodology we applied for the impairment assessments for all of our and oil and gas fields in the first quarter of 2020 our eagle ford asset’s sum of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value indicating no impairment as of september 30 2020 further as a result of improved oil pricing the cushion increased significantly from march 31 2020 to december 31 2020 if prices significantly deteriorate andor management lowers the planned capital investment in the eagle ford field our eagle ford asset could be subject to a material impairment of capitalized costs

income taxes

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to an unprecedented downturn in the commodity price environment and the resulting asset impairments devon had significant deferred tax assets at march 31 2020 accordingly we reassessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets in future periods and recorded a 100 valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets during the first quarter of 2020 as of december 31 2020 we remain in a full valuation allowance position

further in the event we were to undergo an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited generally an “ownership change” occurs if one or more shareholders each of whom owns five percent or more in value of a corporation’s stock increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage of stock owned 

 

index to financial statements 

by those shareholders at any time during the preceding threeyear period see note 8 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for further discussion regarding our net operating losses and tax credits available to be carried forward and used in future years no ownership change occurred during 2020 for devon  the merger did cause an ownership change for wpx and increased the likelihood devon could experience an ownership change over the next three years 

goodwill

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount as part of our qualitative assessment we considered the general macroeconomic industry and market conditions changes in cost factors actual and expected financial performance significant changes in management strategy or customers and stock performance if the qualitative assessment determines that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required then the fair value is compared to the carrying value if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value because quoted market prices are not available the fair value is estimated based upon a valuation analyses including comparable companies and transactions and premiums paid 

because the trading price of our common stock decreased 73 during the first quarter of 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we performed a goodwill impairment test as of march 31 2020 while the cushion narrowed significantly since the previous impairment evaluation we concluded an impairment was not required as of march 31 2020 the two most critical judgements included in the march 31 2020 test were the period utilized to determine devon’s market capitalization and the control premium for the test performed as of march 31 2020 we derived our market capitalization by using our average common stock price from the latter two thirds of march 2020 to align with the time in the quarter subsequent to a key opec meeting and the date covid19 was officially classified as a pandemic we applied a control premium based on recent comparable market transactions

subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2020 devon’s common stock price increased approximately 129 during the remainder of 2020 but remains less than our average trading price before the events experienced in the first quarter of 2020 although our common stock price and commodity prices are in a period of high volatility a sustained period of depressed commodity prices would adversely affect our estimates of future operating results which could result in future goodwill impairments due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized

nongaap measures 

core earnings

 

we make reference to “core earnings loss attributable to devon” and “core earnings loss per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2020 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap core earnings loss attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results for more information on the results of discontinued operations for our barnett shale assets canadian operations and for enlink and the general partner see note 19 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure amounts excluded for 2020 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency change in tax legislation and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2020 

 

amounts excluded for 2019 relate to asset dispositions the gain on the sale of canadian operations noncash asset impairments including noncash barnett shale and unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance costs associated with early retirement of debt fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2019 and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the divestment of our canadian operations in 2019

 

amounts excluded for 2018 relate to asset dispositions the gain on the sale of devon’s aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance costs associated with early retirement of debt fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency  restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2018 

 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin 

to assess the performance of our assets we use ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense financing costs net exploration expenses dda asset impairments asset disposition gains and losses noncash sharebased compensation noncash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items not related to our normal operations fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses production expenses consist of lease operating gathering processing and transportation expenses as well as production and property taxes

we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period dda and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred we exclude sharebased compensation valuation changes restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance 

we believe ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our gas and ngl production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2020 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2020 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net liability positions by approximately 118 million

 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2020 we had total debt of 43 billion all of our debt is based on fixed interest rates averaging 60

foreign currency risk

devon has certain canadian dollar obligations associated with its divested canadian operations which are to be paid with the cash restricted for retained obligations these balances are remeasured using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2020 balance sheet for these items see note 19 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for additional information

 item 9a controls and procedure s

disclosure controls and procedures

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to devon including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors

based on their evaluation our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 were effective as of december 31 2020 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by devon in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for devon as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 under the supervision and with the participation of devon’s management including our principal executive and principal financial officers we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “2013 coso framework” based on this evaluation under the 2013 coso framework which was completed on february 17 2021 management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 as stated in their report which is included under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting




 item 9b other information 

on december 30 2020 devon held a special meeting of stockholders the “meeting” to consider and approve the issuance of shares of devon common stock in the merger the “stock issuance” more than 70 of the outstanding shares of devon common stock were present at the meeting and over 99 of the votes cast were in favor of approval of the stock issuance during the weeks following the closing of the merger devon learned that several stockholders had received their proxy materials for the meeting after the date of the meeting upon investigation devon learned that while the electronic distribution of proxy materials to stockholders had been timely completed certain stockholders who were to receive proxy materials by mail had not timely received those materials the company retained by devon to process and distribute proxy materials for the meeting has indicated that contrary to prior communication on the subject certain of the proxy materials were not timely delivered to the us postal service resulting in late delivery of such proxy materials to the holders of less than 15 of the outstanding shares of devon common stock including record holders of approximately 055 of the outstanding

our strategy

our business strategy is focused on delivering a consistently competitive shareholder return among our peer group because the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive delivering sustainable capital efficient cash flow growth is a key tenant to our success while our cash flow is highly dependent on volatile and uncertain commodity prices we pursue our strategy throughout all commodity price cycles with four fundamental principles

proven and responsible operator – we operate our business with the interests of our stakeholders and our environmental social and governance progress in mind with our vision to be a premier independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company the work our employees do every day contributes to the local national and global economies we produce a valuable commodity that is fundamental to society and we endeavor to do so in a safe environmentally responsible and ethical way while striving to deliver strong returns to our shareholders we have an ongoing commitment to transparency in reporting our environmental social and governance performance see our sustainability report published on our company website for performance highlights and additional information information contained in our sustainability report is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this annual report on form 10k 

a premier sustainable portfolio of assets – as discussed in the next section of this annual report we own a portfolio of assets located in the united states we strive to own premier assets capable of generating cash flows in excess of our capital and operating requirements as well as competitive rates of return we also desire to own a portfolio of assets that can provide a production growth platform extending many years into the future due to the strength of oil prices relative to natural gas we have been positioning our portfolio to be more heavily weighted to us oil assets in recent years 

during 2019 we completed our transition to a us oil company we sold our canadian business generating 26 billion in proceeds and announced the sale of our barnett shale assets for approximately 770 million before purchase price adjustments as a result of these divestitures we expect our oil production growth price realizations and fieldlevel margins will all improve as we sharpen our focus on four us oil plays located in the delaware basin stack powder river basin and eagle ford

superior execution – as we pursue cash flow growth we continually work to optimize the efficiency of our capital programs and production operations with an underlying objective of reducing absolute and per unit costs and enhancing our returns we also strive to leverage our culture of health safety and environmental stewardship in all aspects of our business 

throughout 2019 we continued to achieve efficiency gains in various aspects of our business our initial production rates from new wells continued to improve in our four us oil plays and have exceeded the average of the top 40 us producers since 2015 by more than 40 we continued to improve cycle times incorporate production optimization strategies and other cost reduction initiatives driving down breakeven costs across our portfolio of assets 

as we focus on a more streamlined portfolio of us oil assets we are aggressively pursuing an improved cost structure to further expand margins we have realized annualized cost savings by reducing well costs production expense financing costs and ga costs 

 

index to financial statements 

financial strength and flexibility – commodity prices are uncertain and volatile so we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet as well as adequate liquidity and financial flexibility in order to operate competitively in all commodity price cycles our capital allocation decisions are made with attention to these financial stewardship principles  as well as the priorities of funding our core operations protecting our investmentgrade credit ratings and paying and growing our shareholder dividend 

during 2019 we reduced our consolidated debt by 17 billion primarily from proceeds from our divestitures we also raised our quarterly dividend 125 and repurchased 69 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program 

  

oil and gas properties

canadian business and barnett shale assets – discontinued operations

as a result of our divestment of substantially all of our oil and gas assets and operations in canada as well as the recently announced divestiture of our barnett shale assets amounts associated with these assets are presented as discontinued operations therefore financial and operational data such as reserves production wells and acreage provided in this document exclude amounts related to our canadian and barnett shale assets unless otherwise noted included within the amounts presented as discontinued operations associated with the barnett shale are properties divested in previous reporting periods located primarily in johnson and wise counties texas for additional information please see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

property profiles

key summary data from each of our areas of operation as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 are detailed in the map below 

 

index to financial statements 

delaware basin – the delaware basin is devon’s most active program in the portfolio through capitalefficient growth it offer s exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring  wolfcamp and leonard formations with a significant inventory of oil and liquidsrich drilling opportunities that have multizone development potential devon has a robust platform to deliver highmargin growth for many years to come at december 31 201 9  we had eight operated rigs developing this asset in 20 20  we plan to invest approximately  10 b illion of capital in the delaware basin making it the topfunded asset in the portfolio 

stack  – the stack development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties provides longterm optionality through its significant inventory our stack position is one of the largest in the industry providing visible longterm production in december 2019 we announced an agreement with dow to jointly develop a portion of our stack acreage dow will fund approximately 65 of the partnership capital requirements through a drilling carry of 100 million over the next four years in 2020 we plan approximately 75 million of capital investment 

powder river basin – this asset is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin recent drilling success in this basin has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we accelerate activity and continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity as of december 31 2019 we had three operated rigs targeting the turner parkman teapot and niobrara formations in northern converse county wyoming of the powder river basin in 2020 we plan approximately 350 million of capital investment 

eagle ford – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in 2014 since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results driven by our development in dewitt county texas located in the economic core of the play our eagle ford production is leveraged to oil and has lowcost access to premium gulf coast pricing providing for solid operating margins our eagle ford assets generated substantial cash flow in 2019 in 2020 we plan approximately 300 million of capital investment 

proved reserves

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 21 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves in compliance with applicable sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates and are independent of the operating groups the director of the group has over 30 years of industry experience a degree in engineering and is a registered professional engineer the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2019 we engaged laroche petroleum consultants ltd to audit approximately 85 of our proved reserves additionally we have a reserves committee that provides additional oversight of our reserves process the committee consists of five independent members of our board of directors with education or business backgrounds relevant to the reserves estimation process

the following tables present production price and cost information for each significant field 

 



 



 





drilling statistics

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results in the us

 



 



 

index to financial statements 

as of december 31 201 9  the re were 132 gross and 953 net wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling completing or waiting on completion gross wells are the sum of all wells in which we own a working interest net wells are gross wells multiplied by our fractional working interests in each well 

productive wells

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2019



 







the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 3955 gross wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing drilling and construction overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of ga which is a common industry practice

acreage statistics

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2019 of our 18 million net acres approximately 11 million acres are held by production and approximately 20 are located on federal lands the acreage in the table includes approximately 01 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2020 2021 and 2022 as of december 31 2019 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with our expiring acreage of the 01 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2022 we anticipate performing operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2019 we allowed approximately 01 million acres to expire



 





title to properties

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry a preliminary title investigation typically consisting of a review of local title records is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties more thorough title investigations which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside legal counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

marketing activities 

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2020 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 



 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2019 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

customers

during 2019 and 2017 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our consolidated sales revenue

 

during 2018 we had one purchaser that accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated sales revenue

public policy and government regulation 

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations

exploration and production regulation

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include



























our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members the federal government has from time to time evaluated and in some cases promulgated new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands in addition permitting activities on federal lands can sometimes be subject to delays

 

index to financial statements 

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in a socially and environmentally responsible manner which includes compliance with applicable law we are subject to many federal state and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment and natural resources environmental laws and regulations relate to



















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which can allow environmental organizations to sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law environmental organizations also can assert legal and administrative challenges to certain actions of oil and gas regulators such as the blm for allegedly failing to comply with environmental laws which can result in delays in obtaining permits or other necessary authorizations environmental protection and health and safety compliance are necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example over the last five years nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from highs of over 75 per bbl and 480 per mmbtu respectively to lows of under 27 per bbl and 170 per mmbtu respectively such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to











 

index to financial statements 





















estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development and appraisal activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors moreover our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

 

index to financial statements 

our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks 

our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to



















the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property as well as significant liabilities moreover certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant damage to property and natural resources for example we have from time to time experienced wellcontrol events that have resulted in various remediation and cleanup costs and certain of the other impacts described above

in addition we rely on our employees consultants and subcontractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals whether through negligence harassment discrimination or other misconduct could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business for example negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury death or property damage and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business

our operations are subject to extensive federal state local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators including corporate successors of former operators these requirements may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions

in addition changes in public policy have affected and in the future could further affect our operations regulatory and public policy developments could among other things restrict production levels impose price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and 

 

index to financial statements 

other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations in addition changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by among other things increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty for example changes in us trade relations particularly the imposition of tariffs by the us and china may increase the cost of materials we or our vendors use thereby increasing our operating expense although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing environmental matters more generally seismic activity and income taxes as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing – in recent years various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process for example the epa has issued regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and it finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a report in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017 moreover several states in which we operate have adopted or stated intentions to adopt laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing imposing more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing in addition to state laws local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular 

beyond these regulatory efforts various policy makers regulatory agencies and political candidates at the federal state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing including prohibiting the technology outright for example certain candidates running to be elected president of the united states in 2020 have pledged to impose a ban on hydraulic fracturing it is possible that any such restrictions may particularly target industry activity on federal lands which could adversely impact our operations in the delaware and powder river basins as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases as of december 31 2019 approximately 20 of our total leasehold resides on federal lands and approximately 40 and 60 of our leasehold in the delaware and powder river basins respectively resides on federal lands although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations

environmental laws generally – in addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing we are subject to various other federal state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

seismic activity – earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow

concerns about climate change and related regulatory social and market actions may adversely affect our business 

continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative regulatory and other initiatives including international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane policy makers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases for example both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry following the change in presidential administrations however the agencies have attempted to revise or rescind their previously issued methane standards litigation concerning these methane regulations and subsequent attempts to revise or rescind them is ongoing nevertheless several states where we operate including wyoming and new mexico have already imposed or stated intentions to impose laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities with respect to more comprehensive regulation policy makers and political candidates have made or expressed support for a variety of proposals such as the development of capandtrade or carbon tax programs as well as the more sweeping “green new deal” resolutions introduced in congress in early 2019 as generally proposed a capandtrade program would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances while a carbon tax could impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and downstream uses of our products the “green new deal” resolutions call for a 10year national mobilization effort to among other things transition 100 of power demand in the us to zeroemission sources and overhaul transportation systems in the us to remove greenhouse gas emissions as much as is technologically feasible 

in addition to regulatory risk other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business for example in an effort to promote a lowercarbon economy there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbonbased fuels such as oil and gas moreover certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations finally governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought and may continue to bring claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change these and the other regulatory social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have an adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts moreover as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation and regulation hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements 

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective share of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities including contingent liabilities owed to and assumed from us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities which could adversely impact our financial results and condition

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us 

as of december 31 2019 we had total indebtedness of 43 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned asset sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding the use of technology in our operations including through artificial intelligence process automation and data analytics concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyber attack related activities which have frequently targeted our industry cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information intellectual property or financial assets corrupting data or causing operational disruptions as well as to prevent users from accessing systems or information and demand payment in order to regain access these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders techniques used in these attacks often range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be performed in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks in addition our vendors midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which in turn could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences including litigation risks moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities 

we have limited control over properties operated by others

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

insurance does not cover all risks

as discussed above our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development and production of oil gas and ngls to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks including pollution events that are considered gradual war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic longterm positions and relationships including with respect to midstream takeaway capacity as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations

our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change

stockholder activism has been increasing in our industry and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by stockholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business such perceived uncertainty may in turn make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to





 

index to financial statements 



in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

devon’s rightofuse operating lease assets are for certain leases related to real estate drilling rigs and other equipment related to the exploration development and production of oil and gas devon’s rightofuse financing lease assets are related to real estate certain of devon’s lease agreements include variable payments based on usage or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation devon’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants

standardized measure 

the following tables reflect devon’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves 



 

future cash inflows development costs and production costs were computed using the same assumptions for prices and costs that were used to estimate devon’s proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each year for 2019 estimates devon’s future realized prices were assumed to be  5358 per bbl of oil  169 per mcf of gas and  1526 per bbl of ngls of the  21 billion of future development costs as of the end of 2019  08 billion  05 billion and  02 billion are estimated to be spent in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively

future development costs include not only development costs but also future asset retirement costs included as part of the  21 billion of future development costs are  04 billion of future asset retirement costs the future income tax expenses have been computed using statutory tax rates giving effect to allowable tax deductions and tax credits under current laws

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

overview of 2019 results

during 2019 we completed our transformation to a us oil growth company with our exit from canada and pending sale of the barnett shale these transactions accelerate efforts to focus exclusively on our resourcerich us oil portfolio which provides us with a strong foundation to grow returns margin and profitability by operating under a disciplined returnsdriven strategy focused on delivering strong operational results financial strength and value to our shareholders and continuing our commitment to environmental social and governance excellence we completed our transformation to “new devon” and made significant progress toward our cost reduction objectives as evidenced by these 2019 highlights  





















 



 

index to financial statements 

 

trends of our annual earnings operating cash flow ebitdax and capital expenditures are shown below the annual earnings chart presents amounts pertaining to both devon’s continuing and discontinued operations the annual cash flow chart presents amounts pertaining to devon’s continuing operations “core earnings” and “ebitdax” are financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap for a description of these measures including reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures see “nongaap measures” in this item 7  

 

 

our net earnings in recent years have been significantly impacted by divestiture transactions and temporary noncash adjustments to the value of our commodity hedges net earnings in 2017 included a 01 billion gain on asset dispositions from continuing operations and a 02 billion hedge valuation gain both net of taxes net earnings in 2018 included a 22 billion gain on our enlink disposition a 05 billion hedge valuation gain and a 02 billion gain on asset dispositions from continuing operations all net of taxes net earnings in 2019 included a 04 billion hedge valuation loss 02 billion net gains and charges related to our canadian disposition and a 06 billion asset impairment related to our barnett shale disposition all net of taxes excluding these amounts our core earnings have been more stable over recent years but continue to be heavily influenced by commodity prices 

 

 

like earnings our operating cash flow is sensitive to volatile commodity prices ebitdax which excludes financial amounts related to discontinued operations has been increasing over the past three years as a result of our new devon production growth and cost reductions regardless of cash flow fluctuations we remain focused on managing our capital investment to generate free cash flow as operating cash flow has declined we have adjusted our capital development plans accordingly 

 

index to financial statements 

business and industry outlook 

 

devon marked its 48th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 31st year as a public company during 2019 as an established company with a strong leadership team we have experience operating through periods of volatile commodity prices with our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets we are committed to navigating the current environment while safeguarding our longterm financial strength 

market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile in 2019 wti oil prices averaged approximately 5702bbl versus 6479bbl in 2018 despite price support in the first half of 2019 driven by supply tightness and geopolitical tensions 2019 wti oil prices overall were negatively impacted by trade concerns and economic slowdown fears even with strong supply and demand fundamentals looking ahead crude oil has experienced near term downward pressure as a result of softer demand from the growing impact of the coronavirus related crisis positive factors that could reduce these recent negative factors and create more demand for crude oil are the extension of opec cuts through 2020 as well as the international maritime organization 2020 regulations 

henry hub gas prices averaged approximately 263mmbtu in 2019 versus 309mmbtu in 2018 mt belvieu blended index ngl prices averaged approximately 1922bbl in 2019 versus 2831bbl in 2018 natural gas and ngl prices faced strong headwinds in 2019 due to us supply growth far outpacing demand for both commodities domestically and internationally these factors continue to weigh on current natural gas and ngl prices 

as discussed in our critical accounting estimates  our stack assets are susceptible to a material asset impairment should prices decrease from current levels while such an impairment would materially impact our reported net earnings it would not impact our operating cash flow or our current nearterm drilling plans 

to mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and ensure our financial strength we continue to execute a disciplined riskmanagement hedging program our hedging program incorporates both systematic hedges added on a regular basis and discretionary hedges layered in on an opportunistic basis to take advantage of favorable market conditions we are adding 2020 positions at desirable prices and we currently have approximately 40 of our anticipated oil volumes and 25 of our anticipated gas volumes hedged additionally we are actively adding attractive hedges for 2021 further insulating our cash flow we continue to examine and when appropriate execute attractive regional basis swap hedges in an effort to protect price realizations across our portfolio 

throughout 2019 our operational efficiencies continued to accelerate our improved cost structure expanded margins and we ended the year ahead of our multiyear cost savings initiative plan as we carry our 2019 momentum into 2020 we will maintain our capitalefficiency focus and intensify our steadfast commitment to capital discipline our returnsdriven strategy will be underpinned by our continued efforts to improve our cost structure and grow highermargin oil production as such our 2020 capital program has been optimized for strong returns high singledigit oil growth free cash flow and enhanced pershare cash flow growth 

to achieve our 2020 capital program objectives our capital allocation priorities are fourfold maintain base production fund dividends invest in highreturn growth projects and return excess cash to shareholders accordingly over half of the 2020 spend will be focused in on our highest margin us oil play the delaware basin as the most active program in devon’s portfolio capital activity in the delaware basin will be diversified across five core areas also accretive to our 2020 returnsfocused capital program is our 2020 rockies activity where spend will be prioritized to our toptier powder river basin development activity in total our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver us oil growth of approximately 75 to 90 on a retained asset basis

field prices

 



 



 



 

  



 

from 2018 to 2019 field prices contributed to a 686 million decrease in earnings unhedged realized oil gas and ngl prices decreased primarily due to lower wti henry hub and mont belvieu index prices these decreases were partially offset by favorable hedge cash settlements across each of our products

net earnings from discontinued operations net of tax decreased 28 billion as we recognized a  26 billion 22 billion aftertax gain on the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner during 2018 net earnings from discontinued operations also decreased due to a 748 million asset impairment to our barnett shale assets in the fourth quarter of 2019 

2018 vs 2017

net earnings from discontinued operations net of tax increased 15 billion as we recognized a 26 billion 22 billion aftertax gain on the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner during 2018 the gain was partially offset by a decrease in upstream revenues which was primarily driven by widening differentials for bitumen sales in canada to the wti index during the fourth quarter of 2018 market forces widened canadian heavy oil differentials beyond historical norms and negatively impacted the price we realized on our canadian production we had basis swaps for approximately half of our fourth quarter production to mitigate the effect of the lower market price to further mitigate the effects of the lower price we reduced our jackfish production in november 2018 which impacted our fourth quarter production by approximately 8 mbblsd for discussion on discontinued operations see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

capital resources uses and liquidity

 

sources and uses of cash

the following table presents the major changes in cash and cash equivalents for the time periods presented below

 



 

operating cash flow – continuing operations

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2019 our operating cash flow increased 460 million or 29 to 20 billion year over year in 2019 our operating cash flow nearly funded the entirety of our capital expenditures program and dividends allowing us to use available cash balances and net divestiture proceeds to fund other capital uses

our operating cash flow increased 340 million or 27 from 2017 to 2018 our operating cash flow funded approximately 70 of our capital expenditures program and dividends in 2018 and 2017 respectively as a result we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows 

divestitures of property and investments – continuing operations

during 2019 2018 and 2017 as part of our announced divestiture programs we sold noncore us upstream assets for 390 million 500 million and 425 million respectively for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

capital expenditures

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures and property acquisitions

 



 

index to financial statements 

 

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties our capital program is designed to operate within or near operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow this is evidenced by our operating cash flow fully funding capital expenditures in 2019 and funding approximately 75 and 77 of capital expenditures in 2018 and 2017 respectively our capital expenditures are lower in 2019 primarily due to our decreased spending in the stack partially offset by increased capital investment in higher margin assets in the delaware and powder river basins

debt activity net

during 2019 our debt decreased 162 million due to the repayment of our 630 senior notes at maturity 

during 2018 our debt decreased 922 million due to completed tender offers of certain longterm debt as well as the maturity of certain senior notes in conjunction with the tender offers we recognized a 312 million loss on the early retirement of debt including 304 million of cash retirement costs and fees for additional information see note 13 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions

we repurchased 686 million shares of common stock for 18 billion in 2019 and 781 million shares of common stock for 30 billion in 2018 under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors for additional information see note 17 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report 

devon paid common stock dividends of 140 million 149 million and 127 million during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively during the second quarter of 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend 33 from 006 to 008 per share as part of our focus on returning cash to shareholders in february 2019 we further increased our quarterly dividend 125 to 009 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2019 for additional information see note 1 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

contributions from noncontrolling interests

during 2019 we received approximately 116 million in cash contributions from our partner in cdm 

 

index to financial statements 

cash flows from discontinued operations 

all cash flows in the following table relate to activities from discontinued operations for the time periods presented discontinued operations include our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner that devon divested in july 2018 and the canadian business that devon sold in june 2019 discontinued operations also include the barnett shale assets that devon has contracted to sell and which is expected to close during the second quarter of 2020 as well as previously divested barnett shale properties located primarily in johnson and wise counties texas

 



operating cash flow in 2019 decreased 11 billion and 16 billion from 2018 and 2017 respectively as a result of the divestitures referenced above additionally operating cash flow was negatively affected in the first quarter of 2019 primarily due to realization impacts associated with the widening canadian differentials in the fourth quarter of 2018 foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity resulted in a realized loss of 32 million and 241 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity resulted in a realized gain of 9 million in 2017 as a result of the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar there was an offset in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash line in the above table resulting in no impact to the net change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

 

on june 27 2019 devon completed the sale of substantially all its oil and gas assets and operations in canada for proceeds of 26 billion in the second and fourth quarter of 2018 devon completed the sale of a portion of its barnett shale assets located primarily in johnson and wise counties texas for approximately 500 million in combined proceeds on july 18 2018 devon completed the sale of its aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner for 3125 billion during 2017 enlink divested its ownership interest in howard energy partners for approximately 190 million 

cash flows from financing activities includes the 15 billion of senior notes retired prior to maturity in july 2019 and common and preferred units enlink issued and sold during 2017 generating net proceeds of 501 million distributions to noncontrolling interests in the table above exclude the distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon which have been eliminated in consolidation distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon were 134 million and 265 million during 2018 and 2017 respectively 

liquidity

the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive because oil natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource we like all upstream operators must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production generally our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production 

 

index to financial statements 

from existing wells at opportunistic times we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets 

historically our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances if needed we can also issue debt and equity securities including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section

key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years at the end of 2019 we held approximately 18 billion of cash inclusive of 380 million of cash restricted for discontinued operations our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables differ from our expectations 

commodity prices – the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce and sell prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk we hedge our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2019 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

further when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities should wti drop closer to 45bbl for an extended period we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity however as wtibbl rises above 50 our free cash flow will accelerate providing additional capital allocation opportunities

operating expenses – commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices 

in 2019 we aggressively optimized our cost structure in conjunction with our canadian and barnett shale asset divestitures as we focus on our remaining four us oil plays align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt these optimizations include cost reductions and efficiencies related to our capital programs ga financing costs and production expenses 

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from our joint interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings

divestitures of property and equipment 

in december 2019 we announced the sale of our barnett shale assets for approximately 770 million we expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2020 

credit availability

we have 30 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31 2019 on december 13 2019 we entered into an amendment and extension agreement to among other things i effect the extension of the maturity date of the senior credit facility from october 5 2023 to october 5 2024 with respect to the consenting lenders and ii modify the maximum number of maturity extension requests during the term of the senior credit facility from two to three as a result of this amendment the senior credit facility matures on october 5 2024 with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional oneyear periods subject to lender consent subsequent to october 5 2023 the borrowing capacity decreases to 28 billion the senior credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2019 there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 13 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with this covenant with a 191 debttocapitalization ratio

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness 

debt ratings

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s financial services is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from fitch is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from moody’s investor service is ba1 with a positive outlook any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

share repurchase program

in december 2019 our board of directors approved a 10 billion share repurchase program that expires on december 31 2020 this repurchase program was approved in conjunction with the announced divestiture of devon’s assets in the barnett shale under this new program 800 million of the 10 billion authorization is conditioned upon the closing of the pending barnett shale divestiture

capital expenditures 

our 2020 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately 17 billion to 185 billion

in december 2019 we announced a partnership under which we will monetize half our working interest across 133 undrilled locations in the stack for an approximate 100 million drilling carry spread over the next four years drilling operations under this agreement are expected to commence in mid2020

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

oil and gas assets accounting classification reserves  valuation

successful efforts method of accounting and classification 

we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize then subject to dda calculations and impairment assessments and valuations

 

once a well is drilled the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience development wells are always capitalized costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed when making this determination management considers current activities nearterm plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized at december 31 2019 all suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year

 

similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs costs for undeveloped leasehold for which reserves have not been proven must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment at the end of each quarter management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans drilling activity results commodity price outlooks planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects at december 31 2019 devon had approximately 250 million of undeveloped leasehold of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31 2019 approximately 6 million is scheduled to expire in 2020 the leasehold expiring in 2020 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling if our drilling is not successful this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired 

 

reserves

our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dda calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a thirdparty petroleum consulting firm in 2019 85 of our reserves were subjected to such audits

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived assets used in operations including proved and unproved oil and gas properties are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group for dda calculations and impairment assessments management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level “common operating field” for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition which requires judgment management also considers the nature of production common infrastructure common sales points common processing plants common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations these determinations impact the amount of dda recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment

management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes commodity prices operating costs and capital investment plans considering all available information at the date of review the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and riskadjusted proved undeveloped probable and possible reserves besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pretax cash flows for our impairment determinations we utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years we estimate and escalate or deescalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history changes to any of these assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pretax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of impairments should management materially reduce planned capital investment and commodity prices remain depressed recognition of material asset impairments could become more likely for certain of our assets

as commodity prices decreased throughout 2019 and at yearend approximated the prices devon used to determine and compute material asset impairments in 2019 management conducted a robust review of its assets for impairment as of december 31 2019 based on our recent impairment evaluations our stack asset’s sum of undiscounted pretax cash flows exceeds the carrying value by less than 10 this cushion has narrowed significantly since the end of 2018 due primarily to approximately 30 and 5 declines in forward ngl and natural gas pricing respectively and negative nonprice reserve revisions of approximately 40 mmboe as discussed in note 21 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report as of december 31 2019 the difference between the stack’s undiscounted pretax cash flows which is used to determine whether an impairment exists and the discounted pretax cash flows which is used to measure an impairment is approximately 20 billion therefore if commodity prices deteriorate or we materially reduce future development plans causing the capitalized costs to exceed the undiscounted pretax cash flows our stack asset would be subject to a material impairment of capitalized costs 

income taxes

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized within continuing operations devon maintains only a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets including certain tax credits and state net operating losses devon also has recorded a valuation allowance in discontinued operations against certain canadian deferred tax assets 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

core earnings

 

we make reference to “core earnings loss attributable to devon” and “core earnings loss per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2019 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap core earnings loss attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results for more information on the results of discontinued operations for our barnett shale assets canadian operations and for enlink and the general partner see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure amounts excluded for 2019 relate to asset dispositions the gain on the sale of canadian operations noncash asset impairments including noncash barnett shale and unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance costs associated with early retirement of debt fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2019 and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the divestment of our canadian operations in 2019 

 

amounts excluded for 2018 relate to asset dispositions the gain on the sale of devon’s aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance costs associated with early retirement of debt fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency  restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2018 

 

amounts excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments us tax reform changes deferred tax asset valuation allowance derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early retirement of debt

 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin 

to assess the performance of our assets we use ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense financing costs net exploration expenses dda asset impairments asset disposition gains and losses noncash sharebased compensation noncash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items not related to our normal operations fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses production expenses consist of lease operating gathering processing and transportation expenses as well as production and property taxes

we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period dda and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred we exclude sharebased compensation valuation changes restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance 

we believe ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations 

below are reconciliations of net earnings to ebitdax and a further reconciliation to fieldlevel cash margin

 item 7a quantitative and qual itative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our gas and ngl production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2019 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2019 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by approximately 115 million

 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2019 we had total debt of 43 billion all of our debt is based on fixed interest rates averaging 60

foreign currency risk

devon has certain canadian dollar obligations associated with its divested canadian operations which are to be paid with the cash restricted for discontinued operations these balances are remeasured using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2019 balance sheet for these items see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for additional information

our strategy

our business strategy is focused on delivering a consistently competitive shareholder return among our peer group because the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive delivering sustainable capital efficient cash flow growth is a key tenant to our success while our cash flow is highly dependent on volatile and uncertain commodity prices we pursue our strategy throughout all commodity price cycles with three fundamental principles

a premier sustainable portfolio of assets – as discussed in the next section of this annual report we own a portfolio of assets located in the united states and alberta canada we strive to own premier assets capable of generating cash flows in excess of our capital and operating requirements as well as competitive rates of return we also desire to own a portfolio of assets that can provide a production growth platform extending many years into the future because of the strength of oil prices relative to natural gas we have been positioning our portfolio to be more heavily weighted to us oil assets in recent years 

during 2018 we made significant progress in our transition to a us oil company we sold our midstream business and certain noncore upstream assets generating nearly 5 billion in proceeds in february 2019 we announced our intent to separate our canadian business and our barnett shale assets from the company after these separations we expect our oil production growth price realizations and fieldlevel margins will all improve as we sharpen our focus on four core us oil plays located in the delaware basin stack eagle ford and rockies

superior execution – as we pursue cash flow growth we continually work to optimize the efficiency of our capital programs and production operations with an underlying objective of reducing absolute and per unit costs and enhancing our returns we also strive to leverage our culture of health safety and environmental stewardship in all aspects of our business 

throughout 2018 we continued to achieve efficiency gains in various aspects of our business our initial production rates from new wells continued to improve in our four core us oil plays and have exceeded the average of the top 40 us producers since 2015 by more than 40 we continued to improve cycle times incorporate production optimization strategies and other cost reduction initiatives driving down breakeven costs across our portfolio of assets 

as we focus on a more streamlined portfolio of us oil assets we are aggressively pursuing an improved cost structure with 780 million of annual costs savings expected by 2021 we expect to realize about 70 of the annualized savings by the end of 2019 our retained us oil business is expected to realize 300 million of annual well cost savings by 2021 as we increase our focus on development drilling reduce our facility costs and optimize well spacing in the stack additionally we will streamline and align our workforce with our goforward business which should result in 300 million of annual cost savings by the end of the threeyear period as we continue deleveraging we expect to reduce annual interest costs by 130 million finally we have plans to reduce our annual production expenses by 50 million over the next three years

financial strength and flexibility – commodity prices are uncertain and volatile so we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet as well as adequate liquidity and financial flexibility in order to operate competitively in all commodity price cycles our capital allocation decisions are made with attention to these financial stewardship principles as well as the priorities of funding our core operations protecting our investmentgrade credit ratings and paying and growing our shareholder dividend 

 

index to financial statements 

during 2018 we reduced our consolidated debt by 40 primarily from our divestitures we also raised our quarterly dividend 33 and began a 4 billion share repurchase program  as we dispose of our canadian and barnett shale assets in 2019 we expect to use the proceeds to reduce debt further and repurchase add itional common shares  as a result of our planned dispositions our board of directors has increased our share repurchase program to 5 billion in february 2019 and raised our quarterly dividend 125 to 009 per share  

oil and gas properties

property profiles

key summary data from each of our areas of operation as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 are detailed in the map below notes 22 and 23 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

index to financial statements 

delaware basin – the delaware basin is one of devon’s top assets and continues to offer exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring wolfcamp and leonard formations we expect these oil and liquidsrich opportunities across our acreage in the delaware basin to deliver highmargin growth for many years to come during 2018 our continued appraisal and development work enabled us to increase our proved reserves in this area by approximately 24 at december 31 2018 we had 10 operated rigs developing this asset in 2019 we plan to invest approximately 900 million of capital in the delaware basin making it the topfunded asset in the portfolio 

stack  – the stack development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties is one of devon’s top assets our stack position is one of the largest in the industry providing visible longterm stable production at december 31 2018 we had five operated rigs with drilling focused in the meramec formation in 2019 we plan approximately 400 million of capital investment the stack is devon’s second highest funded asset in the portfolio for 2019 

eagle ford – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in 2014 since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results by producing 173 million oilequivalent barrels our excellent results are driven by our development in dewitt county located in the economic core of the play our eagle ford assets generated significant cash flow in 2018 in 2019 we plan approximately 300 million of capital investment 

rockies oil – our acreage in the rockies is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin recent drilling success in this basin has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we accelerate activity and continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity as of december 31 2018 we had two operated rigs targeting the turner parkman teapot and niobrara formations in northern converse county of the powder river basin in 2019 we plan approximately 300 million of capital investment and adding two additional operated rigs 

heavy oil – our operations in canada are focused on our heavy oil assets in alberta canada our most significant canadian operation is our jackfish complex an industryleading thermal heavy oil operation in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we employ a recovery method known as steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the jackfish operation consists of three facilities we expect jackfish to maintain a reasonably flat production profile for greater than 15 years requiring approximately 200 million of annual maintenance capital based on current economic conditions 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2018 currently we have minimal planned capital outlays for pike in the near future the majority of our pike leasehold does not expire until 2025 and 2026

in addition to jackfish and pike we hold acreage and own producing assets in the bonnyville region located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta bonnyville is a lowrisk oil development play that produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection

in 2019 we plan to separate our operations in canada

barnett shale – this is our largest property in terms of proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to optimize production operations and have transformed this asset into one of the top producing gas fields in north america in 2019 we plan to separate our barnett shale assets 

proved reserves

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 23 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time

 

index to financial statements 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates the group reports to and is managed through our finance department no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked

the director of the group has over 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility for the estimation and evaluation of reserves he has been employed by devon for the past 18 years including the past 11 in his current position his further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering registered professional engineer member of the society of petroleum engineers and experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america 

throughout the year the group performs internal reserves reviews of each operating country’s reserves the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2018 we engaged two such firms to audit approximately 89 of our proved reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited approximately 87 of our us reserves and deloitte llp audited approximately 97 of our canadian reserves

in addition to conducting these internal reviews and external reserves audits we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the members of our reserves committee have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with our thirdparty petroleum consultants

title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry a preliminary title investigation typically consisting of a review of local title records is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties more thorough title investigations which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside legal counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

marketing activities

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information

as of january 2019 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 



 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2018 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

customers

during 2018 we had one purchaser that accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated sales revenue

during 2017 and 2016 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our consolidated sales revenue

public policy and government regulation 

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations

exploration and production regulation

our operations are subject to federal tribal state provincial and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include



























our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members the federal government has from time to time evaluated and in some cases promulgated new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands in addition permitting activities on federal lands can sometimes be subject to delays

royalties and incentives in canada

the royalty calculation in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of canadian oil and gas production oil sands crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production net of allowed deductions the royalty percentage is determined on a slidingscale based on crown posted prices for prepayout oil sands projects the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered in 

 

index to financial statements 

early 2016 the alberta government adopted the recommendation of its royalty review panel the new royalty framework preserves the existing royalty structure and rates for oil sands for conventional oil and gas royalty calculations  wells drilled after january 1 2017 would use the modernized royalty framework mrf which prescribes a lower royalty rate until allowable costs have been recovered the calculation for wells post payout is based on a percentage of production net of allowed deductions and varies with commodity price 

marketing in canada

any oil or gas export requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board 

in december 2018 alberta enacted the curtailment rules rules in an effort to reduce alberta’s oversupply of oil which resulted from pipeline and rail constraints pursuant to the rules operators that produce either or both crude oil or crude bitumen in amounts in excess of 10 mbblsd are required to curtail their production as of january 1 2019 the production curtailment amount was set at 325 mbblsd the curtailment amounts are expected to reduce over 2019 to an average of approximately 95 mbblsd as storage levels ease and price differential improve and the rules terminate on december 31 2019 devon’s curtailments in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of the rules are anticipated to total approximately 10 mbblsd of bitumen or approximately 2 of our total production

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations

we strive to conduct our operations in a socially and environmentally responsible manner which includes compliance with applicable law we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment and natural resources environmental laws and regulations relate to



















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law environmental protection and health and safety compliance are necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon

 

index to financial statements 

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business 

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example over the last five years nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from a high of over 100 per bbl and 6 per mmbtu respectively to a low of under 27 per bbl and 170 per mmbtu respectively such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to





























the differential between wti and western canadian select a benchmark for the canadian oil market recently expanded widening to nearly 46 per barrel in november 2018 as a result our canadian heavy oil unhedged realized price for the fourth quarter was near zero this negatively affected our results of operations in 2018 and a sustained weakness or further deterioration in differentials or commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in or exacerbating the following effects











estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development and appraisal activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report

 

index to financial statements 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

our operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks

our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to



















the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property as well as significant liabilities moreover certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant damage to property and natural resources

in addition we rely on our employees consultants and subcontractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals whether through negligence harassment discrimination or other misconduct could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business for example negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury death or property damage and sexual harassment or racial and gender discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business

our operations are subject to extensive federal state provincial tribal local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such 

 

index to financial statements 

regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations 

in addition changes in public policy have affected and in the future could further affect our operations regulatory and public policy developments could among other things restrict production levels impose price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations in addition changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by among other things increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty for example changes in us trade relations particularly the imposition of tariffs by the us and china may increase the cost of materials we or our vendors use thereby increasing our operating expense although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing pipeline safety seismic activity and income taxes as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing – in recent years the epa has made proposals that subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and that could potentially restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing for example the epa has issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a study in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources although the report did not identify a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and impacts to groundwater resources the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017 several states in which we operate have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws or regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so or banning the practice altogether although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays in development or restrictions on our operations 

pipeline safety – the pipeline assets in which we own interests are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management the phmsa has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas ngl and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids such as oil that in the event of a failure could affect “high consequence areas” additional action by phmsa with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future for example in 2016 phmsa proposed new rules for gas pipelines that extend pipeline safety programs beyond high consequence areas to newly proposed “moderate consequence areas” and would also impose more rigorous testing and reporting requirements on such pipelines to date no further action has been taken phmsa has announced its intent to address the 2016 proposed rules for gas pipelines through three separate final rulemakings in 2019 more recently in january 2017 phmsa finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain phmsa integrity management requirements ie periodic assessments leak detection and repairs regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area the final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines including all hazardous liquid gathering lines following the change in presidential administrations implementation of this rule was delayed but the final rule is expected to be published in the federal register and become effective during the first half of 2019 at this time we cannot predict the cost of such requirements but they could be significant moreover violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties 

seismic activity – earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

 

index to financial statements 

changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow 

concerns about climate change and related regulatory social and market actions may adversely affect our business

continuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative regulatory and other initiatives including international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane policy makers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases for example both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry following the change in presidential administrations however the agencies have attempted to revise or rescind their previously issued methane standards litigation concerning these methane regulations and subsequent attempts to revise or rescind them is ongoing nevertheless several states where we operate including wyoming have already imposed venting and flaring limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities with respect to more comprehensive regulation federal and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of capandtrade or carbon tax programs as generally proposed a capandtrade program would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances while a carbon tax could impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and downstream uses of our products 

in canada greenhouse gas emissions are also being addressed at both the federal and provincial level devon will continue to be subject to alberta’s climate change laws and regulations until at least 2021 those laws and regulations include a legislated oil sands emission limit with forthcoming regulations involving methane emissions reduction targets beginning january 2019 the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act subjects all of canada to a federal price on greenhouse gas emissions unless a province or territory has implemented a compliant carbon pricing regime litigation concerning the act is ongoing and it is unclear how the act will ultimately treat provincial plans in alberta large industrial emitters are subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir the ccir prices carbon but provides cost protection to emissionintensive  tradeexposed industries including devon’s oil sands operations the impact to our operations from these laws and regulations is expected to be minimal in the near term oil and gas facilities that are not subject to the ccir are exempt from its economywide carbon levy until 2023

in addition to regulatory risk other market and social initiatives resulting from the changing perception of climate change present risks for our business for example in an effort to promote a lowercarbon economy there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing the development of alternative energy sources including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies these initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbonbased fuels such as oil and gas moreover certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital have begun restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change such restrictions in capital could make it more difficult to secure funding to operate our business finally governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought and may continue to bring claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change these and the other regulatory social and market risks relating to climate change described above could result in unexpected costs increase our operating expense and reduce the demand for our products which in turn could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts moreover as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost 

 

index to financial statements 

and availability of our hedging arrangements including by causing our contract counterparties which are generally financial institutions and other market participants to curtail or cease their derivatives activities 

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective share of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties may experience insolvency liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities including contingent liabilities owed to and assumed from us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default by these counterparties may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities which could adversely impact our financial results and condition

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us

as of december 31 2018 we had total indebtedness of 59 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned asset sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

environmental matters and related costs can be significant

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding our use of technology in our operations including through process automation and data analytics concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyberattack activities which have been increasing against our industry cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information intellectual property or financial assets 

 

index to financial statements 

corrupting data or causing operational disruptions these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders techniques used in these attacks range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks in addition our vendors midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which in turn could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences including litigation risks moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities 

limited control on properties operated by others

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets all or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally the midstream operators may be subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

insurance does not cover all risks

as discussed above our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development and production of oil gas and ngls to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks including pollution events that are considered gradual war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic longterm positions and relationships including with respect to midstream takeaway capacity as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations

 

index to financial statements 

our business could be adversely impacted by investors attempting to effect change 

stockholder activism has been increasing in our industry and investors may from time to time attempt to effect changes to our business or governance whether by stockholder proposals public campaigns proxy solicitations or otherwise such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our board of directors and employees from core business operations requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs interfering with our ability to successfully execute on strategic transactions and plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business such perceived uncertainty may in turn make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to







in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

overview of 2018 results

2018 was a pivotal year for devon as we took several significant steps toward achieving our longterm strategic goals operationally we successfully transitioned our us oil business into fullfield development which resulted in highreturn lightoil production advancing 14 percent in 2018 in addition to this strong operating performance we made substantial progress highgrading our asset portfolio building pershare value through our sharerepurchase program and reducing our financial leverage by more than 40 percent

business and industry outlook

 

market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile therefore we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell in 2018 wti oil prices averaged approximately 67bbl through october supported by strongerthanexpected oil demand market management by both opec and nonopec partners and unplanned supply outages however oil prices markedly declined in november and december averaging approximately 53bbl and reaching as low as 4253bbl in december the deterioration of wti was driven by opec and nonopec partners unwinding their production cut agreement compounded by rising supply and concerns over slowing global economic growth western canadian select basis differentials were challenged in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to robust production outpacing local demand pipeline capacity and rail capacity out of the region looking ahead current market fundamentals indicate that 2019 crude pricing is expected to improve from its fourth quarter 2018 levels additionally western canadian select differentials are also projected to improve driven by provincially mandated production cuts combined with takeaway capacity additions expected in late 2019 changes in opec production strategies the macroeconomic environment geopolitical risks and other factors could impact our current forecasts

in 2018 devon marked its 30 th year as a public company and 47 th anniversary in the oil and gas business so we are experienced in dealing with the volatile nature of commodity prices to mitigate our exposure to commodity market volatility and ensure our financial strength we use a disciplined riskmanagement hedging program our hedging program incorporates both systematic hedges added on a regular basis and discretionary hedges layered in on an opportunistic basis to take advantage of favorable market conditions we have approximately 50 of our anticipated 2019 oil and gas volumes hedged and we are currently adding hedges for 2020 as well further insulating our cash flow we are proactively locking in hedges on the western canadian select basis differential to wti and currently have approximately 50 of our 2019 canadian heavy oil production hedged 

 

index to financial statements 

despite the uncertainties pertaining to commodity prices we remain focused on our strategic priorities of having a premier portfolio of assets delivering superior execution as we drill and operate oil and natural gas wells and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility 2019 will be an important year fo r devon as we pla n to sepa rate our canadian and barnett shale assets and complete our multiyear transition to a us oil company with operations focused on four core areas in the delaware basin stack eagle ford and rockies with a focused portfolio of us oil assets we also intend to optimize our cost structure by reducing our annual capital costs ga costs interest expense and production expenses by 780 million in the aggregate by 2021 we expect to deliver 70  of these annualized cost savings in 2019 as the canadian and b arnett shale assets are sepa rated  and we align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt  

importantly the portfolio changes and optimized cost performance are expected to enhance our competitive positioning as oil production growth price realizations fieldlevel margins and corporate ratesofreturn should all improve with these improved expected outcomes we remained focused on our 2019 capital allocation priorities of funding our core operations protecting our investmentgrade credit ratings and paying our shareholder dividend further when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position we can achieve all our capital allocation priorities at 46bbl wti and 300mcf henry hub should wti drop closer to 40bbl for an extended period we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity however as wti rises above 46bbl our free cash flow will accelerate providing additional capital allocation opportunities

 

results of operations – 2018 vs 2017

 

the following graphs discussion and analysis are intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations and current financial condition specifically the graph below shows the change in net earnings from 2017 to 2018 the material changes are further discussed by category on the following pages to facilitate the review these numbers are being presented before consideration of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

 



 

index to financial statements 

the graph below presents the drivers of the upstream operations change presented above with additional details and discussion of the drivers following the graph 

 



 

index to financial statements 

 

 

 



 

oil gas and ngl production

 



 



 



 



 

focused development activities in the delaware basin stack and rockies resulted in an approximate 28 increase in production from those areas compared to 2017 these increases also drove a 17 increase in our us retained oil production this strong performance led to the overall growth in our retained assets during 2018 production increases from our capital focused assets were partially offset by the effects of facility repairs and other maintenance work at the jackfish facilities as well as by lower production resulting from our us noncore divestitures 

 

oil gas and ngl prices

 



 



 



 



 

 

 

 

index to financial statements 

 

 

 



 

upstream revenues increased as a result of higher unhedged realized prices for our us oil and ngls 

the increase in oil sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices which were 27 higher in 2018 resulting in an increase of approximately 568 million 

ngl sales increased 351 million as a result of 14 higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub as well as improved realizations in our ngl price

these increases were partially offset by widening differentials to the wti index for bitumen sales which negatively impacted our upstream revenues by 406 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 market forces widened canadian heavy oil differentials beyond historical norms and negatively impacted the price we realized on our canadian production we had basis swaps for approximately half of our fourth quarter production to mitigate the effect of the lower market price to further mitigate the effects of the lower price we reduced our jackfish production in november 2018 which impacted our fourth quarter production by approximately 8 mbblsd our canadian heavy oil unhedged realized price for the fourth quarter was near zero to date in 2019 heavy oil differentials have significantly improved driven by provincially mandated production cuts combined with takeaway capacity additions expected in 2019

 

as further discussed in note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report in 2018 the presentation of certain processing arrangements changed from a net to a gross presentation the change resulted in an increase to our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately 254 million with no impact to net earnings

commodity derivatives

 



 

cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to the instruments described in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationship between contract prices and the associated forward curves 

 

 

 

production expenses

 



 

loe increased 68 million primarily due to continued focus on growing our liquidsrich assets within the stack and delaware basin and higher maintenance costs at our jackfish facilities partially offset by our us noncore divestitures 

as further discussed in note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report in 2018 the presentation of certain processing arrangements changed from a net to a gross presentation the change resulted in an increase to our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately 254 million with no impact to net earnings  

production taxes increased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the increase in our us upstream revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed additionally the increase in oklahoma severance tax rates that became effective during the third quarter of 2018 also contributed to the increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of oil gas and ngl sales 

property taxes increased as a result of higher property value assessments primarily on our texas properties partially offset by our us noncore divestitures

 



 



 

 

index to financial statements 

the overall increase in marketing operating margin was primarily due to improved commodity prices which were partially offset by the impact of our downstream marketing commitments 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

unproved impairments in both periods primarily relate to a portion of acreage in our us noncore operations upon which we do not intend to pursue further exploration and development geological and geophysical costs decreased primarily in the stack and delaware basin 

 



 



 

our oil and gas dda increased primarily due to continued development in the stack delaware basin and rockies properties the increases were slightly offset by reduced production volumes at the jackfish facilities and from our 2018 us noncore asset divestitures

 



 



labor and benefits decreased primarily as a result of the workforce reduction that occurred during 2018 as discussed in note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report nonlabor costs were higher due to an increase in costs related to automation and process improvements 

 



 

financing costs net increased 277 million as a result of a 312 million loss on early retirement of debt for further discussion of early retirement premiums and reduced interest expense resulting from our lower debt balances see note 15 in 

“item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 



 



 

additional information regarding the impairments is discussed in note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

we recognized gains in conjunction with certain of our us asset dispositions in 2017 and 2018 for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

during 2018 we recognized restructuring and transaction costs of 114 million primarily as a result of our workforce reduction see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

the remaining change in other expense was driven primarily by changes on foreign currency exchange instruments as further discussed in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 



 



 

for discussion on income taxes see note 8 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 



discontinued operations net earnings increased primarily due to the gain on the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner of 26 billion 22 billion aftertax for discussion on discontinued operations see note 19 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report” of this report

index to financial statements 

  



oil gas and ngl production

 



 



 



 



production declines reduced our upstream revenues by 427 million primarily as a result of our us divested assets retained production volumes decreased due to reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale these decreases were partially offset by expanded drilling and performance in the stack 

oil gas and ngl prices

 



 



 

 



 

  



 

index to financial statements 

  

upstream revenues increased 14 billion as a result of higher unhedged realized prices across our entire portfolio the increase in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices which were 18 higher in 2017 additionally our oil and bitumen sales benefited from tighter differentials to the wti index the increase in gas sales was driven by higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

commodity derivatives 

 



 

production expenses

 



 

loe decreased 100 million primarily due to our us property divestitures in 2016 well optimization and cost reduction initiatives across our portfolio offset industry inflation these initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal power and fuel compression and workovers 

gathering and transportation expense increased 92 million primarily due to a full year of the access pipeline transportation tolls which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our interest in the pipeline our access transportation agreement contains a base transportation commitment which for the initial five years averages 110 million annually 

production taxes increased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the increase in our us upstream revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

 

property taxes decreased as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas and as a result of our us asset divestitures 

 

 



 



 

unproved impairments primarily relate to a portion of acreage in our us noncore operations upon which we do not intend to pursue further exploration and development geological and geophysical costs increased primarily in the stack and delaware basin

 



 



our oil and gas dda remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year increases in oil and gas dda rates due to continued development in the stack and delaware basin were offset by reduced production volumes resulting from the 2016 us asset divestitures dda from our other property and equipment decreased due to the divestiture of the access pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2016

 



 

financing costs net decreased 400 million primarily as a result of our 21 billion early debt retirement in 2016 for further discussion of early retirement premiums and reduced interest expense resulting from our lower debt balances see note 15 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 



 



in 2016 we recognized proved asset impairments on a portion of our us assets see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for additional information

 

index to financial statements 

we recognized gains in conjunction with certain of our asset dispositions in both 2016 and 2017 and the divestiture of our 50 interest in the access pipeline in 2016 for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

during 2016 we recognized restructuring and transaction costs of 261 million primarily as a result of our workforce reduction for discussion of our reorganization programs and the associated restructuring costs see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

the remaining change in other expense was driven primarily by changes on foreign currency exchange instruments as further discussed in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

capital resources uses and liquidity

 

sources and uses of cash

the following table presents the major changes in cash and cash equivalents for the time periods presented below

 



 

operating cash flow – continuing operations

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2018 our operating cash flow was relatively flat compared to 2017 in 2018 our operating cash flow funded approximately 86 of our capital expenditure program and dividends we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows operating cash flow for 2018 included a realized foreign exchange loss of 241 million relating to foreign currency denominated intercompany loan activity as described in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report there was an offset in the effect of exchange rate and other line in the above table resulting in no impact to the net change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash

our operating cash flow increased 14 billion or 165 from 2016 to 2017 in 2017 our operating cash flow fully funded our capital expenditures program as well as our dividends in 2016 our operating cash flow did not fully fund our capital requirements and dividends as a result we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows 

 

index to financial statements 

divestitures of property and investments 

during 2018 as part of our announced divestiture program we sold noncore us upstream assets for approximately 10 billion for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2017 as part of our announced divestiture program we sold noncore us upstream assets for approximately 420 million for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2016 we divested certain noncore upstream assets in the us and our 50 interest in the access pipeline in canada for approximately 30 billion net of purchase price adjustments proceeds from these divestitures were used primarily for debt repayment and to support capital investment in our core resource plays for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

we did not have significant current cash income taxes resulting from the divestitures in 2018 2017 and 2016

capital expenditures

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures and property acquisitions

 



 

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties our capital program is designed to operate within or near operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow this is evidenced by our operating cash flow funding approximately 91 of capital expenditures in 2018 and fully funding capital expenditures in 2017

acquisition costs in 2016 primarily consisted of devon’s bolton acquisition of assets in the stack play for 15 billion approximately 849 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for more information

debt activity net

during 2018 our debt decreased 922 million due to completed tender offers of certain longterm debt as well as the maturity of certain senior notes in conjunction with the tender offers we recognized a 312 million loss on the early retirement of debt including 304 million of cash retirement costs and fees for additional information see note 15 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2016 our debt decreased 31 billion due to completed tender offers to purchase and redeem 21 billion of debt securities prior to their maturity and a 1 billion reduction in shortterm borrowings in conjunction with the tender offers we recognized a 269 million loss on the early retirement of debt including 265 million of cash retirement costs and fees for additional information see note 15 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions

in june 2018 in conjunction with the announcement of the divestiture of our investment in enlink and the general partner our board of directors authorized a 40 billion share repurchase program of our common stock the share repurchase program expires december 31 2019 as discussed further in note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report we repurchased 781 million shares of common stock for 30 billion or 3811 per share under the asr agreement and through openmarket share repurchases through december 31 2018 

 

index to financial statements 

devon paid common stock dividends of 149 million 127 million and 221 million during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively during the second quarter of 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend 33 to 008 per share as part of our initiative to return cash to shareholders our prior quarterly dividend was 006 per share subsequent to a reduction from 024 per share in the second quarter of 2016 due to the depressed commodity price environment for additional information see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

issuance of common stock

in february 2016 we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters’ option net proceeds from the offering were approximately 15 billion

cash flows from discontinued operations

all cash flows in the following table relate to activities of enlink and the general partner

 



 

operating cash flow in 2018 decreased 224 million and 190 million from 2017 and 2016 respectively as a result of the divestiture of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner in july 2018 

cash flows from investing activities for 2018 includes 3125 billion received from the divestiture of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner partially offset by capital expenditures and other items capital expenditures for enlink’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines during 2017 enlink divested its ownership interest in howard energy partners for approximately 190 million during 2016 enlink acquired anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets for 15 billion approximately 792 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration and debt 

cash flows from financing activities includes common and preferred units enlink issued and sold during 2017 and 2016 generating net proceeds of approximately 501 million and 892 million respectively distributions to noncontrolling interests in the table above exclude the distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon which have been eliminated in consolidation distributions enlink and the general partner paid to devon were 134 million 265 million and 265 million during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

liquidity

the business of exploring for developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive because oil natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource we like all upstream operators must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production generally our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells at opportunistic times we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets 

 

index to financial statements 

historically our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances if needed we can also issue debt and equity securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec in february 2019 we also announced plans to separate our canadian and barnett shale assets and operations we expect to complete these asset separations in 2019 we plan to use the proceeds from these transactions for debt repayments and common share repurchases we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements as discussed in this section 

operating cash flow

key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years at the end of 2018 we held approximately 24 billion of cash our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as these variables differ from our expectations 

commodity prices – the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil bitumen gas and ngls we produce and sell prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control for illustration our operating cash flow slightly increased in 2018 largely due to 16 growth from our retained us liquids portfolio as well as 32 higher realized pricing related to these assets these increases were mostly offset by a significant decrease in our realized price for our bitumen production in 2018 western canadian select basis differentials widened significantly above historical norms due to robust production outpacing local demand pipeline capacity and rail capacity out of the region the market fundamentals led our fourth quarter unhedged realized price for bitumen to be near 0 per bbl in the first two months of 2019 governmentmandated production curtailments and current market fundamentals have led to a significant improvement in the western canadian select basis differential 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk we target hedging approximately 50 of our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions we currently have approximately 50 of our anticipated 2019 oil and gas volumes hedged and we are adding hedges for 2020 as well further insulating our cash flow we are proactively locking in hedges on the western canada select basis differential to wti and currently have approximately 50 of our 2019 canadian heavy oil production hedged the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2018 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

further when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities at 46bbl wti and 300mcf henry hub should wti drop closer to 40bbl for an extended period we would shift our focus to preserving our financial strength and operational continuity however as wtibbl rises above 46 our free cash flow will accelerate providing additional capital allocation opportunities

operating expenses – commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices 

for 2019 we expect to aggressively optimize our cost structure in conjunction with our planned canadian and barnett shale asset divestitures as we focus on our remaining four us oil plays align our workforce with the retained business and reduce outstanding debt we anticipate the planned 780 million reduction of annualized costs will occur over three years with roughly 70 of the savings delivered by the end of 2019 approximately 40 of the reduced costs relate to our capital programs and the remainder relates to our operating expenses including ga interest expense and production expenses

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

 

index to financial statements 

divestitures of property and equipment 

in the first quarter of 2019 we sold noncore assets for approximately 300 million we also anticipate separating our canadian and barnett shale businesses from our company in 2019 

credit availability

our 2018 senior credit facility under which we have 29 billion of available borrowing capacity at december 31 2018 matures on october 5 2023 with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional oneyear periods subject to lender consent the 2018 senior credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2018 there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 15 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion

the 2018 senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 as of december 31 2018 we were in compliance with this covenant with a 210 debttocapitalization ratio

our access to funds from the 2018 senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness 

in january 2019 we repaid the 162 million of 630 senior notes at maturity with cash on hand

debt ratings

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s financial services is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from fitch is bbb with a stable outlook our credit rating from moody’s investor service is ba1 with a positive outlook any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

share repurchase program

in february 2019 our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by an additional 1 billion the 5 billion share repurchase program expires december 31 2019 through february 15 2019 we have executed 34 billion of the authorized program 

 

index to financial statements 

 

capital expenditures

our 2019 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately 20 billion to 225 billion including capital associated with our canadian and barnett shale upstream assets

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the

we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize then subject to dda calculations and impairment assessments and valuations

 

once a well is drilled the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience development wells are always capitalized costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed when making this determination management considers current activities nearterm plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized at december 31 2018 devon had approximately 200 million of well costs suspended for more than one year which largely pertain to its pike heavy oil project stratigraphic testing has demonstrated reserves can be produced economically at pike however this capital intensive longduration project remains unsanctioned by devon and its 50 partner which is the primary reason reserves have not been designated as proven at pike with no lease expiration at pike in the near future management continues to keep the pike exploratory costs capitalized

 

similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs costs for undeveloped leasehold for which reserves have not been proven must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment at the end of each quarter management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans drilling activity results commodity price outlooks planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects at december 31 2018 devon had 12 billion of undeveloped leasehold and capitalized interest which includes approximately 750 million related to pike consistent with the evaluation above on suspended well costs the costs for pike continue to remain capitalized of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31 2018 approximately 10 million is scheduled to expire in 2019 the leasehold expiring in 2019 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling if our drilling is not successful this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired 

 

reserves

our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dda calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by thirdparty petroleum consulting firms in 2018 89 of our reserves were subjected to such audits

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

valuation of longlived assets

longlived assets used in operations including proved and unproved oil and gas properties are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group for dda calculations and impairment assessments management groups individual 

 

index to financial statements 

assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level “common operating field” for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition which requires judgment management also considers the nature of production common infrastructure common sales points common processing plants common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations these determinations impact the amount of dda recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment 

management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes commodity prices operating costs and capital investment plans considering all available information at the date of review besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pretax cash flows for our impairment determinations we generally utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years we estimate and escalate or deescalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history changes to any of these assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pretax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of impairments due to suppressed commodity prices in 2016 we recognized significant asset impairments with generally higher pricing in 2017 and 2018 we did not recognize material asset impairments 

goodwill

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable as of december 31 2018 the us reporting unit had goodwill totaling 841 million 

we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed as part of our qualitative assessment we considered the general macroeconomic industry and market conditions changes in cost factors actual and expected financial performance significant changes in management strategy or customers and stock performance if the qualitative assessment determines that a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required then the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses including comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 

based on our qualitative assessment as of october 31 2018 it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the us reporting unit is less than its carrying amount since our annual test for goodwill impairment on october 31 2018 was performed our stock price decreased 30 from october 31 to december 31 as such we performed an updated assessment as of december 31 2018 to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on our qualitative assessment as of december 31 2018 it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the us reporting unit is less than its carrying value

our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments as discussed above differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations if actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges which would be recognized in the period in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value we would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future operating results which could result in future goodwill impairments for our us reporting unit due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations 

 

index to financial statements 

the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized 

income taxes

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at the end of 2017 we recorded a 100 valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets upon closing the enlink divestiture in the third quarter of 2018 devon reassessed its position and determined that its us segment is no longer in a full valuation allowance position maintaining only valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets including certain tax credits and state net operating losses devon also has recorded a partial valuation allowance against certain canadian deferred tax assets that were generated by a 2017 canadian legal entity restructuring 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

 

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing us income tax laws changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 

 

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities

 







 

because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impractical to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies

nongaap measures 

core earnings

 

we make reference to “core earnings loss attributable to devon” and “core earnings loss per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2018 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures core earnings loss attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results additionally we’ve presented our discontinued operations associated with the sale of our aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner separately to show our results on a goforward basis for more information on the results of operations for enlink and the general partner see note 19 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report our nongaap measures are typically used as a performance measure amounts excluded for 2018 relate to asset dispositions the gain on the sale of devon’s aggregate ownership interests in enlink and the general partner noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments deferred tax asset valuation allowance costs associated with early retirement of debt fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2018 workforce reduction and settlements relating to minimum volume contract commitments 

 

amounts excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments us tax reform changes deferred tax asset valuation allowance derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early retirement of debt

 

amounts excluded for 2016 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including an impairment of enlink goodwill including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses rig stacking costs deferred tax asset valuation allowance restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 workforce reduction derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and costs associated with early retirement of debt 

 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts which typically make similar adjustments in their estimates of our financial results we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin 

to assess the performance of our assets we use ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense financing costs net exploration expenses depreciation depletion and amortization asset impairments asset disposition gains and losses noncash sharebased compensation noncash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items not related to our normal operations fieldlevel cash margin is computed as oil gas and ngl revenues less production expenses production expenses consist of lease operating gathering processing and transportation expenses as well as production and property taxes 

we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period dda and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred we exclude sharebased compensation valuation changes restructuring and transaction costs accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance 

we believe ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations 

below are reconciliations of net earnings from continuing operations to ebitdax and a further reconciliation to fieldlevel cash margin because we have sold upstream assets in the periods presented and have plans to dispose our canadian and barnett shale businesses which represent approximately 40 of our 2018 production volumes we have also excluded the ebitdax and fieldlevel cash margin for our divested assets canada and the barnett shale to compute adjusted ebitdax and adjusted fieldlevel cash margin we use adjusted ebitdax and adjusted fieldlevel cash margin to assess the performance of our portfolio of upstream assets on a “samestore” basis across periods

 item 7a quantitative and qual itative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil bitumen gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil bitumen gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2018 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2018 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by approximately 270 million

 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2018 we had total debt of 59 billion all of our debt is based on fixed interest rates averaging 54

as of december 31 2018 we had one open interest rate swap position that is presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report the fair value of our interest rate swap is largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the three month libor rate a 10 change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet or liquidity at december 31 2018

foreign currency risk

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2018 balance sheet

devon engages in intercompany loan activity between subsidiaries with different functional currencies the value of these foreign currency denominated intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement into the subsidiaries’ functional currency based on the amount of the intercompany loans as of december 31 2018 a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

devon strategy

devon is committed to delivering consistent topquartile shareholder return among its peer group through a highly engaged culture focused on innovation safety operational excellence environmental stewardship and social responsibility we also maintain a strong commitment to financial strength and flexibility through all commodity price cycles as reflected in the company’s investment grade credit ratings 

devon’s “2020 vision” is our plan through the end of the decade intended to optimize returns and deliver toptier capitalefficient cashflow growth our 2020 vision is focused on the following strategic priorities











our portfolio of exploration and production assets and operations provides stable environmentally responsible production and a platform for future growth in 2017 we continued the development of our worldclass operations in the stack and delaware basin these assets provide us with a sustainable multidecade growth platform that continues to improve with our successful drilling programs during 2017 we delivered the best well productivity in devon’s 46year history and continued a fiveyear streak of increasing devon’s initial 90day production rates with investments in proprietary data tools predictive analytics and artificial intelligence we are delivering industryleading initialrate well productivity and improving the performance of our established wells devon has more than doubled its onshore north american oil production since 2012 and has a deep inventory of development opportunities to deliver future oil growth 

as we enter 2018 and look toward the future we expect to achieve additional efficiencies across our portfolio we expect to fund activity within our cash flow and remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner to maximize value and return 

 

index to financial statements 

we believe we capture the full value of our assets and improve returns through maximizing our base production and optimizing our capital program the activities that support this strategy include minimizing controllable downtime enhancing well productivity ensuring disciplined project execution performing premier technical work focusing on developmental drilling and reducing our operating and capital costs 

we also continue to implement new shareholderfriendly initiatives which include new returnsbased metrics aligned to employee compensation and the conversion to successful efforts accounting which provides greater transparency into our financial performance

enlink strategy

enlink focuses on providing gathering transmission processing storage fractionation and marketing to upstream oil and natural gas producers including devon 

enlink connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems processes natural gas for the removal of ngls fractionates ngls into purity products and markets those products for a fee transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets furthermore enlink purchases natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities industrial consumers other marketers and pipelines

enlink’s primary business objective is to provide stable cash flow while growing through prudent and profitable investments enlink accomplishes its objectives through longterm feebased contracts and maintaining a strong financial position through a conservative and balanced capital structure highlighted by its investment grade status enlink has consistently demonstrated expertise within the mlp space and continues to employ a proven business model that includes growing expanding and executing on its strategy within top basins where devon and other successful upstream producers operate

oil and gas properties 

property profiles

key summary data from each of our areas of operation as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 are detailed in the map below notes 23 and 24 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas

led by results from our franchise assets stack and delaware basin devon achieved the best drilling results in our 46year history our initial 90day production rates in 2017 increased more than 400 from 2012 levels these productivity improvements were driven by activity focused in top resource plays improved subsurface reservoir characterization leadingedge completion designs and improvements in lateral placement the most significant reserves growth came from our us operations where we replaced approximately 150 of our 2017 production with proved reserves additions from the drill bit 

delaware basin – the delaware basin is one of devon’s toptwo franchise assets and continues to offer exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring delaware wolfcamp and leonard formations we expect these oil and liquidsrich opportunities across our acreage in the delaware basin to 

 

index to financial statements 

deliver highmargin growth for many years to come during 2017 our continued appraisal and development work enabled us to increase our proved reserves by approximately 60 at december 31 2017 we had eight operated rigs developing this asset in 2018 we plan to invest approximately 725 million of capital in the delaware basin as we shift to expanded development operations primarily focused on the bone spring formation 

stack  – the stack development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties is one of devon’s toptwo franchise assets devon is currently targeting the woodford shale and the meramec zones our stack position is one of the largest and best in the industry providing visible longterm growth completion design enhancements have resulted in greater productivity and improved economics drilling activity in the meramec has produced record setting initial production across our core position in the oil and liquids window at december 31 2017 we had nine operated rigs with drilling focused in the meramec formation in 2018 we plan approximately 700 million of capital investment and expect to accelerate fullfield development activity 

heavy oil – our operations in canada are focused on our heavy oil assets in alberta canada our most significant canadian operation is our jackfish complex an industryleading thermal heavy oil operation in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we employ a recovery method known as steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the jackfish operation consists of three facilities we expect jackfish to maintain a reasonably flat production profile for greater than 20 years requiring approximately 200 million of annual maintenance capital based on current economic conditions 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2017 with our 50 partner we continue to evaluate our development timeline for pike the majority of our pike leasehold does not expire until 2025 and 2026 

in addition to jackfish and pike we hold acreage and own producing assets in the bonnyville region located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta bonnyville is a lowrisk high margin oil development play that produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection

in 2018 we plan approximately 275 million of capital investment in our canadian heavy oil business

eagle ford – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in 2014 with acres located in dewitt and lavaca counties in south texas in 2017 we closed on the sale of our lavaca assets for approximately 200 million since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results by producing 119 million oilequivalent barrels our excellent results are driven by our development in dewitt county located in the economic core of the play with the highest margins in our portfolio our eagle ford assets generated significant cash flow in 2017 in 2018 we plan approximately 250 million of capital investment 

rockies oil – our acreage in the rockies is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin and the wind river basin recent drilling success in these formations has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity as of december 31 2017 we had one operated rig targeting the turner formation in northern converse county of the powder river basin in 2018 we plan approximately 150 million of capital investment 

barnett shale – this is our largest property in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas the johnson county assets are currently being marketed as part of our noncore divestiture program since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to optimize production operations and have transformed this asset into one of the top producing gas fields in north america given the sustained low gas price environment we continue to focus on enhancing existing well performance through refracturing artificial lift and line pressure reduction projects in 2018 we plan on minimal development activity with planned capital investment of up to 50 million to optimize base production and further derisk future development resources 

proved reserves

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 24 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions 

 

index to financial statements 

operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates the group reports to and is managed through our finance department no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked

the director of the group has approximately 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility for the estimation and evaluation of reserves he has been employed by devon for the past 17 years including the past 10 in his current position his further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering registered professional engineer member of the society of petroleum engineers and experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america 

throughout the year the group performs internal reserves reviews of each operating country’s reserves the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2017 we engaged two such firms to audit approximately 88 of our proved reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited approximately 85 of our 2017 us reserves and deloitte llp audited approximately 99 of our canadian reserves

in addition to conducting these internal reviews and external reserves audits we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the members of our reserves committee have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with our thirdparty petroleum consultants

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 14600 gross wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing drilling and construction overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of ga which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2017 of our 43 million net acres approximately 23 million acres are held by production the acreage in the table includes 01 million 02 million and 01 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively as of december 31 2017 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with our expiring acreage of the 04 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2020 we anticipate performing operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2017 we allowed approximately 02 million acres to expire

 



 





title to properties

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry a preliminary title investigation typically consisting of a review of local title records is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties more thorough title investigations which generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

enlink midstream properties 

enlink represents the primary component of our midstream operations enlink’s assets are comprised of systems and other assets located in four primary regions

marketing activities 

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information

as of january 2018 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 



 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2017 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

customers

during 2017 2016 and 2015 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our consolidated sales revenue

public policy and government regulation

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations

 

index to financial statements 

exploration and production regulation 

our operations are subject to federal tribal state provincial and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include



























our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands in addition permitting activities on federal lands are subject to frequent delays

royalties and incentives in canada

the royalty calculation in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of canadian oil and gas production oil sands crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production net of allowed deductions the royalty percentage is determined on a slidingscale based on crown posted prices for prepayout oil sands projects the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered in early 2016 the alberta government adopted the recommendation of its royalty review panel the new royalty framework preserves the existing royalty structure and rates for oil sands for conventional oil and gas royalty calculations  wells drilled after january 1 2017 would use the modernized royalty framework mrf which prescribes a lower royalty rate until allowable costs have been recovered the calculation for wells post payout is based on a percentage of production net of allowed deductions and varies with commodity price 

marketing in canada

any oil or gas export requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations 

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment and natural resources environmental laws and regulations relate to



















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example in recent years nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub prices ranged from a high of over 100 per bbl and 6 per mmbtu respectively to a low of under 27 per bbl and 170 per mmbtu respectively such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to

commodity prices began to decline in the second half of 2014 and despite a moderate recovery have generally been pressured since then this commodity price decline adversely affected our business and results of operations and led to substantial impairments to our oil and gas properties during 2015 a sustained weakness or further deterioration in commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in or exacerbating the following effects











estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development and appraisal activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

 

index to financial statements 

oil and gas operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks 

our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to



















the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property as well as significant liabilities moreover certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant damage to property and natural resources

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business

our operations are subject to extensive federal state provincial tribal local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations

in addition changes in public policy have affected and in the future could further affect our operations regulatory developments could among other things restrict production levels impose price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing pipeline safety seismic activity income taxes and climate change as discussed below

 

index to financial statements 

hydraulic fracturing – in recent years the epa has made proposals that subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and that could potentially restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing for example the epa has issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized in 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a study in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources although the report did not identify a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and impacts to groundwater resources the blm previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017 several states in which we operate have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws andor regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays in development or restrictions on our operations 

pipeline safety – the pipeline assets in which we own interests through enlink or otherwise are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management the phmsa has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas ngl and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids such as oil that in the event of a failure could affect “high consequence areas” additional action by phmsa with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future for example in 2016 phmsa proposed new rules for gas pipelines that extend pipeline safety programs beyond high consequence areas to newly proposed “moderate consequence areas” and would also impose more rigorous testing and reporting requirements on such pipelines to date no further action has been taken more recently in january 2017 phmsa finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain phmsa integrity management requirements ie periodic assessments leak detection and repairs regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area the final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines including all hazardous liquid gathering lines following the change in presidential administrations implementation of this rule was delayed but the final rule is expected to be published in the federal register and become effective during the first quarter of 2018 at this time we cannot predict the cost of such requirements but they could be significant moreover violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties 

seismic activity – earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

 

changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow recently enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform legislation” significantly affects us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations these changes include among others a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax offset by other items intended to broaden the tax base for example by imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and limiting the ability to deduct net operating losses 

 

the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued further compliance with the tax reform legislation and the accounting for such provisions require complex computations and accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced as a result we have provided a provisional estimate in our financial statements of the effect of the tax reform legislation as additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities as accounting treatment is clarified as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect our final analysis which will be recorded in the period completed may be different from our current provisional amounts which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate

climate change – continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane policy makers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor taxes on greenhouse gas emissions for example both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry however following the change in presidential administrations both agencies have published proposed rules that seek to delay implementation of their previously issued methane standards while the agencies review and reconsider both rules nevertheless several states where we operate including wyoming have imposed venting and flaring limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from the use of our products by our customers 

in canada greenhouse gas emissions are also being addressed at both the federal and provincial level recent climate policies include a legislated oil sands emission limit and forthcoming policies include methane emissions reduction targets beginning january 1 2018 large industrial emitters are subject to the carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir this regulation prices carbon but provides cost protection to emissionintensive  tradeexposed industries including devon’s oil sands operations the impact to our operations from these regulations is expected to be minimal in the near term oil and gas facilities that are not subject to the ccir are exempt from the economywide carbon levy until 2023

in addition activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossilfuel energy companies which has resulted in certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities ultimately this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities these various legislative regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business including by imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts moreover as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements including by causing our contract counterparties which are generally financial institutions and other market participants to curtail or cease their derivatives activities

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective share of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties may experience insolvency liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities including contingent liabilities owed to and assumed from us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default by these counterparties may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities which could adversely impact our financial results and condition

 

index to financial statements 

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us 

as of december 31 2017 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 104 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned asset sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices we are currently required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

environmental matters and related costs can be significant

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability

cyber attacks may adversely impact our operations

our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies and we anticipate expanding our use of technology in our operations including through process automation and data analytics concurrent with this growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyberattack activities which have been increasing against our industry cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating sensitive information intellectual property or other assets corrupting data or causing operational disruptions these attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders techniques used in these attacks range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks in addition our vendors midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyber attacks which in turn could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences including litigation risks moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities

limited control on properties operated by others

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

index to financial statements 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets such midstream systems include enlink’s systems as well as other systems operated by us or third parties regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and third parties may be subject to constraints that limit our or their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

insurance does not cover all risks

as discussed above our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil gas and ngls 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk and war our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to







in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analy sis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

overview of 2017 results

during 2017 we generated solid operating results with our strategy of operating in north america’s best resource plays delivering superior execution continuing disciplined capital allocation and maintaining a high degree of financial strength led by our development in the stack and delaware basin we continued to improve our 90day initial production rates with investments in proprietary data tools predictive analytics and artificial intelligence we are delivering industryleading initialrate well productivity performance and improving the performance of our established wells 

compared to 2016 commodity prices increased significantly and were the primary driver for improvements in devon’s earnings and cash flow during 2017 we exited 2017 with liquidity comprised of 27 billion of cash and 29 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility we have no significant debt maturities until 2021

we further enhanced our financial strength by completing approximately 415 million of our announced 1 billion asset divestiture program in 2017 we anticipate closing the remaining divestitures in 2018

in 2018 and beyond we have the financial capacity to further accelerate investment across our bestinclass us resource plays we are increasing drilling activity and will continue to shift our production mix to highmargin products we will continue our premier technical work to drive capital allocation and efficiency and industryleading well productivity results we will continue to maximize the value of our base production by sustaining the operational efficiencies we have achieved finally we will continue to manage activity levels within our cash flows we expect this disciplined approach will position us to deliver capitalefficient cashflow expansion over the next two years 

key measures of our financial performance in 2017 are summarized in the following table increased commodity prices as well as continued focus on our production expenses improved our 2017 financial performance as compared to 2016 as seen in the table below more details for these metrics are found within the “results of operations – 2017 vs 2016” below

market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile therefore we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell during 2017 wti oil prices ranged from approximately 4200bbl to 6000bbl supported by increasing global demand and historically high opec compliance with its oil production cuts that were put in place in 2016 for the first half of 2017 following the decision by both opec and nonopec producers to extend the agreement to reduce output by nearly 18 million barrels per day through the end of 2018 oil prices increased approximately 15 in the fourth quarter of 2017 averaging 5549bbl current market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil in 2018 however changes in opec production strategies the macroeconomic environment geopolitical risks or other factors could impact current forecasts as such we anticipate continued volatility into 2018 and we continue to execute on our hedging strategy to mitigate such volatility 

leveraging the success of our 2017 results we have a solid financial condition and anticipate expanding our oil and gas investment by approximately 10 in 2018 while drilling and completing approximately 25 more wells our 2018 outlook is focused on our high returning assets in the stack and delaware basin and achieving topline oilequivalent production growth of 69 on a retained asset basis through some of our bestinclass positions additionally we continued to execute our hedging program in 2017 and now have approximately 40 of our oil and 50 of our gas production hedged for 2018 with our anticipated results and hedging program we intend to fully fund our increased activity with our operating cash flow additionally we are targeting reducing our debt by approximately 1 billion

finally enlink continues to be a strategic advantage for us with annual distributions to us of approximately 270 million enlink provides a visible cash flow stream to be further invested in our upstream capital programs

results of operations – 2017 vs 2016 

 

the following graphs discussion and analysis are intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations and current financial condition specifically the graph below shows the change in net earnings from 2016 to 2017 the material changes are further discussed by category on the following pages to facilitate the review these numbers are being presented before consideration of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests additional information regarding noncontrolling interests is discussed in note 20 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

the graph below presents the drivers of the upstream operations change presented above with additional details and discussion of the drivers following the graph

 



 

index to financial statements 

 

 

 

 

 



 

oil gas and ngl production

 



 



 



 



 

production declines reduced our upstream revenues by 427 million primarily as a result of our us noncore divestitures that occurred throughout 2016 and 2017 retained production volumes decreased due to reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale these decreases were partially offset by expanded drilling and performance in the stack 

 

oil gas and ngl prices

 



 



 



 



 

 

 

 

index to financial statements 

 

 

 



 

upstream revenues increased 14 billion as a result of higher unhedged realized prices across our entire portfolio the increase in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from higher average wti crude index prices which were 18 higher in 2017 additionally our oil and bitumen sales benefited from tighter differentials to the wti index the increase in gas sales were driven by higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

as further discussed in note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report in 2018 the presentation of certain processing arrangements will change from a net to a gross presentation we estimate the change to increase our upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately 250 million annually with no impact to net earnings 

commodity derivatives

 



 

cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to the instruments described in note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationship between contract prices and the associated forward curves 

production expenses

 



 

loe decreased 100 million primarily due to our noncore us property divestitures in 2016 continued well optimization and cost reduction initiatives across our portfolio have offset industry inflation these initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal power and fuel compression and workovers 

gathering and transportation expense increased 92 million primarily due to a full year of the access pipeline transportation tolls which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our interest in the pipeline our access transportation agreement contains a base transportation commitment which for the initial five years averages 110 million annually 

production taxes increased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the increase in our us upstream revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

property taxes decreased as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas and as a result of our us noncore divestitures 

 



 



 

the overall increase in marketing and midstream operating margin was primarily due to an increase in enlink’s throughput volumes related to gas processing and transmission activities devon’s margins continue to be negatively impacted by downstream marketing commitments we are actively engaged in optimization activities to reduce the costs of downstream commitments however we expect such commitments will continue to negatively impact our margin in 2018 as further discussed in note 1 in “item 8 financials statements and supplementary data” of this report in 2018 enlink’s marketing and midstream revenues are estimated to decrease by 610 with a corresponding decrease to marketing and midstream expenses as a result of complying with the new revenue recognition accounting standard

unproved impairments primarily relate to a portion of acreage in our us noncore operations upon which we do not intend to pursue further exploration and development geological and geophysical costs increased primarily in the stack and delaware basin

 



 



 

our oil and gas dda remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year increases in oil and gas dda rates due to continued development in the stack and delaware basin were offset by reduced production volumes resulting from the 2016 us asset divestitures dda from our midstream and other assets decreased due to the divestiture of the access pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2016

 



 



labor and benefits decreased primarily as a result of the workforce reduction that occurred in february 2016 as discussed in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report nonlabor costs were higher due to an increase in costs related to automation and process improvements reimbursed ga decreased primarily due the divestitures of operated properties in 2016 enlink ga increased primarily due to higher compensation costs

 





 

financing costs net decreased 409 million primarily as a result of our 21 billion early debt retirement in 2016 for further discussion of early retirement premiums and reduced interest expense resulting from our lower debt balances see note 16 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 



 



 

asset impairments in 2016 primarily related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to enlink’s business additional information regarding the impairments is discussed in note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

we recognized gains in conjunction with our noncore us upstream asset dispositions in both 2016 and 2017 and the divestiture of our 50 interest in the access pipeline in 2016 for further discussion see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2016 we recognized restructuring and transaction costs of 267 million primarily as a result of our workforce reduction for discussion of our reorganization programs and the associated restructuring costs see note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

the remaining change in other expense was driven primarily by changes on foreign currency exchange instruments as further discussed in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

index to financial statements 

  



oil gas and ngl production

 



 



 



 



production declines reduced our upstream revenues by 620 million production volumes decreased due to our reduction in exploration and development activity related to our retained assets during 2016 while expanded drilling in the stack and the performance of our jackfish assets drove production increases these production increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale and rockies oil additionally our production decreased as a result of our us noncore divestitures that occurred throughout 2016 

 

oil gas and ngl prices

 



 



 

 



 

  

 

 

index to financial statements 

  



 

upstream revenues decreased 580 million as a result of lower unhedged realized prices for oil bitumen and gas the decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from lower average wti crude index prices which were 11 lower in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decrease in gas sales was driven by lower north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based these decreases were partially offset by slightly higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

commodity derivatives 

 



 

production expenses

 



 

loe and loe per boe decreased as a result of our cost reduction initiatives well optimization and our noncore oil and gas property divestitures on an absolute dollar basis loe decreased approximately 200 million as a result of our us upstream divestitures 

gathering and transportation decreased primarily as a result of us upstream asset divestitures partially offset by 28 million of access pipeline transportation tolls which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our interest in the pipeline

production taxes decreased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the decrease in our us upstream revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

property taxes decreased as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas and as a result of our us noncore divestitures 

 



 



 

the overall decrease was primarily due to lower margins on devon’s downstream marketing commitments offset by enlink’s margin growth largely related to its acquisition activity in late 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 

 



 



 

unproved impairments primarily relate to a portion of acreage in our noncore us operations upon which we do not intend to pursue further exploration and development geological and geophysical costs were lower due to a reduced exploration capital program in 2016

 



 



 

dda from our oil and gas properties decreased largely because of our significant asset impairments recognized in 2015 for discussion on asset impairments see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report enlink’s dda increased primarily due to acquisitions in 2015 and 2016

 

 

 

index to financial statements 

  



 



 

ga decreased due to workforce reductions as discussed in note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report and other cost reduction initiatives in response to the decline in commodity prices reimbursed ga decreased primarily due to a reduction in drilling activity as well as the divestiture of operated properties enlink ga decreased primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and other cost reduction initiatives during 2016

 



financing costs net increased 388 million primarily as a result of our 21 billion early debt retirement for further discussion see note 16 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 



 



 

asset impairments largely related to our oil and gas assets and resulted from a significant decline in forecasted commodity prices during 2015 and 2016 asset impairments for 2016 and 2015 also related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to enlink’s business additional information regarding the impairments is discussed in note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

capital resources uses and liquidity 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of devon and enlink’s cash and cash equivalents

 



 



devon sources and uses of cash

operating cash flow

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2017 our operating cash flow increased 14 billion or 165 as compared to 2016 due to significantly higher commodity prices in 2017 our operating cash flow fully funded our capital expenditure program as well as our dividends

our operating cash flow decreased 34 billion or 80 from 2015 to 2016 while commodity prices decreased from 2015 to 2016 the primary driver of the decrease was due to the expiration of certain favorable hedge positions that provided us with an additional 24 billion of additional operating cash flow in 2015 in 2016 and 2015 our operating cash flow did not fully fund our capital requirements and dividends as a result we utilized available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows 

issuance of common stock

in february 2016 we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters’ option net proceeds from the offering were approximately 15 billion

divestitures of property and investments

during 2017 as part of our announced divestiture program we sold noncore us assets for 415 million for further discussion see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2016 we divested certain noncore upstream assets in the us and our 50 interest in the access pipeline in canada for approximately 30 billion net of purchase price adjustments proceeds from these divestitures were used primarily for debt 

 

index to financial statements 

repayment and to support capital investment in devon’s core resource plays for further discussion see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

we did not have significant current cash income taxes resulting from the divestitures in 2017 and 2016

capital expenditures

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures and property acquisitions

 



 



 

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties our capital program is designed to operate within operating cash flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow this is evidenced by our operating cash flow fully funding capital expenditures in 2017 in response to the lower commodity prices our total capital expenditures have been reduced by approximately 50 since 2015

acquisition costs in 2016 primarily consisted of devon’s bolton acquisition of assets in the stack play for 15 billion approximately 849 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration in 2015 our acquisition activity primarily consisted of the powder river basin asset acquisition in the fourth quarter for further discussion on acquisition activity see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

debt activity net

during 2016 our debt decreased 31 billion the decrease was primarily due to completed tender offers to purchase and redeem 21 billion of debt securities prior to their maturity and a 1 billion reduction in shortterm borrowings in conjunction with the tender offers we recognized a 269 million loss on the early retirement of debt including 265 million of cash retirement costs and fees 

during 2015 our net debt increased 770 million in june 2015 we issued 750 million of 50 senior notes we used these proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes upon maturity on december 15 2015 as well as outstanding commercial paper balances in december 2015 we issued 850 million of 585 senior notes to fund acquisitions announced in the fourth quarter

shareholder distributions

devon paid common stock dividends of 127 million 221 million and 396 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in response to the depressed commodity price environment we reduced our quarterly dividend from 024 to 006 per share in the second quarter of 2016

enlink and general partner distributions

devon received 265 million 265 million and 268 million in distributions from enlink and the general partner during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

 

index to financial statements 

subsidiary unit transactions 

in 2015 we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of 262 million common units representing limited partner interests in enlink raising proceeds of 654 million net of underwriting discount see note 20 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

enlink sources and uses of cash

enlink’s operating cash flow has increased each year since 2015 as a result of the growth experienced from its acquisition activity and continued development activities

capital expenditures for enlink’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines during 2016 enlink acquired anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets for 15 billion approximately 792 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration and debt for additional information on this acquisition see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report enlink’s acquisitions in 2015 consisted of additional oil and gas pipeline assets including gathering transportation and processing facilities 

during 2017 enlink divested its ownership interest in howard energy partners for approximately 190 million proceeds were primarily used to pay a portion of the first 250 million installment payment related to enlink’s 2016 acquisition noted above

during 2017 enlink’s debt increased 247 million in may 2017 enlink issued 500 million of 545 senior notes due in 2047 to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes in june 2017 enlink redeemed its 7125 senior unsecured notes due in 2022 for aggregate cash consideration of 174 million additionally enlink reduced its credit facility borrowings to 74 million during 2017 as noted above enlink made the first installment payment in 2017 related to its 2016 acquisition 

enlink and the general partner distributed 354 million 304 million and 254 million to nondevon unitholders during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

during 2017 2016 and 2015 enlink issued and sold approximately 62 million 100 million and 13 million common units through general public offerings and its “at the market” equity program generating net proceeds of approximately 107 million 167 million and 25 million respectively 

in 2017 enlink issued preferred units in an underwritten public offering generating net proceeds of approximately 394 million

in 2016 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of its acquisition of anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets enlink issued 50 million preferred units in a private placement generating cash proceeds of approximately 725 million general partner common units were also issued as consideration in the transaction 

in 2017 and 2016 enlink received contributions from noncontrolling interests for further discussion see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

devon liquidity

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances available sources of capital and liquidity also include among other things debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec as well as the sale of a portion of our common units representing interests in our investment in enlink and the general partner the most significant source of liquidity in 2017 has come from our operating cash flow supplemented with approximately 415 million of proceeds related to our asset divestitures we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures future debt repayments dividends and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section

 

index to financial statements 

operating cash flow 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil bitumen gas and ngls we produce and sell our consolidated operating cash flow increased 165 in 2017 largely due to increases in commodity prices we expect operating cash flow to continue to be a key source of liquidity as we adjust our capital program to invest within our operating cash flow furthermore proceeds from our noncore asset divestitures will provide additional liquidity as needed

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk we target hedging approximately 50 of our production in a manner that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk management program as it relates to commodity price volatility we supplement the systematic hedging program with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions as a result entering into 2018 we have hedged approximately 40 of our anticipated oil and 50 of our anticipated gas production the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2017 are presented in note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices

divestitures of property and equipment – in 2017 we announced a program to divest approximately 1 billion of upstream assets these noncore assets identified for monetization include select portions of the barnett shale focused primarily in and around johnson county and other properties located principally within devon’s us resource base through december 31 2017 devon completed divestiture transactions totaling approximately 415 million the most significant asset remaining in this program is select barnett shale properties which we expect to close in 2018 

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2017 we had total debt of 69 billion that bears fixed interest rates averaging 57 

as of december 31 2017 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

at the end of 2017 we held approximately 26 billion of cash included in this total was 732 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 

credit availability 

we have a 30 billion senior credit facility the maturity date for 164 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2018 the maturity date for the remaining 28 billion is october 24 2019 this credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2017 there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 16 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our 

 

index to financial statements 

outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as oil and gas property impairments and goodwill impairments as of december 31 2017 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2017 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 272 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness we are currently targeting up to 15 billion of debt reduction in 2018

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s financial services is bbb with a stable outlook in march 2017 fitch ratings affirmed our bbb rating and revised our outlook to stable from negative in april 2017 moody’s investor service upgraded our credit rating from ba2 to ba1 with a stable outlook any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our or enlink’s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however a downgrade could adversely impact our and enlink’s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

capital expenditures

our 2018 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately 22 billion to 24 billion and funded within operating cash flow although negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would impact our operating cash flow we likely would not change our 2018 planned capital investment should our operating cash flow decrease from our forecasts we could divest noncore assets to balance capital sources and uses 

enlink liquidity

enlink has a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the general partner has a 250 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017 there were 10 million in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the 15 billion credit facility and 74 million outstanding borrowings under the 250 million credit facility all of enlink’s and the general partner’s debt is nonrecourse to devon 

as of december 31 2017 enlink had total debt of 35 billion of this amount 34 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 46 and 74 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 32

enlink’s 2018 capital budget includes approximately 600 million to 800 million of identified growth projects enlink’s primary capital projects for 2018 include the construction of the thunderbird processing plant in central oklahoma the lobo iii processing plant in the delaware basin and the development of additional gathering and compression assets in central oklahoma and the permian basin

 

index to financial statements 

enlink expects to fund the growth capital expenditures with borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from other debt and equity sources including capital contributions by joint venture partners enlink expects to fund its 2018 maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows enlink employs a strategy that includes maintaining stable operating cash flows that are supported by longterm fixedfee contracts approximately 94 of enlink’s cash flows were generated from feebased services in 2017 it is possible that not all of the planned projects for 2018 will be commenced or completed enlink’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond its control 

contractual obligations

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

oil and gas assets accounting reserves classification  valuation

change in accounting principle

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we changed our method of accounting for our oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method in accordance with fasb asc 250 “ accounting changes and error corrections” financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method as prescribed by the fasb asc 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” as required by asc 250 we have presented the accumulated effect of the change in accounting principle from devon’s inception to december 31 2014 as a change in the beginning balance of our 2015 consolidated statements of equity

to recast our financial statements we made certain critical estimates judgments and assumptions to apply successful efforts accounting to our historical operations these critical items are similar to those pertaining to our ongoing successful efforts accounting which are described below for additional information regarding the effects of the change to the successful efforts method including our underlying successful efforts accounting policies see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

to illustrate the effect of the change to successful efforts accounting the following table summarizes the 19 billion increase to our historical equity as of september 30 2017 the date of our conversion the increase was primarily driven by lower impairments offset by higher dda and less capitalized expenses 

 



 

 

index to financial statements 

reserves 

our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dda calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by thirdparty petroleum consulting firms in 2017 88 of our reserves were subjected to such audits

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

 

successful efforts method of accounting and classification

we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves which is a critical estimate discussed in the previous section the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize then subject to dda calculations and impairment assessments and valuations

 

once a well is drilled the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience development wells are always capitalized costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized or suspended pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed when making this determination management considers current activities nearterm plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings otherwise the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized at december 31 2017 devon had approximately 200 million of well costs suspended for more than one year which largely pertain to its pike heavy oil project stratigraphic testing has demonstrated reserves can be produced economically at pike however this capital intensive longduration project remains unsanctioned by devon and its 50 partner which is the primary reason reserves have not been designated as proven at pike with no lease expiration at pike in the near future management continues to keep the pike exploratory costs capitalized

 

similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs costs for undeveloped leasehold for which reserves have not been proven must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment at the end of each quarter management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans drilling activity results commodity price outlooks planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects based on this assessment devon impaired 139 million of undeveloped leasehold in the fourth quarter of 2017 at december 31 2017 devon had 14 billion of undeveloped leasehold and capitalized interest which includes approximately 750 million related to pike consistent with the evaluation above on suspended well costs the costs for pike continue to remain capitalized of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31 2017 85 million is scheduled to expire in 2018 the leasehold expiring in 2018 relates to areas in which devon is actively drilling if our drilling is not successful this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired 

valuation of longlived assets

longlived assets used in operations including proved and unproved oil and gas properties are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group for dda calculations and impairment assessments management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level “common operating field” for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the determination of common operating fields is largely based 

 

index to financial statements 

on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition which requires judgment management also considers the nature of production common infrastructure common sales points common processing plants common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations these determinations impact the amount of dda recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment 

management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices volumes and future development plans are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for longlived assets the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes commodity prices operating costs and capital investment plans considering all available information at the date of review besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pretax cash flows for our impairment determinations we generally utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years we estimate and escalate or deescalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history changes to any of these assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pretax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of impairments due to suppressed commodity prices in 2015 and 2016 we recognized significant asset impairments in each of those years with more stabilized and higher pricing in 2017 we did not recognize material asset impairments 

goodwill and other intangibles

goodwill

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable while we use data as of october 31 for our test we typically complete the test in late december or early january as the october 31 market data used in our test becomes available 

we assess the qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses including comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations operating margins and capital expenditures

for the october 31 2017 impairment tests for devon’s us reporting unit and each of enlink’s reporting units the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value

sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices together with a decline in the enlink unit price caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test for enlink’s reporting units in 2015 and an update to be performed at december 31 2015 using the fair value approaches described above it was determined that the estimated fair value of enlink’s texas louisiana and crude and condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts and a goodwill impairment loss of 492 million 787 million and 49 million respectively was recognized in 2015

additionally another interim impairment test was warranted during 2016 for enlink’s reporting units using the fair value approaches described above it was determined that the estimated fair value of enlink’s texas general partner and crude and condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts and a goodwill impairment loss of 473 million 307 million and 93 million respectively was recognized in 2016

our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments as discussed above differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations if actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges which would be recognized in the period in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value we would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of 

 

index to financial statements 

future operating results which could result in future goodwill impairments for our reporting units due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations 

the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized

other intangible assets

in 2015 the assessment of customer relationships was updated due to the factors described in the aforementioned goodwill section this assessment resulted in a 223 million impairment of other intangible assets related to enlink’s crude and condensate reporting unit level 3 fair value measurements were utilized for the impairment analysis of definitelived intangible assets which included discounted cash flow estimates consistent with those utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment

the other intangible assets impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized

income taxes

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at the end of 2017 and 2016 we had deferred tax assets that largely resulted from the asset impairments recognized throughout 2016 as a result of our recent cumulative losses and our current realization assessment we recorded a 100 valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 further in 2017 we recognized a 660 million partial valuation allowance against certain canadian deferred tax assets as a result of the canadian legal entity restructuring 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

 

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing us income tax laws particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and repatriations of foreign earnings changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 

 

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities

 









 

 

index to financial statements 

because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impractical to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies 

under the tax reform legislation the corporate income tax rate was reduced to 21 effective january 1 2018 we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date as the tax reform legislation was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of the transition tax deferred tax remeasurements and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118

absent unexpected events and unexpected effects of the tax reform legislation devon expects a positive impact on its future aftertax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate

nongaap measures

we make reference to “core earnings loss attributable to devon” and “core earnings loss per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2017 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures core earnings attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure items may appear to be recurring when comparing on an annual basis in the table below restructuring and transaction costs were incurred in two of the three year periods however these costs relate to different restructuring programs amounts excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset impairments included in exploration expenses us tax reform changes deferred tax asset valuation allowance derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early retirement of debt 

amounts excluded for 2016 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses rig stacking costs deferred tax asset valuation allowance restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 workforce reduction derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and costs associated with early retirement of debt

amounts excluded for 2015 relate to asset dispositions noncash asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses rig stacking costs deferred tax asset valuation allowance restructuring and transaction costs derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and repatriation of funds to the us 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts which typically make similar adjustments in their estimates of our financial results we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

 item 7a quantitative and qual itative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2017 are presented in note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2017 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by approximately 260 million

 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2017 we had total debt of 104 billion of this amount 103 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 53 and approximately 74 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 32

as of december 31 2017 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 4 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the three month libor rate a 10 change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet or liquidity at december 31 2017

foreign currency risk

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2017 balance sheet

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however some of these subsidiaries hold canadiandollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are based in canadian dollars the value of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the us dollar functional currency based on the amount of the cash and intercompany loans as of december 31 2017 a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

 item 9a controls and procedure s

disclosure controls and procedures

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to devon including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors

based on their evaluation our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 were effective as of december 31 2017 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by devon in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for devon as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 under the supervision and with the participation of devon’s management including our principal executive and principal financial officers we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “2013 coso framework” based on this evaluation under the 2013 coso framework which was completed on february 21 2018 management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2017

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 as stated in their report which is included under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

changes in internal control over financial reporting

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we added and modified certain internal control processes as a result of changing our method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

devon strategy

devon is committed to delivering consistent topquartile shareholder return among its peer group through a highly engaged culture focused on innovation safety operational excellence environmental stewardship and social responsibility we also maintain a strong commitment to financial strength and flexibility through all commodity price cycles as reflected in the company’s investment grade credit ratings we focus our business on building value per share by









our formidable portfolio of exploration and production assets and operations provides stable environmentally responsible production and a platform for future growth for devon 2016 was a transformational year as we executed our strategy we successfully reshaped our asset portfolio with noncore divestitures and the continued development of our worldclass operations in the stack and delaware basin these assets provide us with a sustainable multidecade growth platform that continues to improve in response to our successful drilling programs during 2016 we delivered the best well productivity in devon’s 45year history and continued a fouryear streak of increasing devon’s initial 90day production rates devon has more than doubled its onshore north american oil 

 

index to financial statements 

production since 2011 and has a deep inventory of development opportunities to deliver future oil growth adding to these operational highlights we had several key actions in 2016 as discussed below 

















as we enter 2017 and continue to look toward the future we will approach the current environment in a manner that drives efficiencies across our portfolio we will manage activity levels within our cash flow by achieving additional operating cost savings and increasing capital productivity while remaining committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner that is driven by both value and return we believe we capture the full value of our assets and improve returns through maximizing our base production and optimizing our capital program the activities that support this strategy include minimizing controllable downtime enhancing well productivity ensuring disciplined project execution performing premier technical work focusing on developmental drilling and reducing our operating and capital costs

enlink strategy

enlink focuses on providing gathering transmission processing storage fractionation and marketing to upstream oil and natural gas producers including devon 

enlink connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems processes natural gas for the removal of ngls fractionates ngls into purity products and markets those products for a fee transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets furthermore enlink purchases natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities industrial consumers other marketers and pipelines

enlink’s primary business objective is to provide cash flow stability while growing through prudent and profitable investments enlink accomplishes its objectives through longterm feebased contracts and maintaining a strong financial position through a conservative and balanced capital structure highlighted by its investment grade status enlink has consistently demonstrated expertise within the mlp space and continues to employ a proven business model that includes growing expanding and executing on its strategy within top basins where devon and other successful upstream producers operate

led by results from the stack delaware basin and eagle ford devon achieved the best drilling results in our 45year history our initial 90day production rates in 2016 increased for the fourth consecutive year advancing more than 300 from 2012 levels these productivity improvements were driven by activity focused in top resource plays improved subsurface reservoir characterization leadingedge completion designs and improvements in lateral placement excluding the effects of divestitures our drilling results increased our proved reserves in 2016 on a retained asset basis by 3 the most significant reserves growth came from our us operations where we replaced approximately 175 of our 2016 production 

barnett shale – this is our largest property in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to optimize production operations and have transformed this asset into one of the top producing gas fields in north america given the sustained low gas price environment we continue to focus on enhancing existing well performance through refracturing artificial lift and line pressure reduction projects in 2017 we plan on minimal development activity with planned capital investment of up to 50 million to optimize base production and further derisk future development activity 

delaware basin – the delaware basin is one of devon’s toptwo franchise assets and continues to offer exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring delaware wolfcamp and leonard formations these oil and liquidsrich opportunities across our acreage in the delaware basin will offer highmargin growth for many years to come at december 31 2016 we had three operated rigs in 2017 we plan to invest approximately 700 million of capital in the delaware basin and steadily ramp up activity with as many as 10 operated rigs running by the end of the year primarily focused on the bone spring leonard and wolfcamp formations 

eagle ford – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in 2014 from geosouthern and have approximately 66000 net acres located in dewitt and lavaca counties in south texas since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results by producing 94 million oilequivalent barrels our excellent results are driven by our development in dewitt county located in the economic core of the play with the highest margins in our portfolio our eagle ford assets generated approximately 550 million of direct cash margin in 2016 in 2017 we plan approximately 175 million of capital investment 

 

index to financial statements 

heavy oil – our operations in canada are focused on our heavy oil assets in alberta canada our most significant canadian operation is our jackfish complex an industryleading thermal heavy oil operation in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we employ a recovery method known as steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the jackfish operation consists of three facilities in 2014 we brought the third phase of jackfish into operation which ramped up to facility capacity by the third quarter of 2015 at 55bbl wti direct cash margin from our heavy oil assets has the potential to approach 800 million in 2017 we expect jackfish to maintain a reasonably flat production profile for greater than 20 years requiring only approximately 200 million of annual maintenance capital based on current economic conditions 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2016 with our 50 partner we continue to evaluate our development timeline for pike

in addition to jackfish and pike we hold acreage and own producing assets in the bonnyville region located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta bonnyville is a lowrisk high margin oil development play that produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection

in 2017 we plan approximately 300 million of capital investment in our canadian heavy oil business

rockies oil – our acreage in the rockies includes approximately 470000 net surface acres focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin and the wind river basin recent drilling success in these formations has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity as of december 31 2016 we had one operated rig targeting the parkman teapot and turner formations within the cretaceous oil objectives of the powder river basin in 2017 we plan approximately 175 million of capital investment 

stack  – the stack development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties is one of devon’s toptwo franchise assets devon has two primary fields in the area the woodford shale and the meramec in 2016 we increased our acreage in these positions by acquiring 80000 net acres in the stack our acreage in the play now includes approximately 430000 net acres our stack position is the largest and one of the best in the industry providing visible longterm growth recent wellcompletion design enhancements have resulted in greater productivity and improved economics early drilling activity in the meramec play has produced record setting results across our core position in the oil and liquids window at december 31 2016 we had six operated rigs with drilling focused in the meramec formation in 2017 we plan approximately 750 million of capital investment and expect to continue to increase drilling activity throughout 2017 and run up to 10 operated rigs by the end of the year 

proved reserves

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each property see note 22 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group 

 

index to financial statements 

the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates the group reports to and is managed through our finance department no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked

the director of the group has approximately 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility for the estimation and evaluation of reserves he has been employed by devon for the past 16 years including the past nine in his current position his further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum engineering registered professional engineer member of the society of petroleum engineers and experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america 

throughout the year the group performs internal reserves audits of each operating division’s reserves the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2016 we engaged two such firms to audit 89 of our proved reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited 86 of our 2016 us reserves and deloitte llp audited 96 of our canadian reserves

in addition to conducting these internal and external reserves audits we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with our thirdparty petroleum consultants

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2016 of our 46 million net acres approximately 24 million acres are held by production the acreage in the table includes 03 million 02 million and 01 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively as of december 31 2016 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with our expiring acreage of the 06 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2019 we will perform operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2016 we allowed approximately 03 million acres to expire which is consistent with expirations in prior years

 



 





title to properties

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties title investigations which generally include a review of title opinions of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

enlink midstream properties

enlink represents the primary component of our midstream operations enlink’s assets are comprised of systems and other assets located in four primary regions

marketing activities 

oil gas and ngl marketing

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices

additionally we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information

as of january 2017 our production was sold under the following contract terms

 



 

delivery commitments

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2016 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production

 



 

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves moreover our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments

customers

during 2016 2015 and 2014 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our consolidated sales revenue

public policy and government regulation

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or 

 

index to financial statements 

expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation

our operations are subject to federal tribal state provincial and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include



























our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the blm or bureau of indian affairs of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government tribes or tribal members the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands in addition permitting activities on federal lands are subject to frequent delays

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty calculation in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of canadian oil and gas production oil sands crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production net of allowed deductions the royalty percentage is determined on a slidingscale based on crown posted prices for prepayout oil sands projects the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered in early 2016 the alberta government adopted the recommendation of its royalty review panel the new royalty framework preserves the existing royalty structure and rates for oil sands for conventional oil and gas royalty calculations for wells drilled after january 1 2017 in the modernized royalty framework the calculation is based on a percentage of production net of allowed deductions

marketing in canada

any oil or gas export requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board 

environmental pipeline safety and occupational regulations

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to

















failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas moreover multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon

 

index to financial statements 

volatile oil gas and ngl prices significantly impact our business 

our financial condition results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile for example during the period from january 1 2014 to december 31 2016 nymex wti oil prices ranged from a high of 10726 per bbl to a low of 2621 per bbl average daily prices for nymex henry hub gas ranged from a high of 615 per mmbtu to a low of 164 per mmbtu during the same period such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to





























in the second half of 2014 global energy commodity prices began a rapid and significant decline which continued through 2015 and into 2016 this commodity price decline adversely affected our business and results of operations and led to substantial impairments to our oil and gas properties during 2015 and 2016 a sustained weakness or further deterioration in commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in or exacerbating the following effects











estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain and may be subject to revision

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a 

 

index to financial statements 

given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs

our exploration and development activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to



















the occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property and certain of these events particularly equipment failures or accidents could impact third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant property damage

 

index to financial statements 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state provincial tribal local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental matters worker health and safety wildlife conservation the gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling completion and well operations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations

in addition changes in public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations regulatory developments could among other things restrict production levels impose price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing pipeline safety seismic activity income taxes and climate change as discussed below

hydraulic fracturing – the epa and other federal agencies including the blm have made proposals that would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and could restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing for example the epa has issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized in june 2016 regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa also released a study in december 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices could result in impacts to water resources although the report did not identify a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and impacts to groundwater resources the blm and several states have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws andor regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays in development or restrictions on our operations 

pipeline safety – the pipeline assets in which we own interests through enlink or otherwise are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management the phmsa has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas ngl and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids such as oil that in the event of a failure could affect “high consequence areas” additional action by phmsa with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future for example in march 2016 phmsa proposed new rules for gas pipelines that extend pipeline safety programs beyond high consequence areas to newly proposed “moderate consequence areas” and would also impose more rigorous testing and reporting requirements on such pipelines more recently in january 2017 phmsa finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain phmsa integrity management requirements ie periodic assessments leak detection and repairs regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area the final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines including all hazardous liquid gathering lines at this time we cannot predict the cost of such requirements but they could be significant moreover violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties 

 

index to financial statements 

seismic activity – recent earthquakes in northern and central oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation that could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we are currently defending against certain thirdparty lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

 

potential changes to tax laws – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow in past years legislation has been proposed that would if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws including to certain key us federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies such legislative changes have included but not been limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures congress could consider and could include some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation to accompany lower federal income tax rates moreover other more general features of tax reform legislation including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could take effect the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

climate change – policy makers in the us and canada are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policy makers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor taxes on greenhouse gas emissions for example both the epa and the blm have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from the use of our products by our customers although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

 

in 2015 alberta released a new climate leadership plan this plan includes implementing an economywide carbon price effective in 2017 the plan also includes a legislated limit for oil sands emissions and a methane emission reduction plan which are under development regulations are expected to be finalized by 2018 it is expected that these initiatives will create additional costs for the alberta oil and gas industry presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any law or regulations developed

our hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and involve other risks 

we enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from 

 

index to financial statements 

commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts moreover as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other legislation hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have come under increasing governmental oversight and regulations in recent years although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws and the related rulemaking some of which is ongoing existing or future regulations may adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements including by causing our contract counterparties which are generally financial institutions and other market participants to curtail or cease their derivatives activities 

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties may experience liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment any such default by these counterparties could adversely impact our financial results

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us

as of december 31 2016 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 102 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to







in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned assets sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices during 2016 standard  poor’s financial services and moody’s investor service downgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings due to our current credit ratings we are required to provide letters of credit or other assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements further downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt 

environmental matters and related costs can be significant

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment 

 

index to financial statements 

these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

cyber attacks targeting our systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations

our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct daily operations concurrently the industry has become the subject of increased levels of cyberattack activity cyber attacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption and may be carried out by third parties or insiders the techniques utilized range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities

limited control on properties operated by others

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays curtailments or cancellations of operations or future development which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our gas production and to transport our oil gas and ngl production to downstream markets such midstream systems include enlink’s systems as well as other systems operated by us or third parties regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and third parties may be subject to constraints that limit our or their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability

insurance does not cover all risks

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to people or loss of life 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well 

 

index to financial statements 

control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk and war our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties typically during times of rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase during these periods there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to







in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analy sis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

overview of 2016 results

by executing on our strategy outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis despite the challenges our company and the entire upstream energy sector have faced from the sustained low commodity price environment we have continued to execute our strategy and position our company for longterm success although we have seen moderate improvements in oil and natural gas prices over the course of 2016 prices for oil and natural gas were still significantly lower than 2015 and 2014 and remain under pressure due to excess supply concerns in response to this environment we remained committed to an approach centered on



 



 



 



to that end in 2016 we



















in 2017 and beyond we have the financial capacity to further accelerate investment across our bestinclass us resource plays we are increasing drilling activity and will continue to rapidly shift our production mix to highmargin products we will continue our premier technical work to drive capital allocation and efficiency and industryleading well productivity results we will continue to maximize the value of our base production by sustaining the operational efficiencies we have achieved finally we will continue to manage activity levels within our cash flows we expect this disciplined approach will position us to deliver substantial cash flow expansion over the next two years 

 

index to financial statements 

in addition we recognized 267 million of restructuring and transaction costs during 2016 related to the workforce reduction and incurred 50 billion of noncash asset impairments as a result of the continued depressed prices for commodities but recognized 19 billion in gains on our divestiture transactions while the gain on divestitures and impairments significantly impacted our earnings they had no effect on our operating cash flow or debt covenants 

 

key measures of our financial performance in 2016 are summarized in the following table

 



 





our 2016 net loss and net loss per share improved compared to 2015 primarily due to more significant noncash asset impairments recognized in 2015 as a result of the large commodity price declines core loss core loss per share and operating cash flow for 2016 decreased significantly compared to 2015 as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices and the expiration of certain favorable commodity hedging positions

business and industry outlook

devon marked its 45th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 28th year as a public company during 2016 as an established company with a strong leadership team we have experience operating in periods of challenged commodity prices with our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets we are prepared to successfully navigate the current environment while ensuring our longterm financial strength

market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile therefore we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell during 2016 oil prices ranged from 2621bbl to 5406bbl as a result of the ongoing worldwide oversupply issue opec agreed to its first oil production cut in eight years in november 2016 following the agreements by both opec and nonopec producers to reduce output by nearly 18 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017 oil prices jumped approximately 10 in the fourth quarter of 2016 averaging 4921bbl current market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids in 2017 however changes in opec production strategies the macroeconomic environment geopolitical risks winter and summer temperature ranges or other factors could impact current forecasts as such we anticipate continued volatility into 2017

while we expect that our industry will remain challenged by relatively low prices for the nearterm we have strategically positioned our company for continued growth and investment in our portfolio of assets leveraging the success of our 2016 divestiture program and other key achievements noted above we are in a position of significant strength and anticipate expanding our exploration and development capital spend by approximately 80 in 2017 our 2017 outlook is marked by accelerated activity across our key basins focusing an expanded rig count in the stack and delaware basin and achieving 15 growth in us oil production through some of our bestinclass positions additionally we ramped up our hedging program in 2016 with approximately 50 of our oil and 45 of our gas production hedged entering into 2017 

finally enlink continues to be a strategic advantage for us allowing for improved midstream growth potential annual distributions of approximately 270 million provide a visible cash flow stream to be further invested in our upstream capital programs discussed above

commodity sales

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales

 



 

volumes 2016 vs 2015 commodity sales decreased due to our 67 reduction in exploration and development capital related to our retained assets during 2016 while expanded drilling in the stack and the performance of our jackfish assets drove production increases these production increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale and rockies oil delaware basin production was relatively flat as natural declines offset the increases from new wells additionally our production decreased as a result of our us noncore divestiture program 

volumes 2015 vs 2014 commodity sales increased due to volumes in 2015 because of strong production growth from our us oil properties the growth was primarily driven by the continued development of our eagle 

 

index to financial statements 

ford delaware basin and rockies oil properties additionally our bitumen production increased primarily due to jackfish 3 coming online late in the third quarter of 2014 and reaching nameplate capacity in the third quarter of 2015 lower royalties resulting from the significant price decrease also increased our heavy oil production the increases were partially offset by a decrease in our gas production which resulted primarily from asset divestitures in 2014 and natural reservoir declines 

prices 2016 vs 2015 commodity sales decreased in 2016 as a result of lower prices for oil bitumen and gas the decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from lower average wti crude oil index prices which were approximately 11 lower in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decreases in gas were driven by lower north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based these decreases were partially offset by slightly higher ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

prices 2015 vs 2014 commodity sales decreased in 2015 as a result of significantly lower prices for all commodities the decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from significantly lower average wti crude oil index prices which were approximately 50 lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 the decreases in gas and ngl sales were driven by lower north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

oil gas and ngl derivatives

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses

cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments a summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars and basis swaps

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives incurred a net loss in 2016 and generated net gains in 2015 and 2014

marketing and midstream revenues and operating expenses

 



2016 vs 2015 the overall decrease in marketing and midstream margin during 2016 was primarily due to lower margins on devon’s downstream marketing commitments offset by enlink’s margin growth largely related to its acquisition activity in late 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we anticipate the margins on devon’s downstream marketing commitments to continue to negatively impact our marketing and midstream margins into 2017 

 

index to financial statements 

2015 vs 2014 marketing and midstream operating profit changes were largely driven by a decrease in devon’s marketing activities due to a decrease in commodity prices these declines were partially offset by a full year of enlink’s legacy asset operations compared to prior year and facility expansions coming online in late 2014 along with assets acquired during 2015 

asset dispositions and other

during 2016 we recognized gains of 19 billion in conjunction with the noncore us upstream asset divestitures and the divestiture of our 50 interest in the access pipeline in canada during 2014 in conjunction with the divestiture of certain canadian properties we recognized gains of 11 billion for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

lease operating expenses

 



 

2016 vs 2015 loe and loe per boe decreased during 2016 primarily due to our well optimization and cost reduction initiatives as well as our noncore oil and gas property divestitures on an absolute dollar basis loe decreased approximately 200 million as a result of our us upstream divestitures and we anticipate realizing approximately 100 million in additional loe savings in 2017 as a result of these divestitures our cost reduction initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal power and fuel compression and workovers these cost savings were partially offset by 28 million of access pipeline transportation tolls which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our interest in access our access transportation agreement contains a base transportation commitment which for the initial five years averages 110 million annually 

2015 vs 2014 loe per boe decreased during 2015 primarily as a result of higher jackfish 3 volumes our well optimization and cost reduction initiatives lower royalties and changes in the canadian to us foreign exchange rate as canadian royalties decrease our net production volumes increase causing improvements to our perunit operating costs the flat us rate is primarily related to our 2014 noncore natural gas asset divestitures and our oil production growth where projects generate higher margins but generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our retained and divested gas projects 

 

index to financial statements 

general and administrative expenses 

 



 

2016 vs 2015 gross ga and capitalized ga decreased during 2016 largely due to lower devon employee costs resulting from workforce reductions as discussed in note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report and other cost reduction initiatives reimbursed ga decreased primarily due to a reduction in drilling activity in response to the decline in commodity prices as well as the divestiture of operated properties enlink net ga decreased primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and other cost reductions initiatives during 2016 

 

2015 vs 2014 gross ga decreased during 2015 largely because of a lower employee performance bonus pool and our cost reduction initiatives furthermore 22 million in onetime costs related to the enlink and geosouthern transactions contributed to higher costs in the first quarter of 2014 reimbursed ga decreased subsequent to our 2014 asset divestitures enlink ga increased primarily due to a workforce increase associated with enlink’s 2015 acquisitions 

production and property taxes

 



2016 vs 2015 production taxes decreased on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to the decrease in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed furthermore property and other taxes decreased as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing authorities across our key operating areas and as a result of our us noncore divestitures property taxes do not change in direct correlation with the decline in oil gas and ngl sales and are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 

 

2015 vs 2014 production taxes decreased during 2015 primarily because of a decrease in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed

depreciation depletion and amortization 

 



 

a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes

2016 vs 2015 dda from our oil and gas properties decreased largely because of the significant asset impairments recognized throughout 2015 and 2016 for discussion of asset impairments see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report enlink’s dda increased primarily due to enlink acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 

2015 vs 2014 dda from our oil and gas properties decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 largely because of the 2014 divestitures of certain us and canadian assets and the oil and gas asset impairments recognized in 2015 enlink’s dda increased primarily due to enlink’s acquisitions in 2014 and 2015 

asset impairments

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized asset impairments of 50 billion 208 billion and 20 billion respectively for discussion of asset impairments see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

restructuring and transaction costs

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized restructuring and transaction costs of 267 million 78 million and 46 million respectively for discussion of our reorganization programs and the associated restructuring costs see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

 

index to financial statements 

net financing costs 

 



 

2016 vs 2015 net financing costs increased during 2016 primarily as a result of the retirement premiums and costs related to early redemptions of senior notes in 2016 which is further discussed in note 14 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report furthermore net financing costs increased due to enlink’s fixed rate borrowings and accretion of its future installment payments related to 2016 acquisition activity discussed in note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

2015 vs 2014 net financing costs decreased primarily because of the 2014 early retirement premium and costs and a decrease in average fixedrate borrowings

capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents

 



 

operating cash flow

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2016 our operating cash flow decreased 36 billion or 68 during 2016 throughout 2015 our commodity hedges provided us with 24 billion of additional operating cash flow the majority of these hedges expired in 2015 and were the primary driver of our decrease in operating cash flow in 2016 the remainder of the decrease is primarily related to the continued decrease in commodity prices partially offset by our focused cost initiatives 

our operating cash flow decreased 10 during 2015 primarily due to lower commodity prices the effects of lower commodity prices were partially offset by the collection of 425 million of income taxes receivable in the first quarter of 2015 and 24 billion of cash settlements associated with our commodity derivatives during 2015

excluding payments made for acquisitions our consolidated operating cash flow funded 75 100 and 86 of our capital expenditures during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in 2016 2015 and 2014 leveraging our liquidity and other capital resources we also used cash balances shortterm debt proceeds from enlink transactions and divestiture proceeds to fund our acquisitions dividends and capital requirements

issuance of common stock

in february 2016 we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters’ option net proceeds from the offering were approximately 15 billion

 

index to financial statements 

divestitures of property and equipment 

during 2016 we divested certain noncore upstream assets in the us and our 50 interest in the access pipeline in canada for approximately 30 billion net of purchase price adjustments proceeds from these divestitures were used primarily for debt repayment and to support capital investment in devon’s core resource plays we did not have significant current cash income taxes resulting from these divestitures for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

during 2014 we divested certain noncore upstream assets in the us and canada for approximately 51 billion these proceeds were used primarily for debt repayment relating to the geosouthern transaction for additional discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

capital expenditures

 



 

capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations other corporate activities and enlink growth and maintenance activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties in response to our lower operating cash flow devon’s 2016 capital program was designed to be lower than 2015 this change is evidenced by a 56 decrease in total capital expenditures from 2015 to 2016 excluding acquisitions since 2014 we have reduced our capital expenditures by approximately 70

capital expenditures for devon’s and enlink’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling and development activities 

acquisition capital in 2016 primarily consisted of devon’s bolton acquisition of assets in the stack play for 15 billion and enlink’s acquisition of anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets for 15 billion approximately 849 million and 792 million respectively was paid in cash at the closings with the remainder of the purchase prices funded with equity consideration and debt in 2015 our acquisition activity primarily consisted of the powder river basin asset acquisition in the fourth quarter the majority of the acquisition capital in 2014 related to the geosouthern acquisition in the eagle ford enlink’s acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 consisted of additional oil and gas pipeline assets including gathering transportation and processing facilities for further discussion on acquisition activity see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

debt activity net

during 2016 our consolidated net debt decreased 29 billion the decrease was primarily due to completed tender offers to purchase and redeem 21 billion of debt securities prior to their maturity and a 1 billion reduction in shortterm borrowings during 2016 in conjunction with the tender offers we recognized a 269 million loss on the early retirement of debt including 265 million of cash retirement costs and fees the decrease was partially 

 

index to financial statements 

offset by 229 million of net borrowings from enlink for additional information see note 14 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report 

during 2015 our consolidated net debt increased 18 billion in june 2015 we issued 750 million of 50 senior notes we used these proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes upon maturity on december 15 2015 as well as outstanding commercial paper balances in december 2015 we issued 850 million of 585 senior notes to fund acquisitions announced in the fourth quarter enlink’s net debt borrowings increased 11 billion primarily from borrowings made to fund acquisitions and dropdowns

during 2014 we decreased our net debt by 22 billion the decrease was primarily related to the repayment of debt used to fund the geosouthern transaction this was partially offset by 555 million of net borrowings from enlink to fund its operations

shareholder and noncontrolling interests distributions

the following table summarizes our common stock dividends 

 



 

in response to the depressed commodity price environment we reduced our quarterly dividend to 006 per share in the second quarter of 2016

in conjunction with the formation of enlink in the first quarter of 2014 we made a payment of 100 million to noncontrolling interests furthermore enlink and the general partner distributed 304 million 254 million and 135 million to nondevon unitholders during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

enlink and general partner distributions

devon received 265 million 268 million and 158 million in distributions from enlink and the general partner during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

enlink dropdowns 

in the second quarter of 2015 devon received 167 million in cash from enlink in exchange for vex for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

issuance of subsidiary units

in january 2016 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of its acquisition of anadarko basin gathering and processing midstream assets enlink issued 50 million preferred units in a private placement generating cash proceeds of approximately 725 million general partner common units were also issued as consideration in the transaction 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 enlink issued and sold approximately 100 million 13 million and 148 million common units through general public offerings and its “at the market” equity program generating net proceeds of approximately 167 million 25 million and 410 million respectively 

sale of subsidiary units

in early 2015 we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of 262 million common units representing limited partner interests in enlink raising proceeds of 654 million net of underwriting discount see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

effect of exchange rate and other

in 2016 enlink received contributions from noncontrolling interests for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

liquidity

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances available sources of capital and liquidity include among other things debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec as well as the sale of a portion of our common units representing interests in our investment in enlink and the general partner the most significant source of liquidity in 2016 has come from approximately 30 billion of proceeds related to our asset divestitures we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures future debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section

operating cash flow

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil bitumen gas and ngls we produce and sell our consolidated operating cash flow decreased 68 in 2016 as a result of the expiration of certain favorable commodity hedging positions and the continued decrease in commodity prices in spite of this decline we expect operating cash flow to continue to be a primary source of liquidity as we adjust our capital program in response to lower commodity prices additionally we anticipate utilizing our credit availability to provide additional liquidity as needed

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control as a result entering into 2017 we have hedged approximately 50 of our oil and 45 of our gas production the key 

 

index to financial statements 

terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2016 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2016 we had total debt of 102 billion of this amount 100 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 53 and approximately 150 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 25 

as of december 31 2016 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

as recent years indicate we have a history of investing more than 100 of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make in the current environment assuming current pricing expectations our 2017 exploration and development capital budget is expected to be approximately 20 billion to 23 billion 

at the end of 2016 we held approximately 20 billion of cash included in this total was 644 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries we would recognize and pay current income taxes in accordance with current us tax law the payment of such additional income tax would decrease the amount of cash ultimately available to fund our business

credit availability

we have a 30 billion senior credit facility the maturity date for 30 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2017 the maturity date for 164 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2018 the maturity date for the remaining 28 billion is october 24 2019 this credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2016 there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program see note 14 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling and goodwill impairments as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2016 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 187

 

index to financial statements 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness

debt ratings

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities in february 2016 our credit rating was revised by standard  poor’s financial services from bbb with a negative outlook to bbb with a stable outlook and moody’s investor service revised our senior unsecured rating from baa1 with a stable outlook to ba2 with negative outlook in march 2016 fitch ratings affirmed our bbb rating but revised our outlook from stable to negative further in july 2016 moody’s revised the outlook to stable the downgrade in ratings required us to post letters of credit and cash collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain contractual arrangements any further rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our or enlink’s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level however these downgrades could adversely impact our and enlink’s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future

capital expenditures

excluding enlink our 2017 capital expenditures are expected to range from 23 billion to 27 billion including 20 billion to 23 billion for our exploration and development capital program to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2017 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2017 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2017 available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2017 capital expenditures

enlink liquidity

enlink has a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the general partner has a 250 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016 there were 12 million in outstanding letters of credit and 120 million borrowed under the 15 billion credit facility and 28 million outstanding borrowings under the 250 million credit facility all of enlink’s and the general partner’s debt is nonrecourse to devon

 

index to financial statements 

enlink’s 2017 capital budget includes approximately 610 million to 770 million of identified growth projects enlink’s primary capital projects for 2017 include construction of the lobo ii plant and gathering system in the delaware basin completing construction of an ngl pipeline in louisiana and development of its tall oak assets 

enlink expects to fund the growth capital expenditures from the proceeds of borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from other debt and equity sources enlink expects to fund its 2017 maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows enlink employs a strategy that includes maintaining stable operating cash flows that are supported by longterm fixedfee contracts approximately 97 of enlink’s cash flows were generated from feebased services in 2016 in 2017 it is possible that not all of the planned projects will be commenced or completed enlink’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond its control

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by thirdparty petroleum consulting firms in 2016 89 of our reserves were subjected to such audits

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 5 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such 

 

index to financial statements 

rules also dictate that a 10 discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it generally is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition because of the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown

based on prices from the last nine months of 2016 and the shortterm pricing outlook for the first quarter of 2017 we do not expect to recognize us and canadian full cost impairments in the first quarter of 2017 

derivative financial instruments

we enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production to hedge future prices received additionally enlink periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to its oil gas and ngl marketing activity these commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex wti forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using us treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest rate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility

we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates under the terms of our foreign exchange forward contracts we generally receive us dollars and pay canadian dollars based on a total notional amount we estimate the fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward exchange rates the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our observation of forward foreign exchange rates the resulting future cash inflows or outflows at maturity of the contracts are discounted using treasury rates these discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties 

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our oil gas and ngl commodity derivative contracts are held with thirteen separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report

business combinations

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies a historical 12month average price to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance

 

index to financial statements 

in addition our acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations included substantial midstream activities in these transactions the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of midstream facilities and equipment generally consisting of processing facilities and pipeline systems estimating the fair value of these assets requires certain assumptions to be made regarding future quantities of commodities estimated to be processed and transported through these facilities and pipelines as well as estimates of future expected prices and operating and capital costs 

goodwill

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable while we use data as of october 31 for our test we typically complete the test in late december or early january as the october 31 market data used in our test becomes available we first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test is performed

in the first step of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses including comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment in the second step the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations operating margins and capital expenditures

for the october 31 2016 impairment tests for devon’s us reporting unit and each of enlink’s reporting units step one of the impairment analyses showed that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value

sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices together with a decline in the enlink unit price caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test for enlink’s reporting units in the first quarter of 2016 using the fair value approaches described above in the first quarter of 2016 it was determined that the estimated fair value of enlink’s texas general partner and crude and condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts primarily due to changes in assumptions related to commodity prices and discount rates through the analysis a goodwill impairment loss of 473 million 307 million and 93 million for enlink’s texas general partner and crude and condensate reporting units respectively was recognized in the first quarter of 2016

as of march 31 2016 the goodwill allocated to the crude and condensate reporting unit was fully impaired other than those mentioned above no other goodwill impairment was identified or recorded for the remaining reporting units as a result of the interim goodwill assessment as their estimated fair values were in excess of carrying values however the fair value of enlink’s texas and general partner reporting units are not substantially in excess of their carrying value the fair value of the texas and general partner reporting units approximates their carrying values after considering the impairment loss above and as of december 31 2016 233 million and 11 billion of goodwill remains allocated to the reporting units respectively

our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments as discussed above differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations if actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges which would be 

 

index to financial statements 

recognized in the period in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value we would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future operating results which could result in future goodwill impairments for other reporting units due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations 

the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized

other intangible assets

in 2015 the assessment of customer relationships was updated due to the factors described in the aforementioned goodwill section this assessment resulted in a 223 million impairment of other intangible assets related to enlink’s crude and condensate reporting unit level 3 fair value measurements were utilized for the impairment analysis of definitelived intangible assets which included discounted cash flow estimates consistent with those utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment

the other intangible assets impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized

income taxes

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at the end of 2016 and 2015 we had deferred tax assets that largely resulted from the full cost impairments recognized throughout 2015 and 2016 as a result of our recent cumulative losses and our current realization assessment we recorded a 100 valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 further in 2016 we recorded a 69 million valuation allowance against certain canadian deferred tax assets as a result of continued financial losses 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing us income tax laws particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and repatriations of foreign earnings changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities





 

index to financial statements 





because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impractical to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies

nongaap measures

we make reference to “core earnings attributable to devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2016 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures core earnings attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure items may appear to be recurring when comparing on an annual basis in the table below restructuring and transaction costs were incurred in each of the three year periods however these costs relate to different restructuring programs amounts excluded for 2016 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes noncash asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill deferred tax asset valuation allowance gains and losses on asset sales costs associated with early retirement of debt and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 workforce reduction 

amounts excluded for 2015 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill deferred tax asset valuation allowance restructuring and transaction costs and repatriation of funds to the us 

amounts excluded for 2014 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill gains and losses on asset sales costs associated with early retirement of debt restructuring and transaction costs associated with our 2014 divestiture program repatriation of proceeds to the us and deferred income tax on the formation of the general partner for more information on our restructuring programs see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts which typically make similar adjustments in their estimates of our financial results we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers

 item 7a quantitative and qual itative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading

commodity price risk

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2016 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2016 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net liability positions by the following amounts

 



 

interest rate risk

at december 31 2016 we had total debt of 102 billion of this amount 100 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 53 and approximately 150 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 25

as of december 31 2016 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the three month libor rate a 10 change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet or liquidity at december 31 2016

foreign currency risk

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2016 balance sheet

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however some of our subsidiaries hold canadiandollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are based in canadian dollars the value of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the us dollar functional currency based on the amount of the cash and

intercompany loans as of december 31 2016 a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

general 

devon is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration development and production of oil natural gas and ngls our operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the us and canada our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable environmentally responsible production and a platform for future growth we have doubled our onshore north american oil production since 2010 to more than 275 mbbls per day and have a deep inventory of development opportunities devon also produces over 16 bcf of natural gas a day and more than 136 mbbls of ngls per day 

additionally we control enlink a leading integrated midstream business with significant size and scale in key operating regions in the us this mlp focuses on providing gathering transmission processing fractionation and marketing to producers of natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate 

a delaware corporation formed in 1971 we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the nyse our principal and administrative offices are located at 333 west sheridan oklahoma city ok 731025015 telephone 4052353611 as of december 31 2015 devon and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 6600 employees approximately 1400 of such employees are employed by enlink through its subsidiaries 

devon files or furnishes annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k as well as any amendments to these reports with the sec through our website httpwwwdevonenergycom we make available electronic copies of the documents we file or furnish to the sec the charters of the committees of our board of directors and other documents related to our corporate governance including our code of ethics for the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the sec printed copies of our committee charters or other governance documents and filings can be requested by writing to our corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this report

strategy 

our primary goal is to build value per debtadjusted share by 

 

  

  

  

  

 during 2015 we continued to execute on this strategy and experienced a number of key achievements that are outlined in this report however we and the entire upstream energy sector have faced both operational and financial challenges as oil and natural gas prices weakened significantly throughout 2015 and continued into 2016 to navigate these turbulent times we are using our focused strategy flexible portfolio of assets and leadership experience to execute on a number of initiatives that will ensure our longterm financial strength 

  

specifically after completing the stack acquisition discussed in this report we had approximately 39 billion of liquidity 

while we will continue to operate and develop our premier portfolio of assets we are committed to protecting our balance sheet and managing our capital programs to be within our cash inflows including access pipeline proceeds as a result we are significantly reducing our capital investment in response to lower commodity prices we plan to invest 900 million to 11 billion in our upstream programs a decrease of roughly 75 compared to our 2015 capital we are also committed to reducing our ga and fieldlevel operating costs commensurate with our reduced but focused activity level following a number of costreduction initiatives culminating with our february 2016 workforce reduction we are expecting a 700 million to 900 million reduction in operating and ga costs on an annualized basis 

also in february 2016 we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend 75 to 006 per share 

  

oil and gas properties 

property profiles 

the locations of our core oil and gas properties are presented on the following map additional information related to these properties follows this map as well as information describing enlink’s assets 

 

 

  

the following table outlines a summary of key data in each of our operating areas as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 notes 20 and 21 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

 delaware basin  – the delaware basin has been a legacy asset for devon and continues to offer exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring delaware wolfcamp and leonard formations these oil and liquidsrich opportunities across our acreage in the delaware basin will offer highmargin growth potential for many years to come in 2016 we plan to invest approximately 200 million of capital in the delaware basin primarily focused on the second bone spring opportunity in the basin of southeast new mexico 

stack  – in early january 2016 we increased our acreage in the woodford shale and meramec plays by acquiring 80000 net acres in the stack the stack development located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian kingfisher and blaine counties is named for the stacked pay in the area our woodford shale position is the largest and one of the best in the industry recent wellcompletion design enhancements have resulted in greater productivity and improved economics early drilling activity in the meramec play has been encouraging across our core position in the oil and liquids window in 2016 we plan approximately 325 million of capital investment 

eagle ford  – we acquired our position in the eagle ford in early 2014 from geosouthern and have approximately 66000 net acres located in the dewitt and lavaca counties in south texas since acquiring these assets we have delivered tremendous results increasing production by 125 our excellent results are driven by our development in dewitt county which is located in the economic core of the play in 2016 we expect our eagle ford assets to once again deliver the highest operating margin of any asset in the portfolio and plan approximately 200 million of capital investment 

rockies oil – our operations are focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin and the wind river basin in the powder river we are currently targeting several cretaceous oil objectives including the turner parkman and frontier formations recent drilling success in these formations has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity in december 2015 we acquired 253000 net acres in the “core” of the oil fairway in the powder river this acquisition delivers some of the best returns in our portfolio and is a significant resource opportunity in 2016 we plan approximately 75 million of capital investment 

heavy oil  – our operations in canada are focused on our heavy oil assets in alberta canada our most significant canadian operation is our jackfish complex a thermal heavy oil operation in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we employ a recovery method known as steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish in 2014 we brought the third phase of jackfish into operation which ramped up to facility capacity by 

  

the third quarter of 2015 we expect each phase to maintain a reasonably flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average gross production rate of approximately 35 mbbls per day at each facility 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2015 with our 50 partner we are evaluating our development timeline for pike 

to facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production we have a 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale the access pipeline system has the capacity to transport approximately 170 mbbls of bitumen blend per day net to our 50 interest as discussed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report we have plans to monetize our interest in access pipeline in 2016 with any buyer of access pipeline we will also enter into a contractual arrangement to continue transporting our heavy oil volumes on access pipeline 

in addition to jackfish and pike we hold acreage and own producing assets in the bonnyville region located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta bonnyville is a lowrisk high margin oil development play that produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection 

in 2016 we plan approximately 175 million of capital investment in our canadian heavy oil business 

barnett shale  – this is our largest property in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to optimize production operations and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in north america given the commodity price environment in 2015 we shifted focus to enhancing existing well performance through refracturing artificial lift and line pressure reduction projects in 2015 we accelerated our horizontal refrac program to test the restimulation of 25 wells and also had an active vertical refrac program restimulating 140 vertical wells in 2016 we plan on minimal refrac activity in the barnett 

other – other assets are located primarily in the midland basin east texas granite wash and mississippianlime areas substantially all of these properties have been identified for divestiture in 2016 

proved reserves 

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property see note 21 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

since the beginning of 2015 no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency except in filings with the sec and the doe reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained in this report reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included in this report however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

  

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates including any or all of the following 

 

  

  

  

 the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past fifteen years including the past eight in his current position during his career he has been responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team in this role he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to the mobile bay norphlet discoveries gulf of mexico shelf cascade lower tertiary development gulf of mexico deepwater and polvo development campos basin brazil 

the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions and currently is in our chief financial officer’s organization no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

throughout the year the group performs internal reserves audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty petroleum consulting firms during 2015 we engaged two such firms to audit 95 of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited 94 of our 2015 us reserves and deloitte llp audited 96 of our canadian reserves 

  

“audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

in addition to conducting these internal and external audits we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with our thirdparty petroleum consultants the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 the following table presents our estimated pretax cash flow information related to our proved reserves these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

  

 pretax future net revenue and pretax 10 present value are nongaap measures the standardized measure was 67 billion at the end of 2015 included as part of the standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of 03 billion excluding these taxes the pretax 10 present value was 70 billion we believe the pretax 10 present value is a useful measure in addition to the aftertax standardized 

  

measure the pretax 10 present value assists in both the estimation of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies the aftertax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company while the pretax 10 present value is based on prices and discount factors which are more consistent from company to company 

production production prices and production costs 

the following table presents production price and cost information for each significant field country and continent 

 

  

  

   

drilling statistics 

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results 

 

  

 the following table presents the wells that were in progress on december 31 2015 as of february 1 2016 these wells were still in progress 

 

  

  productive wells 

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2015 

 

  

      

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 19000 wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of ga which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2015 of our 55 million net acres approximately 30 million acres are held by production the acreage in the table includes 02 million 04 million and 01 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively as of december 31 2015 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with our expiring acreage of the 07 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2018 we will perform operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2015 we allowed approximately 08 million acres to expire 

 

  

  title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

enlink properties 

enlink’s assets are comprised of systems and other assets located in four primary regions 

 

  

  

   

  

 marketing and midstream activities 

midstream operations 

comprising approximately 98 of our 2015 midstream operating profit enlink is the primary component of our midstream operations enlink’s operations primarily focus on providing midstream energy services which consist of gathering transmission processing fractionation and marketing to producers of natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate including devon enlink connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems processes natural gas for the removal of ngls fractionates ngls into purity products and markets those products for a fee transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets furthermore enlink purchases natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities industrial consumers other marketers and pipelines 

oil gas and ngl marketing 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2016 our production was sold under the following contract terms 

 

 delivery commitments 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2015 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production 

 

   

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves in certain regions such as in our heavy oil operation in canada we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves 

generally our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we may be subject to deficiency payments in such instances we can and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments 

customers 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our consolidated operating revenues

see “item 1a risk factors” 

public policy and government regulation 

our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation 

our operations are subject to federal tribal state provincial and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding venting and flaring and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of canadian oil and gas production crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production net of allowed deductions the royalty percentage is determined on a slidingscale based on crown posted prices the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered recently the province of alberta released the findings of the royalty review advisory panel which concluded that the royalties for oil sands were appropriate and should be maintained in the new royalty system to be implemented in 2017 

marketing in canada 

any oil or gas export that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

environmental and occupational regulations 

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities administrative civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

our business and operations and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks the risks described below may not be the only risks we face as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial if any of the following risks should occur our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

our financial results and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities since the second half of 2014 there has been a significant decline in oil gas and ngl prices which has adversely affected our 2015 operating results and contributed to a reduction in our anticipated future capital expenditures in addition this decline in commodity prices has adversely impacted our estimated proved reserves and resulted in substantial impairments to our oil and gas properties during 2015 a sustained weakness or further deterioration in commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in or exacerbating the following effects 

 

  

  

  

  

 historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions including commodity price declines and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities such as identifying additional producing zones in existing wells utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

our exploration and development activities are subject to numerous costs and risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs drilling for oil gas and ngls can be unprofitable not only from dry holes but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs substantial costs are required to locate acquire and develop oil and gas properties and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs our cost of drilling completing equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in addition our oil and gas properties can become damaged our drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property and certain of these events particularly equipment failures or accidents could impact third parties including persons living in proximity to our operations our employees and employees of our contractors leading to possible injuries death or significant property damage 

hedging limits participation in commodity price increases 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts 

the credit risk of our counterparties could adversely affect us 

we enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk for example we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements our syndicated revolving credit facility and our insurance policies disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us 

in addition we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade joint interest billing and other receivables we sell our oil gas and ngls to a variety of purchasers and as an operator we pay expenses and bill our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of costs we also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells certain of these counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us particularly if commodity prices remain depressed or decline further any such default by these counterparties could adversely impact our financial results 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which can change and could adversely impact our business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state provincial tribal local and other laws rules and regulations including with respect to environmental health and safety wildlife conservation gathering and transportation of oil gas and ngls conservation policies reporting obligations royalty payments unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations if permits are not issued or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned in addition we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental rules regulations permits or orders for example certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by current and former operators which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations 

in addition changes in public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations regulatory developments could among other things restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing seismic activity income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

  

hydraulic fracturing – the us environmental protection agency “epa” and other federal agencies including the bureau of land management “blm” have made proposals that if implemented could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation for example the epa has also issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and proposed in april 2015 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the blm and many states have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws andor regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations in addition some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays in development or restrictions on our operations 

pipeline safety – the pipeline assets in which we own interests are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management the department of transportation through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas ngl and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids such as oil that in the event of a failure could affect “high consequence areas” additional action by phmsa with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future at this time we cannot predict the cost of such requirements but they could be significant moreover violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties 

seismic activity – recent earthquakes in northcentral oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry specifically disposal wells used to inject into the subsurface water that is produced along with oil and natural gas legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation that could limit or eliminate our ability to inject produced water into certain disposal wells restrictions on such disposal wells could lead to operational delays increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations in addition we could be subject to thirdparty lawsuits seeking alleged property damages as a result of induced seismic activity in our areas of operation 

income taxes – we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow the us president and other policy makers have proposed provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws applicable to us one significant proposal that has recently been considered at the federal level would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs the adoption of this proposal or other tax changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

climate change – policy makers in the us and canada are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policy makers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor taxes on greenhouse gas emissions for example both the epa and the blm have proposed regulations for the control of methane emissions which also include leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas industry legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an 

  

economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from use of our products by our customers although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations severe limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas which could have a material adverse effect our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

currently the alberta government is developing a new strategy on climate change based on recommendations put forward by the climate change advisory panel it is expected that these recommendations will create additional costs for the canadian oil and gas industry presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any law or regulations developed 

our debt may limit our liquidity and financial flexibility and any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely impact us 

as of december 31 2015 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 131 billion our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 in addition we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the us with respect to our debt factors that may impact our credit ratings include among others debt levels planned assets sales and purchases liquidity forecasted production growth and commodity prices a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any other future debt a ratings downgrade to a rating below investmentgrade made by one or more rating agencies could potentially require us to post collateral under certain contractual arrangements 

environmental matters and related costs can be significant 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations environmental laws may impose strict joint and several liability and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative civil or criminal fines and penalties as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks 

our business depends in part on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses if we are unable to make attractive acquisitions then our future growth could be limited furthermore even if we do make acquisitions they may not result in an 

  

increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 in addition from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity these transactions also have inherent risks including possible delays in closing the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the disposed assets and potential postclosing claims for indemnification moreover the current commodity price environment may result in fewer potential bidders unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing in addition we may not realize any expected cost savings from asset dispositions in part because of revenue losses from the divested properties 

insurance does not cover all risks 

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to people or loss of life additionally for our nonoperated properties we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk war and terrorism our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

limited control on properties operated by others 

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our oil natural gas and ngl production to downstream markets such midstream systems include enlink’s systems as 

  

well as other systems operated by us or third parties regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time from losing access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions and natural disasters accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and third parties may be subject to constraints that limit our or their ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

competition for assets materials people and capital can be significant 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

cyber attacks targeting our systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct daily operations concurrently the industry has become the subject of increased levels of cyberattack activity cyber attacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption and may be carried out by third parties or insiders the techniques utilized range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date if we were successfully attacked we might incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences moreover as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview of 2015 results 

by executing on our strategy outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis during 2015 we had several key operating and financial achievements 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

as a result of these large commodity price declines and in spite of our operating achievements we recognized 21 billion of noncash asset impairments throughout 2015 that have negatively impacted our financial earnings and retained earnings additionally our core earnings core earnings per share and operating cash flow for 2015 decreased significantly compared to 2014 key measures of our financial performance in 2015 are summarized in the following table 

 

  

   business and industry outlook 

market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile therefore we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell however current market fundamentals indicate prices for crude oil and natural gas will continue to be depressed for much of 2016 although changes in opec production strategies macroeconomic forecasts geopolitical risks or other factors could impact current forecasts we anticipate weak oil and natural gas prices throughout the majority of 2016 

in 2015 devon marked its 44th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 27th year as a public company as an established company with a strong leadership team we have experience operating in periods of weak commodity prices with our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets we are prepared to successfully navigate the current pricing challenges and ensure our longterm financial strength 

specifically after completing the stack acquisition we began 2016 with approximately 39 billion of liquidity consisting of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility we expect to bolster this liquidity in 2016 by monetizing our interest in access pipeline and other noncore upstream assets for targeted total proceeds of 2 billion to 3 billion 

while we will continue to operate and develop our premier portfolio of assets we are committed to protecting our balance sheet and managing our capital programs to be within our cash inflows including access pipeline proceeds as a result we are significantly reducing our capital investment in response to lower commodity prices we plan to invest 900 million to 11 billion in our upstream programs a decrease of roughly 75 compared to our 2015 capital 

we are also committed to reducing our ga and fieldlevel operating costs commensurate with our reduced but focused activity level in the first quarter of 2016 we announced plans to significantly reduce our 

  

workforce and other ga costs to better align with the activity level of our core business in the current commodity price environment the reductions are expected to decrease gross ga costs by approximately 400 million to 500 million on an annualized basis excluding associated employee severance and other restructuring costs following a number of costreduction initiatives culminating with our february 2016 workforce reduction we are expecting a 700 million to 900 million reduction in operating and ga costs on an annualized basis 

we estimate we will incur approximately 225 million to 275 million of restructuring costs as a result of the workforce reduction we expect to recognize the majority of these restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2016 and will recognize the remaining costs throughout 2016 until our planned divestiture transactions have closed and further workforce reductions occur 

also in february 2016 we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend 75 to 006 per share 

  

results of operations 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

  

   

oil gas and ngl pricing 

 

  

  commodity sales 

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales 

 

 volumes 2015 vs 2014 oil gas and ngl sales increased due to volumes in 2015 because of strong production growth from our us oil properties the growth was primarily driven by the continued development of our eagle ford delaware basin and rockies oil properties additionally our bitumen production increased primarily due to jackfish 3 coming online late in the third quarter of 2014 and reaching nameplate capacity in the third quarter of 2015 lower royalties resulting from the significant price decrease also increased our heavy 

  

oil production the increases were partially offset by a decrease in our gas production which resulted primarily from asset divestitures in 2014 and natural reservoir declines 

volumes 2014 vs 2013 oil gas and ngl sales increased due to volumes primarily because of a 66 increase in our core assets oil production such growth resulted from our eagle ford properties and the continued development of our properties in the delaware basin in addition we continued to grow our ngl production from the delaware basin and stack which resulted in 131 million of additional sales bitumen sales increased due to development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada including jackfish 3 which had first sales in 2014 these increases were partially offset by a 20 decrease in our 2014 gas production which was impacted by our asset divestitures and natural declines 

prices 2015 vs 2014 oil gas and ngl sales decreased in 2015 as a result of significantly lower prices for all commodities the decrease in oil and bitumen sales primarily resulted from significantly lower average wti crude oil index prices which were approximately 50 lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 the decreases in gas and ngl sales were driven by lower north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

prices 2014 vs 2013 oil gas and ngl sales increased primarily because of a 20 increase in our realized prices without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted the change in our realized gas price was largely due to higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based additionally our bitumen sales increased as a result of a 16 increase in our realized price as a result of tighter bitumen and heavy oil differentials these increases were partially offset by lower oil and ngl realized prices resulting from lower wti crude oil index prices and lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses 

 

   

  

  

 cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments a summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars basis swaps and call options to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we sold gas and oil call options for 2015 through 2016 the call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives generated net gains in 2015 and 2014 and incurred a net loss in 2013 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating expenses 

 

   

2015 vs 2014 marketing and midstream operating profit changes were largely driven by a full year of enlink’s legacy asset operations compared to prior year and facility expansions coming online in late 2014 along with assets acquired during 2015 the change was offset by a decrease in devon’s marketing activities due to a decrease in commodity prices 

2014 vs 2013 marketing and midstream operating profit largely increased as a result of higher prices and volumes partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of the 339 million increase 344 million was attributed to enlink’s operations higher profits from enlink’s texas segment which includes the bridgeport facility and louisiana segment were the largest drivers of the increase the louisiana segment operating profit increased because of acquisitions and completions of additional pipelines 

devon’s marketing activities were the primary driver of the increases in both operating revenues and product purchases the higher marketing revenues and product purchases are primarily due to commitments we entered into to secure capacity on downstream oil pipelines marketing activities of enlink also contributed to these increases 

lease operating expenses 

 

 2015 vs 2014 loe per boe decreased during 2015 primarily as a result of higher jackfish 3 volumes our well optimization and cost reduction initiatives lower royalties and changes in the canadian to us foreign exchange rate as canadian royalties decrease our net production volumes increase causing improvements to our perunit operating costs the flat us rate is primarily related to our 2014 noncore natural gas asset divestitures and our oil production growth where projects generate higher margins but generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our retained and divested gas projects 

2014 vs 2013 our absolute loe changed largely as a result of our portfolio transformation initiatives including our february 2014 purchase of eagle ford assets and our 2014 divestitures of noncore gas properties in the us and canada higher volumes from development of our eagle ford assets as well as our delaware basin assets caused us loe to increase this increase was partially offset by the decrease resulting from the us divestitures the canadian divestitures were the primary cause of the decrease in canadian loe 

total loe increased 052 per boe primarily because of higher unit costs related to our canadian operations the higher canadian unit costs largely resulted from the divestiture of the conventional natural gas assets in the second quarter of 2014 which resulted in lower total volumes while retaining the relatively highercost thermal heavy oil operations additionally higher jackfish royalties paid in 2014 also contributed to higher canadian unit costs the higher unit cost in the us was primarily related to our liquids production growth particularly in the delaware basin and mississippianwoodford trend where projects generate higher revenues but generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects additionally we experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which also contributed to the higher loe per boe 

  

general and administrative expenses 

 

 2015 vs 2014 gross ga decreased during 2015 largely because of a lower employee performance bonus pool and our cost reduction initiatives furthermore 22 million in onetime costs related to the enlink and geosouthern transactions contributed to higher costs in the first quarter of 2014 these decreases were offset by an increase in enlink ga of approximately 40 million primarily resulting from a workforce increase associated with enlink’s 2015 acquisitions reimbursed ga decreased subsequent to our 2014 asset divestitures 

2014 vs 2013 net ga and net ga per boe increased largely due to higher employee compensation and benefits and 22 million of 2014 costs related to the enlink and geosouthern transactions the higher employee compensation and benefits costs were primarily related to sharebased awards which cause our ga to be higher in the period in which our annual sharebased grant is made the grant related to our 2013 compensation cycle was made in the first quarter of 2014 the grant related to our 2012 compensation cycle was made in the fourth quarter of 2012 additionally the expansion of our workforce as a part of growing production operations at certain of our key areas also contributed to the increase 

production and property taxes 

 

 2015 vs 2014 our absolute production taxes decreased during 2015 primarily because of a decrease in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed property taxes as a percentage of oil gas and ngl sales increased during 2015 primarily due to ad valorem and other taxes that do not change in direct correlation with oil gas and ngl sales 

2014 vs 2013 production and property taxes increased primarily as a result of an increase in our us revenues 

  

depreciation depletion and amortization 

 

 a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 

2015 vs 2014 dda from our oil and gas properties decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 largely because of the 2014 divestitures of certain us and canadian assets and the oil and gas asset impairments recognized in 2015 other dda increased primarily due to enlink’s acquisitions in 2014 and 2015 

2014 vs 2013 dda from our oil and gas properties increased in 2014 largely because of higher dda rates the higher rates resulted from our oil and gas drilling and development activities and the geosouthern acquisition which were partially offset by the asset impairments recognized in 2013 and the 2014 asset divestitures other dda increased primarily due to the formation of enlink in 2014 

asset impairments 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized asset impairments of 208 billion 20 billion and 20 billion respectively for discussion on asset impairments see note 5 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

restructuring costs 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized restructuring costs of 78 million 46 million and 54 million respectively for discussion of our reorganization programs and the associated restructuring costs see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

gains on asset sales 

in conjunction with the divestiture of certain canadian properties we recognized gains of 11 billion in 2014 for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

  

net financing costs 

 

 2015 vs 2014 net financing costs decreased during 2015 primarily as a result of the retirement premium and costs related to the early redemption of senior notes in 2014 which is further discussed in note 13 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report interest on outstanding borrowings increased during 2015 primarily due to an increase of 51 million in enlink interest expense as a result of an increase in fixedrate borrowings partially offset by a 18 million decrease in devon interest expense as a result of a decrease in its average fixedrate borrowings 

2014 vs 2013 net financing costs increased primarily because of higher average borrowings resulting from the enlink and geosouthern transactions and the 2014 early retirement premium and costs 

income taxes 

 

 for discussion on income taxes see note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

  

capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

  

 operating cash flow 

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2015 our operating cash flow decreased 10 during 2015 primarily due to lower commodity prices the effects of lower commodity prices were partially offset by the collection of 425 million of income taxes receivable in the first quarter of 2015 and 24 billion of cash settlements associated with our commodity derivatives during 2015 

our operating cash flow increased 10 during 2014 primarily because of higher realized prices and liquids production growth partially offset by higher expenses 

excluding payments made for acquisitions our consolidated operating cash flow funded 100 and approximately 86 of our capital expenditures during 2015 and 2014 respectively in 2015 and 2014 leveraging our liquidity and other capital resources we also used cash balances shortterm debt proceeds from enlink transactions and divestiture proceeds to fund our acquisitions dividends and capital requirements 

sale of subsidiary units 

in early 2015 we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of 262 million common units representing limited partner interests in enlink raising proceeds of 654 million net of underwriting discount see note 17 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

  

divestitures of property and equipment 

during 2014 we completed our canadian asset divestiture program and received proceeds of approximately 29 billion additionally we completed the divestment of certain of our us assets and received proceeds of approximately 22 billion 

during 2013 we sold our thunder creek operations in wyoming for approximately 148 million and our bear paw basin assets in havre montana for approximately 73 million we also sold other minor oil and gas assets 

capital expenditures 

 

 capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations other corporate activities and enlink growth and maintenance activities 

the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties in response to lower commodity prices devon’s 2015 capital program was designed to be lower than 2014 particularly compared to the second half of 2014 when oil prices began to significantly decline this change is evidenced by a 48 decrease in exploration and development costs from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as a 24 decrease in total capital expenditures from 2014 to 2015 excluding acquisitions excluding acquisitions oil and gas capital spending was flat from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to utilization of the drilling carries in 2014 from our joint venture arrangements 

capital expenditures for devon’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines and are largely impacted by devon’s oil and gas drilling activities our 2014 and 2013 midstream capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of our access pipeline in canada the majority of our midstream capital is incurred by enlink enlink’s 2015 capital expenditures decreased compared to 2014 primarily as a result of pipeline construction and expansion projects that went into service in 2014 enlink’s 2013 capital expenditures primarily related to expansions of plants serving the barnett shale and canawoodford shale 

acquisition capital spend in 2015 primarily consisted of the powder river basin asset acquisition in the fourth quarter the majority of the acquisition capital in 2014 related to the geosouthern acquisition in the eagle ford enlink’s acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 consisted of additional oil and gas pipeline assets including gathering transportation and processing facilities for further discussion on enlink acquisition activity see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

  

shortterm investment activity net 

during 2013 we purchased approximately 11 billion of shortterm investments and redeemed approximately 34 billion we consider securities with original contract maturities in excess of three months but less than one year to be shortterm investments 

debt activity net 

during 2015 our consolidated net debt borrowings increased 18 billion in june 2015 we issued 750 million of 50 senior notes we used these proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes upon maturity on december 15 2015 as well as outstanding commercial paper balances in december 2015 we issued 850 million of 585 senior notes to fund acquisitions announced in the fourth quarter enlink’s net debt borrowings increased 11 billion primarily from borrowings made to fund acquisitions and dropdowns 

during 2014 we decreased our net debt borrowings by 22 billion the decrease was primarily related to the repayment of debt used to fund the geosouthern transaction this was partially offset by 555 million of net borrowings from enlink to fund its operations 

during 2013 we increased our debt borrowings by 361 million as a result of issuing 225 billion of debt related to the planned eagle ford acquisition and repaying approximately 19 billion of outstanding shortterm debt 

shareholder and noncontrolling interests distributions 

the following table summarizes our common stock dividends the quarterly cash dividend was 020 per share in the first quarter of 2013 we increased the dividend rate to 022 per share in the second quarter of 2013 and to 024 per share in the second quarter of 2014 

 

 in conjunction with the formation of enlink in the first quarter of 2014 we made a payment of 100 million to noncontrolling interests furthermore enlink and the general partner distributed 254 and 135 million to nondevon unitholders during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

enlink and general partner distributions 

devon received 268 million and 158 million in distributions from enlink and the general partner during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

enlink dropdowns 

in the second quarter of 2015 devon received 167 million in cash from enlink in exchange for vex for further discussion see note 2 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

stock option proceeds 

we received 4 million 93 million and 3 million from stock option proceeds in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

issuance of subsidiary units 

during 2015 and 2014 enlink issued and sold approximately 13 million and 148 million common units through general public offerings and its “at the market” equity program generating net proceeds of approximately 25 million and 410 million respectively furthermore in october 2015 enlink issued approximately 28 million common units in a private placement transaction with the general partner generating approximately 50 million in proceeds 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances other available sources of capital and liquidity include among other things debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec as well as the sale of a portion of our common units representing interests in our investment in enlink and the general partner we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section 

operating cash flow 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil bitumen gas and ngls we produce and sell our consolidated operating cash flow decreased 10 in 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices in spite of this decline we expect operating cash flow to continue to be a primary source of liquidity as we adjust our capital program in response to lower commodity prices additionally we anticipate utilizing divestiture proceeds and our credit availability to provide additional liquidity as needed 

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control we expect lower prices to continue throughout 2016 and currently our production is largely unhedged if commodity prices remain consistent with 2015 and we are unable to obtain favorable hedge contracts for our 2016 production our 2016 operating cash flow could materially decline from what it was in 2015 

the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2015 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also decrease causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline however the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices 

divestitures of property and equipment – in the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced our intention to monetize up to 80 mboe per day of certain noncore upstream assets across our portfolio in 2016 in addition we also intend to market our access pipeline in canada we anticipate these divestitures will generate approximately 2 billion to 3 billion of proceeds to further strengthen our financial position in 2016 

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2015 we had total debt of 131 billion with an overall weightedaverage borrowing rate of 49 of the 131 billion of total debt 14 billion is comprised of floating rate debt instruments that bear interest rates averaging 11 

  

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate additionally we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

as recent years indicate we have a history of investing more than 100 of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make in the current environment assuming current pricing expectations our 2016 exploration and development capital budget is expected to be approximately 900 million to 11 billion or roughly 75 less than our 2015 capital program with our 2016 capital focused primarily on oil development we anticipate our oil production will remain relatively flat from 2015 to 2016 but our natural gas and ngl production will decline resulting in a 6 production decline in our core assets 

at the end of 2015 we held approximately 23 billion of cash included in this total was 646 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries we would recognize and pay current income taxes in accordance with current us tax law the payment of such additional income tax would decrease the amount of cash ultimately available to fund our business 

credit availability 

we have a 30 billion senior credit facility the maturity date for 30 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2017 the maturity date for 164 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2018 the maturity date for the remaining 28 billion is october 24 2019 this credit facility supports our 30 billion commercial paper program amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2015 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling and goodwill impairments as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2015 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 237 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit 

  

agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

our senior credit facility supports our 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2015 we had 626 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

enlink has a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the general partner has a 250 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015 there were 11 million in outstanding letters of credit and 414 million borrowed under the 15 billion credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under the 250 million credit facility all of enlink’s and the general partner’s debt is nonrecourse to devon 

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material furthermore any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness 

debt ratings 

devon and enlink are rated by the major debt ratings agencies in the us however the general partner does not receive debt ratings in determining those debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales nearterm and longterm growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our or enlink’s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should debt ratings fall below a specified level however a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our and enlink’s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future 

capital expenditures 

in january 2016 devon acquired anadarko basin stack assets for approximately 15 billion in cash and equity subject to certain adjustments including this acquisition but excluding enlink our 2016 capital expenditures are expected to range from 12 billion to 14 billion including 900 million to 11 billion for our oil and gas capital program to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2016 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2016 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2016 available cash balances and credit availability and proceeds from our divestiture program we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2016 capital expenditures 

in connection with our acquisition of the stack play and powder river basin assets we issued 23470000 shares of our common stock the “stack acquisition shares” and 6857488 shares of our common stock the “prb acquisition shares” respectively pursuant to the terms of these acquisitions we agreed to register for resale with the sec the stack acquisition shares and the prb acquisition shares following such respective registrations the stack acquisition shares and the prb acquisition shares can generally be freely sold in the public markets at any time on or after february 21 2016 and march 16 2016 respectively 

  

enlink capital resources and expenditures 

in january 2016 enlink acquired tall oak a gathering and processing midstream company with assets in central oklahoma for approximately 15 billion in cash and equity subject to certain adjustments 

excluding this acquisition enlink’s 2016 capital budget includes approximately 445 million to 570 million of identified growth projects enlink’s primary capital projects for 2016 include completing the construction of the riptide plant in texas acquired as part of the coronado transaction commencing construction on an ngl pipeline in louisiana and development of its tall oak assets 

enlink expects to fund the growth capital expenditures from the proceeds of borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from other debt and equity sources enlink expects to fund its 2016 maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows in 2016 it is possible that not all of the planned projects will be commenced or completed enlink’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond its control 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 

 

  

      

  

  

     contingencies and legal matters 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 18 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by thirdparty petroleum consulting firms in 2015 95 of our reserves were subjected to such audits 

  

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 3 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such rules also dictate that a 10 discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it generally is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition because of the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

based on prices for the last nine months of 2015 and the shortterm pricing outlook for the first quarter of 2016 we expect to recognize additional us and canadian full cost impairments in the first quarter of 2016 the estimated us impairment would be material to our net earnings but we believe it will not be as large as the 37 billion impairment we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 we also expect to recognize an impairment related to our canadian oil and gas properties that will approximate the impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 while difficult to measure we estimate that the first quarter 2016 impairments will approximate 3 billion in the aggregate our full cost impairments have no impact to our cash flow or liquidity 

derivative financial instruments 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production to hedge future prices received additionally enlink periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to its oil gas and ngl marketing activity these commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex wti forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we 

  

base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using us treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest rate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility 

we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates under the terms of our foreign exchange forward contracts we generally receive us dollars and pay canadian dollars based on a total notional amount we estimate the fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward exchange rates the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our observation of forward foreign exchange rates the resulting future cash inflows or outflows at maturity of the contracts are discounted using treasury rates these discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties 

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our oil gas and ngl commodity derivative contracts are held with thirteen separate counterparties and our foreign exchange forward contracts are held with six separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

business combinations 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

  

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies a historical 12month average price to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance 

in addition our acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations included substantial midstream activities in these transactions the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of midstream facilities and equipment generally consisting of processing facilities and pipeline systems estimating the fair value of these assets requires certain assumptions to be made regarding future quantities of commodities estimated to be processed and transported through these facilities and pipelines as well as estimates of future expected prices and operating and capital costs 

goodwill 

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable while we use data as of october 31 for our test we typically complete the test in late december or early january as the october 31 market data used in our test becomes available we first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test is performed 

in the first step of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses including comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment 

  

test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment in the second step the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations operating margins and capital expenditures 

for our october 31 2015 impairment test step one of our impairment analysis showed that the fair value of our us reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

sustained weakness in the overall energy sector beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015 driven by low commodity prices together with a decline in the enlink unit price caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test for enlink’s reporting units as well as an update performed as of december 31 based on the results of the impairment analysis it was determined that the estimated fair value of enlink’s crude and condensate louisiana and texas reporting units were less than their carrying amounts primarily due to changes in assumptions related to commodity prices and discount rates through the analysis goodwill impairments of 492 million 787 million and 49 million for enlink’s texas louisiana and crude and condensate reporting units respectively were recognized in 2015 subsequent to the impairments enlink had 93 million and 704 million of goodwill allocated to the crude and condensate and texas reporting units respectively the louisiana reporting unit’s goodwill was entirely written off as of december 31 2015 the fair value of enlink’s texas reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 and the carrying value of enlink’s crude and condensate reporting unit approximated its fair value 

the impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized 

other intangible assets 

in 2015 the assessment of customer relationships was updated due to the factors described in the aforementioned goodwill section this assessment resulted in a 223 million impairment of other intangible assets related to enlink’s crude and condensate reporting unit level 3 fair value measurements were utilized for the impairment analysis of definitelived intangible assets which included discounted cash flow estimates consistent with those utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment 

the other intangible assets impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it adversely affects our results of operations in the period recognized 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at the end of 2015 we had deferred tax assets that largely resulted from the full cost impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our recent cumulative losses we recorded a 100 valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december 31 2015 

  

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters 

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing us income tax laws particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and repatriations of foreign earnings changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities 

 

  

  

  

 because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impractical to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies 

nongaap measures 

we make reference to “core earnings attributable to devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2015 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures core earnings attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure items may appear to be recurring when comparing on an annual basis in the table below restructuring costs were incurred in each of the three year periods however these costs relate to different restructuring programs amounts excluded for 2015 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill deferred tax asset valuation allowance restructuring costs and repatriation of funds to the us amounts excluded for 2014 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill our divestiture programs and related gains on asset sales and restructuring costs repatriation of proceeds to the us loss on early retirement of debt and deferred income tax on the formation of the general partner amounts excluded for 2013 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments our divestiture programs and related repatriation of proceeds to the us and restructuring costs for more information on our restructuring programs see note 6 in “item 8 financial 

  

statements and supplementary data” of this report we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers 

below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions the key terms to all our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2015 are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2015 a 10 change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would not have materially impacted our balance sheet at december 31 2015 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2015 we had total debt of 131 billion of this amount 117 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 53 and 14 billion is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 11 our commercial paper borrowings typically have maturities between 1 and 90 days 

as of december 31 2015 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 3 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the 3 month libor rate a 10 change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet at december 31 2015 

foreign currency risk 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our december 31 2015 balance sheet 

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however some of our subsidiaries hold canadiandollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are based in canadian dollars the value of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the us dollar functional currency additionally at december 31 2015 we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans the increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the us dollar equivalent of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans based on the amount of the cash and intercompany loans as of december 31 2015 a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

general 

devon energy corporation “devon” is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration development and production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls our operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the us and canada our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable environmentally responsible production and a platform for future growth we have doubled our onshore north american oil production since 2010 to more than 200000 barrels per day and have a deep inventory of development opportunities devon also produces over 16 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day and more than 130000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day 

additionally in 2014 we combined substantially all of our us midstream assets with crosstex energy inc and crosstex energy lp together “crosstex” to form a leading integrated midstream business with enhanced size and scale in key operating regions in the us this midstream business focuses on providing gathering transmission processing fractionation and marketing to producers of natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate 

a delaware corporation formed in 1971 we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 333 west sheridan oklahoma city ok 731025015 telephone 4052353611 as of december 31 2014 devon and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 6600 employees approximately 1100 of such employees are employed by enlink midstream partners lp “enlink” through its subsidiaries 

devon files or furnishes annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k as well as any amendments to these reports with the sec through our website httpwwwdevonenergycom we make available electronic copies of the documents we file or furnish to the sec the charters of the committees of our board of directors and other documents related to our corporate governance including our code of ethics for the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the sec printed copies of our committee charters or other governance documents and filings can be requested by writing to our corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this report 

in addition the public may read and copy any materials devon files with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 the public may also obtain information about the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 reports filed with the sec are also made available on its website at wwwsecgov 

strategy 

our primary goal is to build value per share in pursuit of this objective we focus on growing cash flow per share adjusted for debt which we believe has the greatest longterm correlation to share price appreciation in our industry we also focus on growth in earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we do this by 

 

  

  

  

   

in pursuit of our goal to build value per share we executed three strategic initiatives in 2014 

 

  

 in exchange for a controlling interest in both enlink and the general partner we contributed our equity interest in enlink midstream holdings lp a newly formed devon subsidiary “enlink holdings” and 100 million in cash enlink holdings owns midstream assets in the barnett shale in north texas and the cana and arkomawoodford shales in oklahoma as well as an economic interest in gulf coast fractionators in mont belvieu texas as of december 31 2014 the general partner and enlink each held 50 of enlink holdings 

 

 the initiatives above resulted in a more focused asset base allowing us to better allocate capital and employee resources to the highestvalue properties and prospects in our portfolio 

  

oil and gas properties 

property profiles 

the locations of our oil and gas properties are presented on the following map additional information related to these properties follows this map as well as information describing enlink’s assets 

 

  

the following table outlines a summary of key data in each of our operating areas for 2014 notes 21 and 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas in the following table and throughout this report we convert our proved reserves and production to boe gas proved reserves and production are converted at the pressure base standard of each respective state in which the gas is produced to boe at the rate of six mcf of gas per bbl of oil based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil bitumen and ngl proved reserves and production are converted to boe on a onetoone basis with oil 

 

 anadarko basin  – our acreage is located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian blaine and caddo counties the anadarko basin is a nonconventional reservoir and produces natural gas ngls and condensate 

the canawoodford play in the anadarko basin has emerged as one of the most economic shale plays in north america we are the largest leaseholder and the largest producer in this play during 2014 we increased our production by 21 percent we have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 95 gross wells in the anadarko basin 

barnett shale  – this is our largest property in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas the barnett shale is a nonconventional reservoir producing natural gas ngls and condensate 

since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to enhance production and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in north america in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 10 gross wells 

eagle ford  – we have approximately 82000 net acres located in the dewitt and lavaca counties in south texas the eagle ford is an industryleading lightoil play and is delivering some of the highest rateofreturn drilling opportunities in north america 

we acquired our position in the eagle ford on february 28 2014 from geosouthern and subsequently have produced approximately 24 mmboe with oil accounting for 61 percent of production from the play our acreage in dewitt county is derisked with at least one well drilled in each of the drilling units providing us with a significant development drilling inventory our development in lavaca county is less mature but we have had encouraging results from recently drilled wells in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 225 gross wells 

  

in addition we have a 100 percent interest in the victoria express pipeline “vex” in south texas the vex pipeline is a 56 mile crude oil pipeline from the eagle ford to the port of victoria terminal that has a current capacity of 50 mbopd 

mississippianwoodford trend – our leases are located in north central oklahoma targeting oil in the mississippian lime and woodford shale these areas are being explored and developed under an arrangement with our joint venture partner and independently by us on the acreage outside of our area of mutual interest with our joint venture partner in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 50 gross wells 

permian basin  – the permian basin has been a legacy asset for devon and continues to offer exploration and lowrisk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types including the oilrich bone spring wolfcamp shale delaware and various conventional formations these and other emerging oil and liquidsrich opportunities across our acreage in the permian basin will deliver highmargin growth for many years to come in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 240 gross wells 

rockies – our operations are focused on emerging oil opportunities in the powder river basin and the wind river basin in the powder river we are currently targeting several cretaceous oil objectives including the turner parkman and frontier formations recent drilling success in these formations has expanded our drilling inventory and we expect further growth as we continue to derisk this emerging lightoil opportunity in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 40 gross wells in the powder river basin 

canadian heavy oil  – we currently have two main projects jackfish and pike located in alberta canada in addition our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection 

jackfish is our thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we are employing steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish in 2014 we brought the third phase of jackfish into operation each phase has a gross facility capacity of 35 mbbls per day at each facility with three phases of jackfish operating production increased 8 percent in 2014 we expect each phase to maintain a reasonably flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average gross production rate of approximately 35 mbbls per day 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2014 the regulatory application we filed in 2012 for the first phase of this project was approved in 2014 for initial gross capacity of 105 mbbls per day we operate and hold a 50 percent interest in the pike project our planned activity at pike in 2015 consists of frontend engineering and design work as well as further understanding reservoir characteristics 

to facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production we have a 50 percent interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale in 2014 we completed a capacity expansion on the access pipeline system increasing the capacity to transport approximately 170000 barrels of bitumen blend per day net to our 50 interest this expansion is expected to create adequate capacity to transport our growing heavy oil production to the edmonton market hub additionally it will increase the transport capacity of condensate diluent available at our thermal oil facilities 

in addition to our jackfish and pike projects we hold acreage and own producing assets in the lloydminster region our lloydminster region is welldeveloped with significant infrastructure and is primarily accessible yearround for drilling lloydminster is a lowrisk high margin oil development play 

in 2015 we plan to drill approximately 130 gross wells in canada 

  

divested properties – during 2014 we monetized certain assets through an asset divestiture program see note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

proved reserves 

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property see note 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2014 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained in this report reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included in this report however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates including any or all of the following 

 

  

  

  

 the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past fourteen years including the past seven in his current position during his career he has been responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team in this role he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to the mobile bay norphlet discoveries gulf of mexico shelf cascade lower tertiary development gulf of mexico deepwater and polvo development campos basin brazil 

the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our vice president of budget and reserves who reports to our senior vice president of business development who reports to our chief financial officer no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2014 we engaged two such firms to audit 91 percent of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited 90 percent of our 2014 us reserves and deloitte llp audited 95 percent of our canadian reserves 

“audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with our independent petroleum consultants the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the following table presents our estimated pretax cash flow information related to proved reserves these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

  

 pretax future net revenue and pretax 10 percent present value are nongaap measures the present value of aftertax future net revenues discounted at 10 percent per annum “standardized measure” was 205 billion at the end of 2014 included as part of standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of 75 billion excluding these taxes the present value of our pretax future net revenue “pretax 10 percent present value” was 28 billion we believe the pretax 10 percent present value is a useful measure in addition to the aftertax standardized measure the pretax 10 percent present value assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies the aftertax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company while the pretax 10 percent present value is based on prices and discount factors which are more consistent from company to company 

  

production production prices and production costs 

the following table presents production price and cost information for each significant field country and continent 

 

  

   

drilling statistics 

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results 

 

  

 the following table presents the february 1 2015 results of our wells that were in progress on december 31 2014 

 

  

  productive wells 

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2014 

 

  

   the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs 

  

field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 19000 wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2014 the acreage in the table includes 09 million 03 million and 05 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as of december 31 2014 there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with our expiring acreage of the 17 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2017 we will perform operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to further assess however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2014 we allowed approximately 02 million acres to expire 

 

  

  title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

enlink properties 

enlink’s assets are comprised of systems and other assets located in four primary regions 

 

  

  

   

 marketing and midstream activities 

midstream operations 

comprising approximately 95 of our 2014 midstream operating profit enlink is the primary component of our midstream operations enlink’s operations primarily focus on providing midstream energy services including gathering transmission processing fractionation and marketing to producers of natural gas ngls crude oil and condensate including devon enlink also provides crude oil condensate and brine services to producers enlink connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems processes natural gas for the removal of ngls fractionates ngls into purity products and markets those products for a fee transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets further enlink purchases natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities industrial consumers other marketers and pipelines 

oil gas and ngl marketing 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 3 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2015 our production was sold under the following contracts 

 

   

delivery commitments 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2014 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production 

 

 we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves we expect to fulfill our longerterm delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves in certain regions we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves 

our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future commitments however should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments 

customers 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 no purchaser accounted for over 10 percent of our operating revenues 

competition 

see “item 1a risk factors” 

public policy and government regulation 

our industry is subject to regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations which are binding on our industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of canadian oil and gas production crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production net of allowed deductions the royalty percentage is determined on a slidingscale based on crown posted prices the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered  

marketing in canada 

any oil or gas export that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

environmental and occupational regulations 

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to 

 

  

   

  

  

 we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and our industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced 

  

unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells utilize secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the cost to acquire properties certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our oil natural gas and ngl production to downstream markets such midstream systems include enlink’s systems as well as other systems operated by us or third parties when possible we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a 

  

number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and thirdparties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

hedging limits participation in commodity price increases and increases counterparty credit risk exposure 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

our operations are generally subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the united states and canada in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which require substantial compliance costs and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing – several proposals are before the us congress and other federal agencies that if implemented could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation including regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and tribal reservations regulation of air emissions regulation of wastewater discharges from unconventional oil and gas resources and required disclosure of chemicals and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing many states have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws andor regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts in addition some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities andor hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals any new federal state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs delays in development or restrictions on our operations 

income taxes – we are subject to federal state provincial and local income taxes and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow the united states president and other policy makers have proposed provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to united states tax laws applicable to us the most significant change to our business would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs such a change could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

  

climate change – policymakers in the united states and canada are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policymakers at both the united states federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor taxes on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives and discussions to date have focused on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances capandtrade programs could be relevant to us and our operations in several ways first the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases we could therefore be subject to caps and penalties if emissions exceeded the caps second the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases therefore demand for our products could be reduced by imposition of caps and penalties on our customers carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from use of our products by our customers of overriding significance would be the point of regulation or taxation application of caps or taxes on companies such as devon based on carbon content of produced oil and gas volumes rather than on consumer emissions could lead to penalties fees or tax assessments for which there are no mechanisms to pass them through the distribution and consumption chain where fuel use or conservation choices are made moreover because oil and natural gas are used as chemical feed stocks and not solely as fossil fuel applying a carbon tax to oil and gas at the production stage would be excessive with respect to actual carbon emissions from petroleum fuels 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

insurance does not cover all risks 

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to people or loss of life additionally for our nonoperated properties we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 percent reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk war and terrorism our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

  

limited control on properties operated by others 

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

cyber attacks targeting our systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct daily operations concurrently the industry has become the subject of increased levels of cyber attack activity cyber attacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption and may be carried out by third parties or insiders the techniques utilized range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks we apply technical and process controls in line with the national institute of standards  technology framework to secure corporate information assets in addition we participate in information sharing partnerships to collect relevant threat intelligence and proactively identify and mitigate targeted attacks although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks if we were successfully attacked we may incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview of 2014 results 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we accomplish this by executing our strategy which is outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

2014 was a year of strong execution and strengthening of the portfolio for devon we completed three strategic portfolio transformation initiatives that were focused on building value per share 

on february 28 2014 we acquired certain of geosouthern’s eagle ford assets and operations in south texas for approximately 60 billion this acquisition included approximately 250 mmboe of proved reserves additionally since closing the transaction we have produced approximately 24 mmboe from our eagle ford development with oil accounting for approximately 61 of our production from the play 

on march 7 2014 we completed a transaction to combine substantially all of our us midstream assets with crosstex’s assets to form enlink a new midstream business that we control this transaction is described more fully in note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this report subsequent to the formation of enlink’s midstream business enlink acquired additional oil and gas pipeline assets 

the results of operations from our assets contributed to enlink are included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented additionally the results of operations for all assets contributed to enlink are included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the completion of the transaction the portions of enlink’s net earnings and stockholders’ equity not attributable to devon’s controlling interest are shown separately as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings and consolidated balance sheets 

finally we completed our asset divestitures of certain us and canadian properties through two significant transactions on april 1 2014 we sold canadian conventional assets for 28 billion 3125 billion canadian dollars and on august 29 2014 we sold certain us assets for 22 billion 

  

key measures of our performance are summarized below 

 

  

  our 2014 net earnings attributable to devon core earnings core earnings per share and core operating income per boe all increased compared to 2013 the improved 2014 results were driven primarily by increases in production from our retained properties particularly highermargin liquids volumes combined with higher gas and bitumen price realizations enlink’s earnings growth also contributed to improved 2014 results these factors along with our portfolio transformation drove higher earnings and operating cash flow in 2014 

business and industry outlook 

north american crude oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile based on supply and demand dynamics and we expect this volatility to continue into 2015 

in the second half of 2014 crude oil prices began a rapid and significant decline as global supply outpaced demand the decline increased further following opec’s announcement in late november 2014 that it would not reduce its production targets this decline continued into 2015 but has started to stabilize with the west texas intermediate “wti” benchmark generally ranging between 4550 per barrel throughout january and early february 2015 if wti remained at this level throughout 2015 our realized crude price excluding the effects of hedges would decrease approximately 50 compared to 2014 

although natural gas prices improved in 2014 compared to 2013 natural gas continues to be challenged due to an imbalance between supply and demand across north america we expect most natural gas benchmark prices to be lower in 2015 as supply continues to surpass demand 

our industry will be challenged by lower commodity prices however we have strategically positioned our company so that we can prudently continue investing in our portfolio of assets first following our 2014 asset divestitures our portfolio is more focused and we will concentrate our capital programs on the highest return assets in our portfolio we exited 2014 with a production profile comprised of roughly 35 percent oil 20 percent natural gas liquids and 45 percent natural gas recognizing the relative value of crude oil we are devoting the vast majority of our 2015 capital investment toward growing our oil production particularly the sweet grades of oil found in the us 

  

second we have hedged approximately 50 percent of our projected 2015 crude production at a floor price of 91 per barrel and approximately 40 percent of our natural gas production at 417 per mcf these 2015 contracts had an approximate value of 2 billion at december 31 2014 additionally costs for the services we use are declining in response to lower commodity prices these factors will partially mitigate the effects of lower commodity prices 

finally enlink’s growth as a result of recent acquisitions and planned asset dropdowns from devon will generate additional cash resources that can be used for our capital investment 

nevertheless lower commodity prices create headwinds on our business therefore we are projecting a 20 percent decrease in capital spending in 2015 such spending will be focused on the oily assets in our portfolio currently generating the highest returns with this focus on our highest return assets we expect growth in oil production to be between 20 and 25 percent in 2015 

results of operations 

all amounts in this document related to our international operations for the year ended december 31 2012 are presented as discontinued therefore all results from those operations are excluded in the “results of operations” section unless otherwise noted 

  

oil gas and ngl production 

 

   

oil gas and ngl pricing 

 

  

  commodity sales 

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales 

 

 volumes 2014 vs 2013 oil gas and ngl sales increased 985 million due to volumes the primary driver of the increase resulted from a 74 percent increase in our us oil production such growth resulted from our recently acquired eagle ford properties and the continued development of our properties in the permian basin and mississippianwoodford trend properties in addition we continue to grow our ngl production from these plays which resulted in 131 million of additional sales bitumen sales increased 76 million due to 

  

development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada including jackfish 3 which had first sales in 2014 these increases were partially offset by a 20 percent decrease in our 2014 gas production which was impacted by our asset divestitures resulting in a 533 million decline in sales 

volumes 2013 vs 2012 oil gas and ngl sales increased 625 million due to a 15 percent increase in our liquids production partially offset by a 7 percent decline in our gas production oil production was the largest driver of the increase accounting for 85 percent of the higher sales largely due to continued development of our properties in the permian basin the mississippianwoodford trend and the anadarko basin our oil sales increased 531 million bitumen sales increased 65 million due to development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada additionally our ngl sales increased 181 million as a result of continued drilling in the liquidsrich gas portions of the barnett shale and the anadarko basin these increases were partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in our 2013 gas production resulting in a 152 million decline in sales 

prices 2014 vs 2013 oil gas and ngl sales increased 403 million due to a 20 percent increase in our realized prices without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted with a 572 million increase in sales the change in our realized gas price was largely due to higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based additionally our bitumen sales increased 160 million due to a 16 increase in our realized price as a result of tighter bitumen and heavy oil differentials these increases were partially offset by lower oil and ngl realized prices due to lower nymex west texas intermediate index prices and lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas index 

prices 2013 vs 2012 oil gas and ngl sales increased 744 million due to an 18 percent increase in our realized prices without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted with a 639 million increase in sales the change in our gas price was largely due to higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based our liquid sales increased 105 million due to higher oil and bitumen sales partially offset by lower ngl sales the largest contributors to the higher liquids prices were an increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price and a slightly higher bitumen realized price partially offset by lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses 

 

   

 cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments a summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in note 3 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars basis swaps and call options to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we sold gas and oil call options for 2015 through 2016 the call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives generated net gains of 20 billion in 2014 incurred net losses of 191 million in 2013 and generated net gains of 693 million in 2012 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating expenses 

 

 2014 vs 2013 marketing and midstream operating profit increased 339 million or 66 percent from the year ended december 31 2013 to the year ended december 31 2014 

  

our profit largely increased due to higher prices and volumes partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of the 339 million increase 342 million was attributed to enlink’s operations higher profits from enlink’s texas segment which includes the bridgeport facility and louisiana segment were the largest drivers of the increase the louisiana segment operating profit increased due to acquisitions and completions of additional pipelines 

devon’s marketing activities were the primary driver of the increases in both operating revenues and product purchases the higher marketing revenues and product purchases are primarily due to commitments we have entered into to secure capacity on downstream oil pipelines marketing activities of enlink also contributed to these increases 

2013 vs 2012 marketing and midstream operating profit increased 104 million or 25 percent from the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2013 

our profit largely increased due to the effects of pricing and marketing activities our profit increased nearly 40 million due to our ngl and gas marketing additionally changes in pricing led to an increase in operating profit of approximately 32 million higher residue natural gas prices were the primary contributor to the higher profit 

higher gathering and processing volumes were responsible for an increase in operating profit of 21 million higher volumes were primarily the result of ngl production the increase was largely driven by higher inlet volumes at the cana processing facility improved efficiencies at the cana and bridgeport processing facilities and downtime impacting our bridgeport processing facility in 2012 

operations and maintenance expenses decreased 10 million or 5 percent primarily due to expenditures for regulatory testing in 2012 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

 2014 vs 2013 our absolute loe changed largely as a result of our portfolio transformation initiatives including our february 2014 purchase of geosouthern’s eagle ford assets and our 2014 divestitures of certain properties in the us and canada higher volumes from development of our eagle ford assets as well as our permian basin assets caused us loe to increase this increase was partially offset by the decrease resulting from the us divestitures the canadian divestitures were the primary cause of the decrease in canadian loe 

total loe increased 052 per boe primarily due to higher unit costs related to our canadian operations the higher canadian unit costs largely resulted from the divestiture of the conventional assets in the second quarter of 2014 which resulted in lower total volumes while retaining the relatively highercost thermal heavy oil operations additionally higher jackfish royalties paid in 2014 also contributed to higher canadian unit costs as 

  

canadian royalties increase our net production volumes decrease causing upward pressure on our perunit operating costs the higher unit cost in the us was primarily related to our liquids production growth particularly in the permian basin and mississippianwoodford trend where projects generate higher revenues but generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects additionally we experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which also contributed to the higher loe per boe 

2013 vs 2012 loe increased 067 per boe largely because of our liquids production growth particularly in the permian basin and the mississippianwoodford trend in the us these projects generally require a higher per unit cost than our gas projects particularly because they are in the early stages of development additionally we conducted a turnaround at jackfish 2 in the third quarter of 2013 contributing to higher unit costs in 2013 we also experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which increased loe per boe 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

 2014 vs 2013 net ga and net ga per boe increased largely due to higher employee compensation and benefits and 22 million in costs in the first quarter of 2014 related to the enlink and geosouthern transactions the higher employee compensation and benefits costs were primarily related to sharebased awards which cause our ga to be higher in the period in which our annual sharebased grant is made the grant related to our 2013 compensation cycle was made in the first quarter of 2014 the grant related to our 2012 compensation cycle was made in the fourth quarter of 2012 additionally the expansion of our workforce as a part of growing production operations at certain of our key areas also contributed to the increase 

2013 vs 2012 net ga and net ga per boe decreased largely due to lower personnel expenses and office rent as a result of the houston office consolidation in 2012 and lower costs as a result of the companywide implementation of sap in 2012 higher reimbursements due to increased liquids drilling activity and reimbursement rates also contributed to the decrease in net ga and net ga per boe further reducing our ga in 2013 was the timing of our sharebased awards as noted above 

production and property taxes 

 

   

2014 vs 2013 production and property taxes increased primarily due to an increase in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

2013 vs 2012 production and property taxes increased primarily due to an increase in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

 a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 

2014 vs 2013 dda from our oil and gas properties increased in 2014 largely due to higher dda rates the higher rates resulted from our oil and gas drilling and development activities and the geosouthern acquisition which were partially offset by the asset impairments recognized in 2013 and the asset divestitures other dda increased primarily due to the enlink transaction 

2013 vs 2012 oil and gas property dda decreased 61 million largely as a result of the asset impairment charges recognized in 2012 and 2013 depreciation and amortization on our other properties increased 30 million largely from the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city and natural gas pipeline development in the canawoodford shale 

asset impairments 

 

 for further discussion of our goodwill and property and equipment impairments see note 12 and note 5 respectively in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

restructuring costs 

 

 for further discussion of our canadian divestitures office consolidation and offshore divestiture restructuring activities and consolidated financial statements impact see note 6 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

gains on asset sales 

in conjunction with the divestiture of certain canadian properties we recognized gains in the first and second quarters of 2014 under full cost accounting rules sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no recognition of a gain or loss however if not recognizing a gain or loss on the disposition would otherwise significantly alter the relationship between a cost center’s capitalized costs and proved reserves then a gain or loss must be recognized our canadian divestitures significantly altered such relationship therefore we recognized a total gain of 11 billion 06 billion aftertax during 2014 

net financing costs 

 

 2014 vs 2013 net financing costs increased primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from the enlink and geosouthern transactions additionally we incurred a 40 million early retirement premium related to the redemption of our 24 500 million senior notes due 2016 12 650 million senior notes due 2016 and 1875 750 million senior notes due 2017 prior to their maturity in conjunction with the early retirement we also expensed 8 million in remaining unamortized discount and issuance costs 

2013 vs 2012 net financing costs increased primarily due to additional debt borrowings and associated fees partially offset by lower weightedaverage interest rates and higher capitalized interest borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow and to provide funding for our eagle ford acquisition which closed in the first quarter of 2014 

  

income taxes 

the following table presents our total income tax expense benefit and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the united states statutory income tax rate 

 

 for further discussion of our income tax expense benefit see note 7 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

in 2012 we incurred a loss related to discontinued operations of 16 million 21 million net of taxes for the sale of our assets in angola there were no operating revenues related to discontinued operations during 2012 in 2014 and 2013 there were no earnings or losses associated with discontinued operations 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

 operating cash flow – continuing operations 

net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2014 our operating cash flow increased 10 percent during 2014 primarily due to higher realized prices and 

  

liquids production growth partially offset by higher expenses our operating cash flow increased 10 percent during 2013 primarily due to higher commodity prices and production growth partially offset by higher expenses 

excluding the 65 billion attributable to the geosouthern and other acquisitions our operating cash flow funded approximately 86 percent of our cash payments for capital expenditures during 2014 leveraging our liquidity we used cash balances shortterm debt and divestiture proceeds to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures 

divestitures of property and equipment 

during 2014 we completed our canadian asset divestiture program and received proceeds of approximately 29 billion additionally we completed the divestment of certain of our us assets and received proceeds of approximately 22 billion 

in 2013 we sold our thunder creek operations in wyoming for approximately 148 million and our bear paw basin assets in havre montana for approximately 73 million we also sold other minor oil and gas assets 

during 2012 we closed two key joint venture transactions under one of these arrangements our joint venture partner paid approximately 900 million in cash and received a 333 percent interest in five of our exploration plays in the us our joint venture partner is also funding approximately 16 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays under the second transaction our joint venture partner paid approximately 400 million and received a 30 percent interest in the cline and midlandwolfcamp shale plays in texas additionally our joint venture partner is funding approximately 10 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays 

also in 2012 we sold our west johnson county plant and gathering system in north texas for approximately 90 million and divested our angola operations for approximately 71 million 

capital expenditures 

 

 our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations other corporate activities and enlink growth and maintenance activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties which totaled 119 billion 60 billion and 74 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 

  

increase in capital spending was primarily due to the geosouthern acquisition excluding acquisitions exploration and development capital spending decreased 4 percent primarily due to utilization of the drilling carries in 2014 from our joint venture arrangements in 2013 utilization of these drilling carries contributed to a 20 percent decline in exploration development and acquisition capital spending along with a decline in new venture acreage acquisitions exploration and development capital spending in 2012 was primarily related to new venture acreage acquisitions and increased drilling and development with rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures we increased our onshore north american acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive nearterm growth of our oil production 

capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas systems and oil pipelines our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by our oil and gas drilling activities our 2014 and 2013 midstream capital expenditures largely related to the expansion of our access pipeline in canada additionally our 2014 midstream capital expenditures also related to pipeline construction and expansion in the eagle ford during 2014 enlink’s capital expenditures totaled approximately 10 billion the higher expenditures primarily resulted from the acquisition of additional oil and gas pipeline assets enlink’s 2013 and 2012 capital expenditures primarily related to expansions of plants serving the barnett shale and canawoodford shale 

capital expenditures related to other activities decreased in 2014 and 2013 compared to 2012 this decrease is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city which was completed in 2012 

debt activity net 

during 2014 we decreased our net debt borrowings by 22 billion the decrease was primarily related to the repayment of debt used to fund the geosouthern transaction this was partially offset by 555 million of net borrowings from enlink to fund its operations 

during 2013 we increased our debt borrowings by 361 million as a result of issuing 225 billion of debt related to the planned eagle ford acquisition and repaying approximately 19 billion of outstanding shortterm debt 

during 2012 we increased our debt borrowings by 19 billion as a result of issuing 25 billion of longterm debt and repaying approximately 06 billion of outstanding shortterm debt the additional borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow 

shareholder and noncontrolling interests distributions 

the following table summarizes our common stock dividends amounts in millions in the second quarter of 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend to 024 per share 

 

 in conjunction with the formation of enlink in the first quarter of 2014 we made a payment of 100 million to noncontrolling interests further enlink and its general partner distributed 135 million to nondevon unitholders during 2014 

stock option proceeds 

we received 93 million 3 million and 27 million from stock option proceeds in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

proceeds from issuance of subsidiary units 

during 2014 enlink sold approximately 148 million limited partner units to the public raising net proceeds of approximately 410 million 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain a commercial paper program supported by our revolving line of credit which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances other available sources of capital and liquidity include debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section 

operating cash flow and cash balances 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce due to higher realized prices and increased liquids production growth during 2014 our operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 10 percent to 60 billion in 2014 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control in the fourth quarter of 2014 oil and ngl prices decreased significantly we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2015 and expect 2015 oil gas and ngl prices will be noticeably lower than those for 2014 the corresponding reduction in our operating cash flow will require us to scale back certain uses of cash during 2015 compared to 2014 including most notably our capital expenditures 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various derivative financial instruments to set minimum prices on our future production the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2014 are presented in note 3 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report additional discussion on the extent of our hedged production is included in the “business and industry outlook” section above 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also generally true during periods of depressed commodity prices or reduced activity 

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2014 we had total debt of 113 billion with an overall weightedaverage borrowing rate of 46 percent of the 113 billion of total debt 20 billion is comprised of floating rate debt that bear interest rates averaging 074 percent 

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate additionally we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

  

as recent years indicate we have a history of investing more than 100 percent of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make 

at the end of 2014 we held approximately 15 billion of cash included in this total was 12 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries we would recognize and pay current income taxes in accordance with current u s tax law the payment of such additional income tax would decrease the amount of cash ultimately available to fund our business 

credit availability 

we have a 30 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the senior credit facility the maturity date for 30 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2017 the maturity date for 164 million of the senior credit facility is october 24 2018 the maturity date for the remaining 28 billion is october 24 2019 this credit facility supports our 30 billion commercial paper program amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 percent the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling and goodwill impairments as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2014 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 209 percent 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

we also have access to 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2014 we had 932 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

enlink has a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility on february 5 2015 the commitments under enlink’s credit facility were increased to 15 billion the general partner also has a 250 million revolving credit facility as of december 31 2014 there were 14 million in outstanding letters of credit and 237 million borrowed under the 10 billion credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under the 250 million credit facility all of enlink’s and the general partner’s debt is nonrecourse to devon 

  

debt ratings 

we and enlink receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us however the general partner does not receive debt ratings in determining those debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales nearterm and longterm growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our or enlink’s debt contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should debt ratings fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it could adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade from our current debt ratings would increase the drawn borrowing costs by 125 basis points similarly a ratings downgrade would not accelerate enlink’s scheduled maturities however it could adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under enlink’s credit facility under the terms of enlink’s credit facility a one notch downgrade would increase the drawn borrowing costs by 25 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our and enlink’s ability to economically access debt markets in the future 

capital expenditures 

excluding enlink our 2015 capital expenditures are expected to range from 47 billion to 52 billion including 45 billion to 49 billion for our oil and gas operations which include capitalized ga and interest this estimate is approximately 20 lower than our 2014 capital expenditures to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2015 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2015 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2015 our existing commodity hedging contracts available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2015 capital expenditures 

additionally our financial and operational flexibility has been further enhanced by the joint venture transactions that we entered into in 2012 pursuant to the joint venture agreements our joint venture partners are subject to drilling carries with remaining commitments that totaled approximately 250 million at the end of 2014 these drilling carries will fund 70 percent of our capital requirements related to joint venture properties which results in our partners paying approximately 80 percent of the overall development costs during the carry period this has allowed us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of the joint venture properties without diverting capital from our core development projects we expect a significant portion of the carries will be utilized by the end of 2015 

enlink capital resources and expenditures 

on january 31 2015 enlink acquired lpc crude oil marketing llc which has crude oil gathering transportation and marketing operations in the permian basin for approximately 100 million in cash subject to certain adjustments 

on february 1 2015 enlink signed a definitive agreement to acquire coronado midstream holdings llc which owns natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the permian basin for approximately 600 million in cash and equity subject to certain adjustments 

beyond these acquisitions enlink’s 2015 capital budget includes approximately 350 million to 400 million of identified growth projects including capitalized interest enlink’s primary capital projects for 2015 

  

include the construction of its orv condensate pipeline bearkat plant facilities and west texas expansion project during 2014 enlink invested in several capital projects which primarily included the expansion of the cajunsibon ngl pipeline and the construction of the bearkat facilities 

enlink expects to fund its 2015 maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows enlink expects to fund the growth capital expenditures from the proceeds of borrowings under its bank credit facility and proceeds from other debt and equity sources in 2015 it is possible that not all of the planned projects will be commenced or completed enlink’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond its control 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 is provided in the following table 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 contingencies and legal matters 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 18 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by outside petroleum consultants in 2014 91 percent of our reserves were subjected to such audits 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than three percent of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such rules also dictate that a 10 percent discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

  

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 percent discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it generally is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition due to the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

although uncertain future prices impact the ability to predict future full cost writedowns we do expect to recognize full cost writedowns in 2015 beginning with the first quarter of 2015 this conclusion is based on the historic prices for the last 9 months of 2014 and the shortterm pricing outlook although we can predict with relative certainty we will recognize full cost writedowns in 2015 we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts however we expect the amounts will be material to our net earnings but will have no impact to our cash flow or liquidity 

derivative financial instruments 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production to hedge future prices received additionally enlink periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to its oil gas and ngl marketing activity these commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using united states treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of our interest rate swaps we generally receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest rate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

  

we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates under the terms of our foreign exchange forward contracts we generally receive us dollars and pay canadian dollars based on a total notional amount 

we estimate the fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward exchange rates the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our observation of forward foreign exchange rates the resulting future cash inflows or outflows at maturity of the contracts are discounted using treasury rates these discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties 

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our oil gas and ngl commodity derivative contracts are held with fourteen separate counterparties and our foreign exchange forward contracts are held with five separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

business combinations 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies a historical 12month average price to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and 

  

demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance 

in addition our acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations included substantial midstream activities in these transactions the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of midstream facilities and equipment generally consisting of processing facilities and pipeline systems estimating the fair value of these assets requires certain assumptions to be made regarding future quantities of commodities estimated to be processed and transported through these facilities and pipelines as well as estimates of future expected prices and operating and capital costs 

goodwill 

we test goodwill for impairment annually at october 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable while we use data as of october 31 for our test we typically complete the test in late december or early january as the october 31 market data used in our test becomes available we first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test is performed 

in the first step of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses including comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment in the second step the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the determination of fair value requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations operating margins and capital expenditures 

for our october 31 2014 impairment test step one of our impairment analysis showed that the fair value of our us and enlink reporting units exceeded their carrying value however the fair value of the enlink louisiana reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value as of october 31 2014 the fair value of the enlink louisiana reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14 percent furthermore the fair value of our canadian reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value 

  

as disclosed in previous years the fair value of our canadian unit did not significantly exceed its carrying value consequently we performed the requisite qualitative analysis of our canadian goodwill each quarter throughout 2014 we also performed quantitative analysis following the significant canadian asset divestitures we completed in the second quarter of 2014 none of this analysis indicated the existence of a canadian goodwill impairment through september 30 2014 therefore with the failure of step one as a result of our october 31 test we concluded the impairment was the result of the decline in oil prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 and intensified after opec’s decision not to reduce its production targets that was announced in late november 2014 

because the oil price decline continued into early 2015 we decided to perform a revised step one and then step two of the impairment test as of december 31 2014 to measure the amount of the canadian impairment as a result of this evaluation we concluded the implied fair value of our canadian goodwill was zero as of december 31 2014 consequently in the fourth quarter of 2014 we wrote off our remaining canadian goodwill and recognized a 19 billion impairment 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters 

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing united states income tax laws particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and repatriations of foreign earnings changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities 

 

  

  

  

   

because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impracticable to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies 

nongaap measures 

we make reference to “core earnings attributable to devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to devon” in “overview of 2014 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures core earnings attributable to devon as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure items may appear to be recurring while comparing on an annual basis in the below table restructuring costs were incurred in each of the three year periods however these costs relate to different restructuring programs amounts excluded for 2014 relate to derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes asset impairments including an impairment of goodwill our divestiture programs and related gains on asset sales repatriation of proceeds to the us restructuring costs loss on early retirement of debt and deferred income tax on the formation of enlink amounts excluded for 2013 relate to our office consolidation and asset impairments amounts excluded in 2012 relate to our office consolidation offshore exit and asset impairments for more information on our restructuring programs see note 6 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers 

below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures the reconciliations exclude amounts related to our discontinued operations 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas production pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production through various financial transactions that hedge future prices received the key terms to all our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2014 are presented in note 3 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2014 a 10 percent increase or a 10 percent decrease in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts 

 

 interest rate risk 

at december 31 2014 we had total debt of 113 billion of this amount 93 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 54 percent of the 113 billion of total debt 20 billion is comprised of floating rate debt that bear interest rates averaging 074 percent our commercial paper borrowings typically have maturities between 1 and 90 days 

as of december 31 2014 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – note 3” in this report the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the 3 month libor rate a 10 percent change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet at december 31 2014 

foreign currency risk 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 percent unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2014 balance sheet 

  

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however one of these foreign subsidiaries holds canadiandollar cash and engages in intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are based in canadian dollars the value of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the us dollar functional currency additionally at december 31 2014 we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans the increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the us dollar equivalent of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans based on the amount of the cash and intercompany loans as of december 31 2014 a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

general 

devon energy corporation “devon” is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration development and production of oil natural gas and ngls our operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the us and canada our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable environmentally responsible production and a platform for future growth we have nearly doubled our onshore north american oil production since 2008 and have a deep inventory of development opportunities to deliver future oil growth we produce about 24 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day – more than 3 percent of all the gas consumed in north america we also own natural gas pipelines plants and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas making us one of north america’s larger processors of natural gas 

devon pioneered the commercial development of natural gas from shale and coalbed formations and we are a proven leader in using steam to produce bitumen from the canadian oil sands a delaware corporation formed in 1971 we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 333 west sheridan oklahoma city ok 731025015 telephone 4052353611 as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 5900 employees

strategy 

our primary goal is to build value per share in pursuit of this objective we focus on growing cash flow per share adjusted for debt which has the greatest longterm correlation to share price appreciation in our industry we also focus on growth in earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we do this by 

 

  

  

  

  

 we hold 14 million net acres of which roughly 60 percent are undeveloped providing us with a platform for future growth an important factor in determining the direction of our growth strategy particularly our capital allocation is the current and forecasted pricing applicable to our production our industry had been operating in an environment that had involved depressed north american gas prices contrasted with more robust prices for oil 

  

and ngls consequently we have focused our recent capital programs on highermargin oil and liquidsbased resource capture and development with recent changes in market conditions that have led to challenged prices for ngls and canadian heavy oil we are refining our capital allocations as needed and evaluating other investment opportunities to maximize and accelerate growth in cash flow per debtadjusted share 

in pursuit of our goal to build value per share we entered into two significant agreements near the end of 2013 on november 20 2013 we entered into an agreement with geosouthern intermediate holdings llc to acquire certain oil and gas properties leasehold mineral interests and related assets located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 6 billion in cash the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 and we have the necessary financing in place to fund the acquisition 

on october 21 2013 devon crosstex energy inc and crosstex energy lp collectively “crosstex” announced plans to combine substantially all of devon’s us midstream assets with crosstex’s assets to form a new midstream business the new business will consist of enlink midstream partners lp the “partnership” and enlink midstream llc “enlink” respectively a master limited partnership and a general partner entity which will both be publicly traded entities 

in exchange for a controlling interest in both enlink and the partnership devon will contribute its equity interest in a newly formed devon subsidiary “enlink holdings” and 100 million in cash enlink holdings will own devon’s midstream assets in the barnett shale in north texas and the cana and arkoma woodford shales in oklahoma as well as devon’s economic interest in gulf coast fractionators in mt belvieu texas the partnership and enlink will each own 50 of enlink holdings the completion of these transactions is subject to crosstex energy inc shareholder approval devon expects crosstex energy inc shareholders will approve the transaction allowing devon and crosstex to complete the transaction near the end of the first quarter of 2014 

upon closing of the transactions the pro forma ownership of enlink will be approximately 

 

  

 upon closing of the transactions the pro forma ownership of the partnership will be approximately 

 

  

  

 in conjunction with the announcement of the geosouthern acquisition we also announced plans to divest certain noncore properties located throughout canada and the u s on february 19 2014 we announced our first transaction as a part of this divestiture program in which we agreed to sell the majority of our canadian conventional assets to canadian natural resources limited for approximately 28 billion 3125 billion in canadian dollars we expect this noncore divestiture program will generate organizational and operational efficiencies and will allow us to allocate capital and employee resources to highervalue properties and prospects we expect to complete the majority of the divestitures by the end of 2014 once the geosouthern acquisition and noncore divestitures are complete we expect oil production will represent more than 30 of our production profile 

  

oil and gas properties 

property profiles 

the locations of our key properties are presented on the following map these properties include those that currently have significant proved reserves and production as well as properties that do not currently have significant levels of proved reserves or production but are expected to be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production 

 

  

the following table outlines a summary of key data in each of our operating areas for 2013 notes 21 and 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas in the following table and throughout this report we convert our proved reserves and production to boe gas proved reserves and production are converted to boe at the rate of six mcf of gas per bbl of oil based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil bitumen and ngl proved reserves and production are converted to boe on a onetoone basis with oil 

 

 core and emerging properties 

anadarko basin – our acreage is located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian blaine caddo and dewey counties the anadarko basin is a nonconventional reservoir and produces natural gas ngls and condensate 

the anadarko basin has rapidly emerged as one of the most economic shale plays in north america we are the largest leaseholder and the largest producer in the anadarko basin during 2013 we increased our production by 14 percent we have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2014 we plan to drill approximately 95 wells 

in addition we have a significant processing plant and gathering system to service these properties our cana plant currently has 350 mmcf per day of total capacity 

barnett shale  – this is our largest property both in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas the barnett shale is a nonconventional reservoir producing natural gas ngls and condensate 

we are the largest producer in the barnett shale since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to enhance production and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in north america we have drilled in excess of 5000 wells in the barnett shale since 2002 yet we still have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2014 we plan to drill approximately 80 wells focused in the areas with the highest liquids content 

in addition we have a significant processing plant and gathering system in north texas to service these properties our bridgeport plant is one of the largest processing plants in the us currently with 790 mmcf per day of total capacity these midstream assets also include an extensive pipeline system and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator 

  

mississippianwoodford trend – these properties represent some of our newest assets with most of our position acquired since 2011 located in northern oklahoma and southern kansas these acres target oil in the mississippian lime and woodford shale these areas are being explored and developed under our joint venture arrangement with sinopec and independently by us on the acreage outside of our area of mutual interest with sinopec in 2014 we plan to drill approximately 230 wells 

permian basin – our acreage is located in various counties in west texas and southeast new mexico these properties have been a legacy asset for us and continue to offer both exploration and lowrisk development opportunities we entered into a joint venture arrangement with sumitomo in 2012 covering approximately 650000 net acres in the cline shale and midlandwolfcamp shale further strengthening the capital efficiency of our exploration programs in addition to the cline and wolfcamp shale activity our current drilling activity continues to target conventional and nonconventional oil and liquidsrich gas targets within the conventional delaware bone spring midlandwolfcamp wolfberry and avalon shale plays in 2014 we plan to drill approximately 350 wells 

rockies – our operations are focused in the powder river basin in wyoming where we have 150000 net acres these acres are principally located in eastern wyoming in the counties of campbell converse and johnson we are currently targeting several cretaceous oil objectives including the turner frontier and parkman formations to date we have identified roughly 600 risked locations across these three formations our activity and associated capital in the powder river basin is a part of our joint venture agreement with sinopec corporation under which we receive a drilling carry that funds a significant portion of our capital requirements during the carry period in 2014 we plan to drill roughly 25 wells in the powder river basin 

canadian heavy oil – we are the first and only usbased independent energy company to develop and operate a bitumen oil sands project in canada we currently have two main projects jackfish and pike located in alberta canada in addition our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta and western saskatchewan lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection 

jackfish is our thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we are employing steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the first phase of jackfish is fully operational with a gross facility capacity of 35 mbbls per day jackfish production increased 8 percent in 2013 as the second phase of jackfish which came online in the second quarter of 2011 continued to increase production construction of a third phase began in 2012 with plant startup expected by yearend 2014 we expect each phase to maintain a flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average net production rate of approximately 2530 mbbls per day 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2013 we filed a regulatory application in 2012 for the first phase of this project with gross capacity of 105 mbbls per day in which we hold a 50 percent interest 

to facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production we have a 50 percent interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish and eventually our pike heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale the access pipeline system is currently undergoing a capacity expansion that we anticipate will be completed in late 2014 this expansion is expected to create adequate capacity to transport our anticipated jackfish and pike heavy oil production to the edmonton market hub additionally it will increase the transport capacity of condensate diluent available at our thermal oil facilities 

our lloydminster region is welldeveloped with significant infrastructure and is primarily accessible yearround for drilling lloydminster is a lowrisk high margin oil development play we have drilled approximately 2700 wells in the area since 2003 in 2014 we plan to drill approximately 175 wells 

  

noncore properties 

our noncore properties are located throughout the us and canada and primarily consist of reservoirs that produce dry natural gas we are in the process of monetizing these assets through a divestiture program we expect to complete by the end of 2014 

proved reserves 

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property see note 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2013 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates including any or all of the following 

 

  

  

  

 the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past thirteen years including the past five in his current position during his career he has been responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team in this role he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to the mobile bay norphlet discoveries gulf of mexico shelf cascade lower tertiary development gulf of mexico deepwater and polvo development campos basin brazil 

the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our vice president of budget and reserves who reports to our chief financial officer no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2013 we engaged two such firms to audit 91 percent of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited 92 percent of our 2013 us reserves and deloitte audited 90 percent of our canadian reserves 

“audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants at those meetings the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the following table presents our estimated pretax cash flow information related to its proved reserves these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

 

  

 pretax future net revenue and pretax 10 percent present value are nongaap measures the present value of aftertax future net revenues discounted at 10 percent per annum “standardized measure” was 157 billion at the end of 2013 included as part of standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of 56 billion excluding these taxes the present value of our pretax future net revenue “pretax 10 percent present value” was 213 billion we believe the pretax 10 percent present value is a useful measure in addition to the aftertax standardized measure the pretax 10 percent present value assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies the aftertax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company while the pretax 10 percent present value is based on prices and discount factors which are more consistent from company to company 

  

production production prices and production costs 

the following table presents production price and cost information for each significant field country and continent 

 

  

   

drilling statistics 

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results 

 

  

 the following table presents the february 1 2014 results of our wells that were in progress on december 31 2013 

 

  

  productive wells 

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2013 

 

  

   the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs 

  

field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 24000 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2013 the acreage in the table includes 07 million 14 million and 06 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively approximately 18 mmboe or 25 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves was attributable to this expiring acreage as of december 31 2013 of the 27 million net acres set to expire by december 31 2016 we will perform operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for a portion of the acreage including all the acreage for which we have proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2013 however we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business in 2013 we allowed approximately 50 of our expiring acreage to expire 

 

  

  title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

marketing and midstream activities 

our marketing and midstream operations provide gathering compression treating processing fractionation and marketing services to us and other third parties we generate revenues from these operations by collecting service fees and selling processed gas and ngls the expenses associated with these operations primarily consist of the costs to operate our gathering systems plants and related facilities as well as purchases of gas and ngls 

oil gas and ngl marketing 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

  

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2014 our production was sold under the following contracts 

 

 delivery commitments 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2013 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production 

 

 we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves we expect to fulfill our longerterm delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves in certain regions we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves 

our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future commitments however should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments 

customers 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 no purchaser accounted for over 10 percent of our operating revenues

see “item 1a risk factors” 

public policy and government regulation 

the oil and natural gas industry is subject to regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations taxes fees and other policy implementation actions affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations which are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and 

  

existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations differently than they would affect other oil and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation 

our oil and gas operations are subject to federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well 

  

productivity geographical location and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced occasionally the federal and provincial governments of canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally increase our revenues earnings and cash flow 

marketing in canada 

any oil or gas export that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

environmental and occupational regulations 

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to 

 

  

  

  

  

 we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary yet manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies 

  

identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the cost to acquire properties certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our production to downstream markets such midstream systems include the systems we operate as well as systems operated by third parties when possible we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including 

  

but not limited to weather conditions accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and thirdparties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

hedging limits participation in commodity price increases and increases counterparty credit risk exposure 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

our operations are generally subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the united states and canada in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which require substantial compliance costs and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing – the bureau of land management is considering the possibility of additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federal and indian lands currently regulation of hydraulic fracturing is conducted primarily at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements we lease federal and indian lands and would be affected by the interior department proposal if it were to become law 

income taxes – we are subject to federal state provincial and local income taxes and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow recently the united states president and other policy makers have proposed provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to united states tax laws applicable to us the most significant change to our business would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs such a change could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

climate change – policymakers in the united states and canada are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policymakers at both the united states federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor taxes on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives and discussions to date have focused 

  

on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances capandtrade programs could be relevant to us and our operations in several ways first the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases we could therefore be subject to caps and penalties if emissions exceeded the caps second the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases therefore demand for our products could be reduced by imposition of caps and penalties on our customers carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from use of our products by our customers of overriding significance would be the point of regulation or taxation application of caps or taxes on companies such as devon based on carbon content of produced oil and gas volumes rather than on consumer emissions could lead to penalties fees or tax assessments for which there are no mechanisms to pass them through the distribution and consumption chain where fuel use or conservation choices are made moreover because oil and natural gas are used as chemical feedstocks and not solely as fossil fuel applying a carbon tax to oil and gas at the production stage would be excessive with respect to actual carbon emissions from petroleum fuels 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

insurance does not cover all risks 

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to people or loss of life additionally for our nonoperated properties we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 percent reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk war and terrorism our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

limited control on properties operated by others 

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount of 

  

required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

cyber attacks targeting our systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

the oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct daily operations concurrently the industry has become the subject of increased levels of cyber attack activity cyber attacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption and may be carried out by third parties or insiders the techniques utilized range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as by causing denialofservice attacks although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks if we were successfully attacked we may incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences finally as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview of 2013 results 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we accomplish this by executing our strategy which is outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

2013 was another year of strong execution and exciting change for devon our oilfocused drilling programs not only accomplished impressive oil production growth but also expanded margins and improved operating cash flow additionally we took steps to highgrade our portfolio we did this by announcing an accretive eagle ford shale acquisition an innovative midstream combination and the initiation of an asset divestiture program these actions will provide the platform from which we will deliver outstanding highmargin growth in 2014 and for many years to come 

key measures of our 2013 performance are summarized below which exclude amounts from our discontinued operations 

 

  

   our 2013 net loss resulted from noncash asset impairments which reduced our earnings by 20 billion 14 billion after tax excluding the asset impairments and other items typically excluded by securities analysts our adjusted earnings were 17 billion or 426 per diluted share this compares to adjusted earnings of 13 billion or 322 per diluted share in 2012 

  

our 2013 adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income per boe all increased compared to 2012 the improved 2013 results were driven primarily by increases in gas prices oil volumes and oil realizations these factors also contributed to higher adjusted operating cash flow which combined with a reduction in capitalized costs caused our cash flow deficit to narrow considerably in 2013 

business and industry outlook 

north american crude oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile based on supply and demand dynamics and we expect this volatility to continue into 2014 although natural gas prices improved in 2013 compared to 2012 natural gas continues to be challenged due to an imbalance between supply and demand across north america however arctic air movements across north america during the early weeks of 2014 have caused natural gas demand to surge as storage inventories have significantly declined in response to the recent weather conditions natural gas prices have surpassed 5 per mcf for the first time since the summer of 2010 further helping demand new uses of natural gas in industrial power and other sectors will continue to help support price dynamics nevertheless we still expect natural gas prices to be rangebound as natural gas supply continues to grow particularly in the us looking to 2014 we expect natural gas prices will remain relatively consistent or possibly increase moderately from 2013 levels 

similar to natural gas in recent years a surge in the supply of natural gas liquids has kept prices challenged the majority of our natural gas is comprised of ethane one of the most pricechallenged liquids processed from the natural gas stream we expect 2014 natural gas liquids prices will be rangebound and remain relatively flat compared to 2013 

crude oil prices remained relatively stable throughout 2013 and oil continues to be more valuable than natural gas on a relative energyequivalent basis as a result we and other producers have been focused on growing oil production north american crude oil supply continues to increase due to the continued use of horizontal drilling technology throughout the us and expansions of heavy oil production operations primarily in canada global crude oil demand is expected to grow with supply in 2014 as crude oil supply grows transportation capacity to downstream markets will be increasingly important bottlenecks and other transportation limitations may continue to add volatility among us and canadian grades of oil however we expect 2014 oil prices will remain relatively consistent with 2013 

we exited 2013 with a production profile comprised of roughly 55 percent natural gas 25 percent oil and 20 percent natural gas liquids recognizing the relative value of crude oil we are devoting the vast majority of our 2014 capital investment toward growing our oil production particularly the sweet grades of oil found in the us to make a significant shift in our production profile we expect to complete a 6 billion acquisition of eagle ford shale assets in the first quarter of 2014 and divest noncore dry natural gas assets throughout 2014 once these transactions are complete we expect oil will represent more than 30 percent of our production profile 

further enhancing the value of our assets we are combining substantially all of our us midstream assets with crosstex energy inc’s and crosstex energy lp’s assets to form a new midstream business the new business will consist of enlink midstream partners lp the “partnership” and enlink midstream llc “enlink” a master limited partnership and a general partner entity which will both be publicly traded entities the new midstream business will own devon’s midstream assets in the barnett shale in north texas and the cana and arkoma woodford shales in oklahoma as well as devon’s economic interest in gulf coast fractionators in mt belvieu texas devon will own a 70 percent controlling interest in enlink and an approximate 53 percent controlling interest in the partnership

oil gas and ngl production 

 

   

oil gas and ngl pricing 

 

  

 commodity sales 

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales 

 

 volumes 2013 vs 2012 – upstream sales increased 625 million due to a 15 percent increase in our liquids production partially offset by a 7 percent decline in our gas production oil production was the largest driver of the increase accounting for 85 percent of the higher sales largely due to continued development of our properties in the permian basin the mississippianwoodford trend and the anadarko basin our oil sales increased 531 million bitumen sales increased 65 million due to development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada additionally our ngl sales increased 181 million as a result of continued drilling in the liquidsrich gas portions of the barnett shale and the anadarko basin these increases were partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in our 2013 gas production resulting in a 152 million decline in sales 

volumes 2012 vs 2011 – upstream sales increased 695 million due to a 4 percent increase in production oil and bitumen production were the largest drivers of the increase accounting for nearly 90 percent of the higher sales as a result of continued development of our liquidsrich properties in the permian basin our oil 

  

sales increased 337 million bitumen sales increased 273 million due to development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada additionally our ngl sales increased 137 million as a result of continued drilling in the liquidsrich gas portions of the barnett shale and the anadarko basin these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in our 2012 gas production resulting in a 52 million decline in sales 

prices 2013 vs 2012 – upstream sales increased 744 million due to an 18 percent increase in our realized price without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted with a 639 million increase in sales the change in our gas price was largely due to higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based our liquid sales increased 105 million due to higher oil and bitumen sales partially offset by lower ngl sales the largest contributors to the higher liquids prices were an increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price and a slightly higher bitumen realized price partially offset by lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub 

prices 2012 vs 2011 – upstream sales decreased 19 billion due to a 17 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted with a 11 billion decrease in sales the change in our gas price was largely due to fluctuations of the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based we also experienced declines in our ngl bitumen and oil sales due to our realized price the largest contributors to the lower liquids prices were lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub and wider bitumen differentials 

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and fair value gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of fair value gains and losses 

 

  

   

 cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments a summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars basis swaps and call options to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we sold gas and oil call options for 2014 through 2016 the call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize fair value changes on our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives incurred net losses of 191 million in 2013 and generated net gains of 693 million and 881 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

 2013 vs 2012 marketing and midstream operating profit increased 104 million or 25 percent from the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2013 

our profit largely increased due to the effects of pricing and marketing activities our profit increased nearly 40 million due to our ngl and gas marketing additionally changes in pricing led to an increase in operating profit of approximately 32 million higher residue natural gas prices were the primary contributor to the higher profit 

higher gathering and processing volumes were responsible for an increase in operating profit of 21 million higher volumes were primarily the result of ngl production the increase was largely driven by higher inlet volumes at the cana processing facility improved efficiencies at the cana and bridgeport processing facilities and downtime impacting our bridgeport processing facility in 2012 

  

operations and maintenance expenses decreased 11 million or 6 percent primarily due to expenditures for regulatory testing in 2012 

2012 vs 2011 marketing and midstream operating profit decreased 124 million or 23 percent from the year ended december 31 2011 to the year ended december 31 2012 

our profit largely decreased due to the effects of pricing and marketing activities changes in pricing led to a decrease in operating profit of approximately 106 million lower residue natural gas and ngl prices were the primary contributor to the lower profit additionally our profit decreased 13 million primarily due to lower profits on our ngl marketing 

higher gathering processing and transportation volumes were responsible for an increase in operating profit of 11 million higher volumes were primarily the result of additional throughput at bridgeport and cana gathering 

operations and maintenance expenses increased 16 million or 9 percent primarily due to expenditures for regulatory testing in 2012 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

 2013 vs 2012 loe increased 067 per boe largely because of our liquids production growth particularly in the permian basin and the mississippianwoodford trend in the us these projects generally require a higher per unit cost than our gas projects particularly because they are in the early stages of development additionally we conducted a turnaround at jackfish 2 in the third quarter of 2013 contributing to higher unit costs in 2013 we also experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which increased loe per boe 

2012 vs 2011 loe increased 059 per boe largely because of our oil production growth particularly at our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada and in the permian basin in the us we also experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which increased loe per boe 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

   

2013 vs 2012 net ga and net ga per boe decreased largely due to lower personnel expenses and office rent as a result of the houston office consolidation in 2012 and lower costs as a result of the companywide implementation of sap in q2 2012 higher reimbursements due to increased liquids drilling activity and reimbursement rates also contributed to the decrease in net ga and net ga per boe 

2012 vs 2011 net ga and net ga per boe increased largely due to higher employee compensation and benefits employee costs increased primarily from an expansion of our workforce as part of growing production operations at certain of our key areas including jackfish the permian basin and the anadarko basin 

production and property taxes 

 

 2013 vs 2012 production and property taxes increased primarily due to an increase in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

2012 vs 2011 production and property taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in our us revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

 a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 

  

2013 vs 2012 oil and gas property dda decreased 61 million largely as a result of the asset impairment charges recognized in 2012 and 2013 depreciation and amortization on our other properties increased 30 million largely from the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city and natural gas pipeline development in the canawoodford shale 

2012 vs 2011 oil and gas property dda increased 460 million due to a 22 percent increase in the dda rate and 79 million due to our 4 percent increase in production the largest contributors to the higher rate were our 2012 drilling and development activities 

asset impairments 

 

 oil and gas impairments 

under the full cost method of accounting capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test which is discussed in note 1 to the financial statements under “item 8 consolidated financial statements” of this report 

the oil and gas impairments resulted primarily from declines in the us and canada full cost ceilings the lower ceiling values resulted primarily from decreases in the 12month average trailing prices for oil natural gas and ngls which have reduced proved reserve values 

midstream impairments 

due to declining natural gas production resulting from low natural gas and ngl prices we determined that the carrying amounts of certain of our midstream facilities were not recoverable from estimated future cash flows consequently the assets were written down to their estimated fair values which were determined using discounted cash flow models 

net financing costs 

 

 2013 vs 2012 net financing costs increased primarily due to additional debt borrowings and associated fees partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates and higher capitalized interest borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow and to provide funding for our planned eagle ford shale acquisition that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 

  

2012 vs 2011 net financing costs increased primarily due to additional debt borrowings and lower capitalized interest partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow and divestiture proceeds 

restructuring costs 

 

  

 office consolidation 

in october 2012 we announced plans to consolidate our us personnel into a single operations group centrally located at our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city as a result we closed our office in houston transferred operational responsibilities for assets in south texas east texas and louisiana to oklahoma city and incurred 134 million of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation 

employee severance and retention – as of december 31 2013 we had incurred 90 million of employee severance and retention costs associated with the office consolidation this included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of sharebased grants 

lease obligations and other – as of december 31 2013 we had incurred 28 million of restructuring costs related to certain office space that is subject to noncancellable operating lease agreements and that we ceased using as a part of the office consolidation our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases these estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases 

divestiture of offshore assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we announced plans to divest our offshore assets as of december 31 2012 we had divested all of our us offshore and international assets and incurred 196 million of restructuring costs associated with the divestitures 

  

income taxes 

the following table presents our total income tax expense benefit and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the united states statutory income tax rate 

 

 pursuant to the completed and planned divestitures of our international assets located outside north america a portion of our foreign earnings had been deemed to no longer be indefinitely reinvested as of december 31 2012 we had recognized a 936 million deferred income tax liability related to assumed repatriations of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries including 725 million of deferred income tax expense recognized in 2011 

in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 we repatriated to the u s a total of 43 billion of our cash held outside of the u s in the fourth quarter of 2013 we announced plans to divest of our canadian noncore properties these events resulted in incremental income tax expense of 97 million the incremental expense included 180 million of current income tax expense offset by 83 million of deferred income tax benefit the 83 million deferred tax benefit was comprised of 180 million of deferred tax benefits that offset the incremental current income tax expense and an additional 97 million of deferred income tax expense accrued in the fourth quarter for assumed repatriations 

in 2013 our state income tax rate is higher than 2012 and 2011 primarily due to the relatively small amount of pretax income resulting from pretax income for the us partially offset by a pretax loss for canada also in the table above the “other” effect is primarily comprised of permanent tax differences for which the dollar amounts do not increase or decrease as our pretax earnings do generally such items typically have an insignificant impact on our effective income tax rate however these items have a more noticeable impact to our rate for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively because of the relatively small pretax incomeloss for those periods for 2013 “other” was comprised primarily of tax audit adjustments and a favorable tax impact due to acquisition financing 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

 

   

the earnings loss in each period were primarily driven by gains losses on the sales of our oil and gas assets in each period in 2012 we incurred a loss of 16 million 21 million net of taxes for the sale of our assets in angola in 2011 we generated a gain of 25 billion 25 billion net of taxes for the sale of our assets in brazil 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

 operating cash flow – continuing operations 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2013 our operating cash flow increased 10 percent during 2013 primarily due to higher commodity prices and production growth partially offset by higher expenses our operating cash flow decreased 21 percent during 2012 primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher expenses partially offset by additional cash flow from our production growth and higher cash settlements from our commodity derivatives 

during 2013 our operating cash flow funded approximately 80 percent of our cash payments for capital expenditures leveraging our liquidity we used cash balances shortterm debt and divestiture proceeds to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures 

capital expenditures 

 

   

our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties which totaled 60 billion 74 billion and 69 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 20 percent decline in exploration development and acquisition capital spending in 2013 was primarily due to a decline in new venture acreage acquisitions and utilization of the drilling carries in 2013 from our sinopec and sumitomo joint venture arrangements the higher exploration and development capital spending in 2012 and 2011 was primarily due to new venture acreage acquisitions and increased drilling and development with rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures we increased our onshore north american acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive nearterm growth of our oil production 

capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas gathering systems and oil pipelines our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities the higher 2013 midstream expenditures primarily relate to expansions of our plants serving the barnett shale and canawoodford shale and our access pipeline transporting heavy oil in canada 

capital expenditures related to other activities decreased in 2013 this decrease is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city which was completed in 2012 

debt activity net 

during 2013 we increased our debt borrowings by 361 million as a result of issuing 225 billion of debt related to the planned eagle ford shale acquisition which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 and repaying approximately 19 billion of outstanding shortterm debt 

in december 2013 to provide funding for our planned eagle ford shale acquisition we issued 225 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate senior notes resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 22 billion net of discounts and issuance costs 

during 2012 we increased our debt borrowings by 19 billion as a result of issuing 25 billion of longterm debt and repaying approximately 06 billion of outstanding shortterm debt the additional borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow 

during 2011 we increased our commercial paper borrowings by 37 billion and received 05 billion from new debt issuances net of debt maturities proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in excess of operating cash flow 

shareholder distributions 

the following table summarizes our share repurchases and our common stock dividends amounts and shares in millions 

 

 in connection with our offshore divestitures we conducted a 35 billion share repurchase program that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the program we repurchased 492 million shares representing 11 percent of our outstanding shares at an average price of 7118 per share 

  

divestitures of property and equipment 

in 2013 we sold our thunder creek operations in wyoming for approximately 148 million and our bear paw basin assets in havre montana for approximately 73 million we also sold other minor oil and gas assets 

during 2012 we closed joint venture transactions with sinopec and sumitomo sinopec paid approximately 900 million in cash and received a 333 percent interest in five of our new ventures exploration plays in the us sinopec is also funding approximately 16 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays sumitomo paid approximately 400 million and received a 30 percent interest in the cline and midlandwolfcamp shale plays in texas additionally sumitomo is funding approximately 10 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays 

also in 2012 we sold our west johnson county plant and gathering system in north texas for approximately 90 million and divested our angola operations for approximately 71 million 

in 2011 our divestitures primarily related to the divestitures of our offshore assets 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances other available sources of capital and liquidity include debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section including our planned 6 billion acquisition of eagle ford shale assets from geosouthern 

operating cash flow and cash balances 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce due to higher commodity prices our operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 10 percent to 54 billion in 2013 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2014 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various derivative financial instruments to set minimum prices on our future production the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2013 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also generally true during periods of depressed commodity prices or reduced activity 

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2013 we had total debt of 120 billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 41 percent 

  

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate additionally we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

as recent years indicate we have a history of investing more than 100 percent of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make 

at the end of 2013 we held approximately 61 billion of cash included in this total was 18 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries we would recognize and pay current income taxes in accordance with current u s tax law the payment of such additional income tax would materially decrease the amount of cash and shortterm investments ultimately available to fund our business 

credit availability 

we have a 30 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” that matures on october 24 2018 amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2013 we had 29 billion of available capacity under our syndicated unsecured senior credit facility net of letters of credit outstanding 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 percent the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2013 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 257 percent 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

we also have access to 30 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2013 we had 13 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

  

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by fitch bbb with a negative outlook by standard  poor’s and baa1 with a review for downgrade by moody’s 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our debt contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 1125 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 125 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future 

capital expenditures 

excluding our planned 6 billion eagle ford shale acquisition our 2014 capital expenditures are expected to range from 64 billion to 69 billion including 54 billion to 58 billion for our oil and gas operations which include capitalized ga and interest to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2014 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2014 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2014 our existing commodity hedging contracts available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2014 capital expenditures 

additionally our financial and operational flexibility has been further enhanced by the joint venture transactions that we entered into in 2012 with sinopec and sumitomo pursuant to the joint venture agreements sinopec and sumitomo are subject to drilling carries with remaining commitments that totaled 14 billion at the end of 2013 these drilling carries will fund 70 percent of our capital requirements related to joint venture properties which results in our partners paying approximately 80 percent of the overall development costs during the carry period this is allowing us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of the joint venture properties without diverting capital from our core development projects we expect the remaining carries will be realized by the end of 2015 

acquisitions and divestitures 

geosouthern acquisition – on november 20 2013 we entered into an agreement with geosouthern intermediate holdings llc to acquire certain oil and gas properties leasehold mineral interests and related assets located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 6 billion in cash the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 

to provide funding for the eagle ford shale acquisition we issued 225 billion of senior notes in december 2013 the floating rate senior notes due in 2015 bear interest at a rate equal to threemonth libor plus 045 which rate will be reset quarterly the floating rate senior notes due in 2016 bear interest at a rate equal to threemonth libor plus 054 which rate will be reset quarterly we also entered into a term loan agreement in december 2013 with a group of major financial institutions pursuant to which we may draw up to 20 billion to finance in part the eagle ford shale acquisition and to pay transaction costs half of any loans under the term loan agreement will have a maturity of three years and the other half will have a maturity of five years the 5year loans the 5year loans will provide for the partial amortization of principal during the last 

  

two years that they are outstanding loans borrowed under the term loan agreement may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods up to six months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate 

in the event that the eagle ford shale acquisition is not completed on or prior to june 30 2014 we will be required to redeem each series of new senior notes at 101 of the 225 billion aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

crosstex merger – on october 21 2013 devon crosstex energy inc and crosstex energy lp collectively “crosstex” announced plans to combine substantially all of devon’s us midstream assets with crosstex’s assets to form a new midstream business the new business will consist of enlink midstream partners lp the “partnership” and enlink midstream llc “enlink” a master limited partnership and a general partner entity which will both be publicly traded entities 

in exchange for a controlling interest in both enlink and the partnership devon will contribute its equity interest in a newly formed devon subsidiary “enlink holdings” and 100 million in cash enlink holdings will own devon’s midstream assets in the barnett shale in north texas and the cana and arkoma woodford shales in oklahoma as well as devon’s economic interest in gulf coast fractionators in mt belvieu texas the partnership and enlink will each own 50 of enlink holdings the completion of these transactions is subject to crosstex energy inc shareholder approval devon expects crosstex energy inc shareholders will approve the transaction allowing devon and crosstex to complete the transaction near the end of the first quarter of 2014 

upon closing of the transactions the pro forma ownership of enlink will be approximately 

 

  

 upon closing of the transactions the pro forma ownership of the partnership will be approximately 

 

  

  

 asset divestitures – in conjunction with the announcement of the eagle ford shale acquisition we also announced plans to monetize certain noncore assets located throughout canada and the u s the divestitures will likely occur in a number of separate transactions but we expect to complete the majority of the divestitures by the end of 2014 

  

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 is provided in the following table 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 contingencies and legal matters 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 18 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 

  

united states of america requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by outside petroleum consultants in 2013 91 percent of our reserves were subjected to such audits 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than two percent of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such rules also dictate that a 10 percent discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 percent discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition due to the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

derivative financial instruments 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production to hedge future prices received our commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options 

  

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using united states treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of our interest rate swaps we generally receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount as of december 31 2013 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest rate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates under the terms of our foreign exchange forward contracts we generally receive us dollars and pay canadian dollars based on a total notional amount 

we estimate the fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward exchange rates the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our observation of forward foreign exchange rates the resulting future cash inflows or outflows at maturity of the contracts are discounted using treasury rates these discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties 

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with fourteen separate counterparties and our foreign exchange forward contracts are held with four separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding 

  

the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

goodwill 

the annual impairment test which we conduct as of october 31 each year includes an assessment of qualitative factors and requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill impairment test the most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment we develop estimated fair values of our property and equipment by performing various quantitative analyses using information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

in our comparable companies analysis we review the stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that are comparable to our respective reporting units such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of the operations in our comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently in our premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently we then review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the median premiums paid 

we then use the comparable company multiples comparable transaction multiples transaction premiums and other data to develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment we also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting units at october 31 2013 the date of our last impairment test the fair values of our us and canadian reporting units exceeded their related carrying values the fair value of our us reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value however the fair value of our canadian reporting is not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of october 31 2013 the fair value of our canadian reporting unit derived by the average of our three valuation methods comparable company multiples comparable transaction multiples and transaction premiums exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11 percent as of december 31 2013 we had 28 billion of goodwill allocated to the canadian reporting unit 

significant decreases to our stock price decreases in commodity prices negative deviations from projected canadian reporting unit earnings or unfavorable changes in reserves could result in a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

  

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters 

we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these factors include forecasted and actual results for both our us and canadian operations borrowing conditions in the us and existing united states income tax laws particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and repatriations of foreign earnings changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense we accrue deferred us income tax expense on our foreign earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 

for our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax liability on these earnings calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested a hypothetical tax calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities 

 

  

  

  

 because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities it is impracticable to calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of companies 

nongaap measures 

we make reference to “adjusted earnings” and “adjusted earnings per share” in “overview of 2013 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures adjusted earnings as well as the per share amount represent net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results our nongaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure items may appear to be recurring while comparing on an annual basis in the below table restructuring costs were incurred in each of the three year periods however these costs relate to different restructuring programs amounts excluded for 2013 and a portion of 2012 relate to our office consolidation and amounts excluded for the remaining portion of 2012 and 2011 relate to our offshore divestiture program for more information on our restructuring programs see note 6 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers 

  

below are reconciliations of our adjusted earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures the reconciliations exclude amounts related to our discontinued operations 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production through various financial transactions that hedge future prices received the key terms to all our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2013 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

  

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2013 a 10 percent increase and 10 percent decrease in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts 

 

 interest rate risk 

at december 31 2013 we had total debt of 120 billion of this amount 99 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 49 percent the remaining 21 billion of debt is comprised of commercial paper borrowings that bear interest rates averaging 030 percent and floating rate debt that at december 31 2013 had rates averaging 073 percent our commercial paper borrowings typically have maturities between 1 and 90 days 

foreign currency risk 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 percent unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2013 balance sheet 

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however one of these foreign subsidiaries holds canadiandollar cash and engages in shortterm intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are based in canadian dollars the value of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash and loans into the us dollar functional currency additionally at december 31 2013 we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans the increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the us dollar equivalent of the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans based on the amount of the cash and intercompany loans as of december 31 2013 a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have materially impacted our balance sheet

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

general 

devon energy corporation “devon” is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration development and production of oil natural gas and ngls our operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the us and canada we also own natural gas pipelines plants and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas making us one of north america’s larger processors of natural gas 

devon pioneered the commercial development of natural gas from shale and coalbed formations and we are a proven leader in using steam to produce bitumen from the canadian oil sands a delaware corporation formed in 1971 we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 333 west sheridan oklahoma city ok 731025015 telephone 4052353611 as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 5700 employees 

devon files or furnishes annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k as well as any amendments to these reports with the us securities and exchange commission “sec” through our website httpwwwdevonenergycom we make available electronic copies of the documents we file or furnish to the sec the charters of the committees of our board of directors and other documents related to our corporate governance including our code of ethics for the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the sec printed copies of our committee charters or other governance documents and filings can be requested by writing to our corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this report

strategy 

we strive to maximize longterm value for our shareholders by delivering strong fullcycle margins on our assets and topquartile per share returns in pursuit of this objective we focus on growing cash flow per share adjusted for debt which has the greatest longterm correlation to share price appreciation in our industry we also focus on growth in earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we do this by 

 

  

  

  

  

 we hold 14 million net acres of which roughly twothirds are undeveloped providing us with a platform for future growth an important factor in determining the direction of our growth strategy particularly our capital allocation is the current and forecasted pricing applicable to our production our industry had been operating in an environment that had involved depressed north american gas prices contrasted with more robust prices for oil and ngls consequently with a production profile that is approximately 60 gas we have focused our recent capital programs on highermargin liquidsbased resource capture and development with recent changes in market conditions that have led to challenged prices for ngls and canadian heavy oil we are refining our capital allocations as needed and evaluating other investment opportunities to maximize and accelerate growth in cash flow per debtadjusted share 

  

oil and gas properties 

property profiles 

the locations of our key properties are presented on the following map these properties include those that currently have significant proved reserves and production as well as properties that do not currently have significant levels of proved reserves or production but are expected to be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production 

 

  

the following table outlines a summary of key data in each of our operating areas for 2012 notes 21 and 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas in the following table and throughout this report we convert our proved reserves and production to boe gas proved reserves and production are converted to boe at the rate of six mcf of gas per bbl of oil based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil bitumen and ngl proved reserves and production are converted to boe on a onetoone basis with oil 

 

 us 

barnett shale  — this is our largest property both in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas the barnett shale is a nonconventional reservoir producing natural gas ngls and condensate 

we are the largest producer in the barnett shale since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to enhance production and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in north america we have drilled in excess of 5000 wells in the barnett shale since 2002 yet we still have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 150 wells focused in the areas with the highest liquids content 

in addition we have a significant processing plant and gathering system in north texas to service these properties our bridgeport plant is one of the largest processing plants in the us currently with 650 mmcf per day of total capacity and an additional 140 mmcf expansion expected in 2013 to accommodate increasing demand from our liquidsrich drilling these midstream assets also include an extensive pipeline system and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator 

canawoodford shale  — our acreage is located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian blaine caddo and dewey counties the canawoodford shale is a nonconventional reservoir and produces natural gas ngls and condensate 

  

the canawoodford shale is a leading growth area for us and has rapidly emerged as one of the most economic shale plays in north america we are the largest leaseholder and the largest producer in the canawoodford shale during 2012 we increased our production by 45 percent we have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 150 wells 

in addition we have a significant processing plant and gathering system to service these properties our cana plant currently has 200 mmcf per day of total capacity and an additional 150 mmcf expansion expected in 2013 to accommodate increasing demand from our liquidsrich drilling 

permian basin  — our acreage is located in various counties in west texas and southeast new mexico these properties have been a legacy asset for us and continue to offer both exploration and lowrisk development opportunities we entered into a joint venture arrangement with sumitomo in 2012 covering approximately 650000 net acres in the cline shale and midlandwolfcamp shale and further strengthening the capital efficiency of our exploration programs in addition to the cline and wolfcamp shale activity our current drilling activity continues to target conventional and nonconventional oil and liquidsrich gas targets within the conventional delaware bone spring midlandwolfcamp wolfberry and avalon shale plays in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 300 wells 

gulf coasteast texas — our acreage is located primarily in harrison marion panola and shelby counties in the carthagegroesbeck areas of east texas these wells produce natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 10 wells focused in the areas with the highest liquids content 

rocky mountains — these leases are primarily concentrated in the washakie area in wyoming’s carbon and sweetwater counties the washakie wells produce natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs targeting the almond and lewis formations we have been among the most active drillers in the washakie area for many years in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 25 wells focused in the areas with the highest liquids content 

in recent years we also have acquired a significant acreage position in the dj basin this acquired acreage along with our legacy powder river basin acreage primarily targets oil in the niobrara formation these acres are principally located in eastern wyoming and are being explored using 3d seismic to identify appropriate drilling zones furthermore in early 2012 we entered into a joint venture arrangement with sinopec to explore and develop the niobrara and other new venture properties 

granite wash  — our acreage is concentrated in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma these properties produce liquids and natural gas from conventional reservoirs our legacy land position in the granite wash is held by production and provides some of the best economics in our portfolio high initial production rates and strong liquids yields contribute to the superior fullcycle rates of return in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 50 wells 

mississippian — these properties represent some of our newest assets with most of our position acquired since 2011 located in northern oklahoma and southern kansas these acres target oil in the mississippian lime and woodford shale and are being explored and developed under our joint venture arrangement with sinopec and independently by us on the acreage outside of our area of mutual interest with sinopec in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 400 wells 

canada 

canadian oil sands  — we are the first and only usbased independent energy company to develop and operate a bitumen oil sands project in canada we currently have two main projects jackfish and pike located in alberta canada 

jackfish is our thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we are employing steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the first phase of jackfish is fully operational with a 

  

gross facility capacity of 35 mbbls per day jackfish production increased 37 percent in 2012 as the second phase of jackfish which came online in the second quarter of 2011 continued to increase production construction of a third phase began in 2012 with plant startup expected by yearend 2014 we expect each phase to maintain a flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average net production rate of approximately 2530 mbbls per day 

our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the south of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2012 we filed a regulatory application in 2012 for the first phase of this project with gross capacity of 105 mbbls per day in which we hold a 50 percent interest 

to facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production we have a 50 percent interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish and eventually our pike heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale the access pipeline system is currently undergoing a capacity expansion that we anticipate will be completed in late 2014 this expansion in which we have a 50 interest is expected to create adequate capacity to transport our anticipated jackfish and pike heavy oil production to the edmonton market hub additionally it will increase the transport capacity of condensate diluent available at our thermal oil facilities 

lloydminster  — our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta and western saskatchewan lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection 

the region is welldeveloped with significant infrastructure and is primarily accessible yearround for drilling lloydminster is a lowrisk high margin oil development play we have drilled approximately 2500 wells in the area since 2003 in 2013 we plan to drill approximately 155 wells 

proved reserves 

for estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property see note 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2012 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec 

  

definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates including any or all of the following 

 

  

  

  

 the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past twelve years including the past five in his current position during his career he has been responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team in this role he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to the mobile bay norphlet discoveries gulf of mexico shelf cascade lower tertiary development gulf of mexico deepwater and polvo development campos basin brazil 

the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our vice president of budget and reserves who reports to our chief financial officer no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2012 we engaged two such firms to audit 92 percent of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited 91 percent of our 2012 us reserves and deloitte audited 93 percent of our canadian reserves 

  

“audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants at those meetings the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 production production prices and production costs 

the following table presents production price and cost information for each significant field country and continent 

 

   

 drilling statistics 

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results 

 

  

   

the following table presents the february 1 2013 results of our wells that were in progress on december 31 2012 

 

  

  productive wells 

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2012 

 

  

   the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 25000 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2012 the acreage in the table includes 14 million 08 million and 16 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 

 

  

    

title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

marketing and midstream activities 

our marketing and midstream operations provide gathering compression treating processing fractionation and marketing services to us and other thirdparties we generate revenues from these operations by collecting service fees and selling processed gas and ngls the expenses associated with these operations primarily consist of the costs to operate our gathering systems plants and related facilities as well as purchases of gas and ngls 

oil gas and ngl marketing 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil gas and ngl production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2013 our production was sold under the following contracts 

 

 delivery commitments 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of december 31 2012 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production 

 

   

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves we expect to fulfill our longerterm delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves in certain regions we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves 

our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future commitments however should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments 

customers 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 no purchaser accounted for over 10 percent of our revenues

public policy and government regulation 

the oil and natural gas industry is subject to regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations and other policy implementation actions affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations which are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes are commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations differently than they would affect other oil and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation 

our oil and gas operations are subject to federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable 

  

from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production these regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced occasionally the federal and provincial governments of canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally increase our revenues earnings and cash flow 

marketing in canada 

any oil or gas export that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

environmental and occupational regulations 

we are subject to many federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to 

 

  

  

  

  

 we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary yet manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are 

  

produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the cost to acquire properties certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our production to downstream markets such midstream systems include the systems we operate as well as systems operated by third parties when possible we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us regardless of who operates the midstream systems we 

  

rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and thirdparties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

hedging limits participation in commodity price increases and increases counterparty credit risk exposure 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

our operations are generally subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the us and canada in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which require substantial compliance costs and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing – the us department of the interior is considering the possibility of additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federal and indian lands currently regulation of hydraulic fracturing is conducted primarily at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements we lease federal and indian lands and would be affected by the interior department proposal if it were to become law 

income taxes – we are subject to federal state provincial and local income taxes and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow recently the us president and other policy makers have proposed provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws applicable to us the most significant change to our business would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs such a change could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

climate change – policymakers in the us and canada are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policymakers at both the us federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories limitations andor 

  

taxes on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives and discussions to date have focused on the development of capandtrade andor carbon tax programs a capandtrade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances capandtrade programs could be relevant to us and our operations in several ways first the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases we could therefore be subject to caps and penalties if emissions exceeded the caps second the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases therefore demand for our products could be reduced by imposition of caps and penalties on our customers carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment andor emissions resulting from use of our products by our customers of overriding significance would be the point of regulation or taxation application of caps or taxes on companies such as devon based on carbon content of produced oil and gas volumes rather than on consumer emissions could lead to penalties fees or tax assessments for which there are no mechanisms to pass them through the distribution and consumption chain where fuel use or conservation choices are made moreover because oil and natural gas are used as chemical feedstocks and not solely as fossil fuel applying a carbon tax to oil and gas at the production stage would be excessive with respect to actual carbon emissions from petroleum fuels 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

insurance does not cover all risks 

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to people or loss of life additionally for our nonoperated properties we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 percent reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk war and terrorism our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

limited control on properties operated by others 

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development 

  

of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

introduction 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview of 2012 results 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we accomplish this by executing our strategy which is outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

2012 was a year of mixed results for devon we grew our production 4 and closed two significant joint venture transactions with a combined value of approximately 40 billion furthermore with a focus on development of highermargin oil and bitumen properties in our portfolio we increased our oil and bitumen production 20 in 2012 and are positioned to deliver similar oil and bitumen growth in 2013 however this growth was overshadowed by the effects of declining commodity prices which negatively impacted a number of our 2012 financial performance measures as well as our yearend proved reserves key measures of our 2012 performance are summarized below which exclude amounts from our discontinued operations 

 

  

   our 2012 net loss resulted from noncash asset impairments which reduced our earnings by 20 billion 13 billion after tax excluding the asset impairments and other items typically excluded by securities analysts our adjusted earnings were 13 billion or 326 per diluted share this compares to adjusted earnings of 25 billion or 607 per diluted share in 2011 

  

in spite of growing our production our 2012 adjusted earnings adjusted cash flow operating margin and proved reserves declined largely due to the effects of lower commodity prices in virtually all our operating areas we realized lower prices in 2012 due to either declines in benchmarks or widening price differentials the most significant price declines were associated with our gas and ngl production for which we experienced realized price decreases of 34 and 26 respectively with increasing focus on oil and bitumen production growth which generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects we were also impacted by upward pressure on operating costs 

we replaced 152 of our 2012 production from proved reserve extensions discoveries and revisions other than price yet our proved reserves decreased 1 overall due to significant downward revisions resulting from lower gas and ngl prices 

business and industry outlook 

during 2012 natural gas traded at prices we have not experienced for a decade these low prices are the result of a significant imbalance between supply and demand in north america on the supply side new technologies particularly hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have enabled natural gas producers to bring on line meaningful new supplies of natural gas around north america on the demand side the past winter was one of the warmest on record which reduced demand for natural gas consequently north america has an unusually high amount of gas in storage that will continue to oversupply the market however there are some favorable trends utilities around the country are switching from coal to natural gas at a meaningful rate new petrochemical plants are being built and other industries are expanding in the us looking to 2013 increased demand should cause natural gas prices to stabilize or possibly to increase moderately from 2012 levels 

as a result of the low natural gas prices we and other producers have been focused on growing oil bitumen and liquidsrich gas production similar to natural gas regional imbalances between supply and demand of these liquids have caused price declines in 2012 the most negative impact to us from these imbalances related to our us ngls and our canadian heavy oil the ngl imbalances have largely resulted from increased liquidsrich gas production without corresponding increases in either ngl pipeline delivery systems or consumer demand we expect ngl prices will remain challenged for 2013 and perhaps longer due to the longlead time associated with the construction of new petrochemical capacity our canadian heavy oil production has recently been impacted by pipeline outages and refinery downtime with increasing industry heavy oil production and current pipeline capacity the pipeline outages and refinery downtimes had greater impacts to producers’ realized prices during 2012 like other producers we are beginning to use rail to deliver a portion of our heavy oil to downstream markets we are also optimistic the us government will approve construction of the keystone xl pipeline provided the pipeline outages are not recurring and industry’s planned refinery expansions occur during the first half of 2013 the downward pressures on canadian heavy oil prices should be relatively temporary in nature 

while we are optimistic about the longterm future of prices we expect benchmark prices will continue to be volatile and in some cases will be challenged in 2013 we are most optimistic about oil prices and believe our oil properties largely represent the highestreturn assets in our portfolio therefore our nearterm focus will be on these properties we also realize that we possess a great deal of financial strength flexibility and liquidity we will use these resources to develop our portfolio of properties and explore other opportunities to maximize shareholder value including monetization of our existing assets or entering into new ventures or acquisitions 

results of operations 

all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore the production revenue and expense amounts presented in this “results of operations” section exclude amounts related to our international assets unless otherwise noted 

  

even though we divested our us offshore operations in 2010 these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operating data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations to facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets where appropriate 

production prices and revenues 

 

   

  

 commodity sales 

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales 

 

 volumes 2012 vs 2011 – upstream sales increased 695 million due to a 4 percent increase in production oil and bitumen production were the largest drivers of the increase accounting for nearly 90 percent of the higher sales as a result of continued development of our liquidsrich properties in the permian basin our oil sales increased 337 million bitumen sales increased 273 million due to development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada additionally our ngl sales increased 137 million as a result of continued drilling in the liquidsrich gas portions of the barnett shale canawoodford shale and granite wash these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in our 2012 gas production resulting in a 52 million decline in sales 

  

volumes 2011 vs 2010 – upstream sales increased 458 million due to a 5 percent increase in production bitumen and ngl volume increases resulted in 340 million higher sales additional volumes for both of these products were primarily due to the same reasons discussed in our 2012 vs 2011 comparison above additionally we saw slight increases in our oil and gas volumes which resulted in 118 million higher sales 

production information for our key properties is summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 prices 2012 vs 2011 – upstream sales decreased 19 billion due to a 17 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges our gas sales were the most significantly impacted with a 11 billion decrease in sales the change in our gas price was largely due to fluctuations of the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based we also experienced declines in our ngl bitumen and oil sales due to our realized price the largest contributors to the lower liquids prices were lower ngl prices at the mont belvieu texas hub and wider bitumen differentials to the nymex west texas intermediate index price 

prices 2011 vs 2010 – upstream sales increased 595 million due to a 9 percent increase in our realized price without hedges our realized price for oil bitumen and ngls increased primarily due to an increase in the average index price for which each product is sold our realized price for gas decreased primarily due to fluctuations of the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

  

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses 

 

  

 cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments a summary of our open commodity derivative positions is included in note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars basis swaps and call options to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we sold gas call options for 2012 and 2014 and oil call options for 2011 through 2014 the call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price 

  

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives generated net gains of 693 million 881 million and 811 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

 2012 vs 2011 marketing and midstream operating profit decreased 132 million primarily due to lower natural gas and ngl prices 

2011 vs 2010 marketing and midstream operating profit increased 32 million primarily due to higher natural gas throughput and higher ngl prices 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

 2012 vs 2011 loe increased 059 per boe largely because of our oil production growth particularly at our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada and in the permian basin in the us such oil projects generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects we also experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas which increased loe per boe 

2011 vs 2010 loe increased 029 per boe loe increased 039 per boe excluding the us offshore operations that were sold in the second quarter of 2010 the largest contributor to the higher north america onshore unit cost is our oil production growth particularly at our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada we also experienced inflationary pressures on costs in certain operating areas additionally loe per boe increased 015 due to a 36 million increase from changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 

  

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

 a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 

2012 vs 2011 oil and gas property dda increased 460 million due to a 22 percent increase in the dda rate and 79 million due to our 4 percent increase in production the largest contributors to the higher rate were our 2012 drilling and development activities 

2011 vs 2010 oil and gas property dda increased 221 million due to a 13 percent increase in the dda rate and 91 million due to our 5 percent increase in production the largest contributors to the higher rate were our 2011 drilling and development activities and changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars these increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

 2012 vs 2011 net ga and net ga per boe increased largely due to higher employee compensation and benefits employee costs increased primarily from an expansion of our workforce as part of growing production operations at certain of our key areas including jackfish the permian basin and the canawoodford shale 

2011 vs 2010 net ga increased primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits while net ga per boe slightly declined as we grew production at a higher rate than ga 

  

taxes other than income taxes 

 

 2012 vs 2011 taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in our us onshore revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

2011 vs 2010 taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in our us onshore revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

interest expense 

 

 2012 vs 2011 interest expense increased primarily due to additional debt borrowings and lower capitalized interest partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow and 2012 divestiture proceeds 

2011 vs 2010 interest expense decreased primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of our 350 million notes in 2010 this was partially offset by higher interest resulting from increased debt balances in 2011 

restructuring costs 

 

  

   

office consolidation 

in october 2012 we announced plans to consolidate our us personnel into a single operations group centrally located at our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city as a result we are in the process of closing our office in houston and transferring operational responsibilities for assets in south texas east texas and louisiana to oklahoma city this initiative is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter 2013 

employee severance – in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recognized 77 million of estimated employee severance costs associated with the office consolidation this amount was based on estimates of the number employees that would ultimately be impacted by the office consolidation and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of sharebased grants 

lease obligations and other – as of december 31 2012 we incurred 3 million of restructuring costs related to certain office space that is subject to noncancellable operating lease agreements and that we ceased using as a part of the office consolidation in 2013 we expect to incur approximately 25 million of additional restructuring costs that represent the present value of our future obligations under the leases net of anticipated sublease income our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases these estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases 

divestiture of offshore assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we announced plans to divest our offshore assets as of december 31 2012 we had divested all of our us offshore and international assets and incurred 196 million of restructuring costs associated with the divestitures 

employee severance – this amount was originally based on estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the offshore divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of sharebased grants as the divestiture program progressed we decreased our overall estimate of employee severance costs more offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in our us onshore operations 

lease obligations and other – as a result of the divestitures we ceased using certain office space that was subject to noncancellable operating lease arrangements consequently in 2010 we recognized 70 million of restructuring costs that represented the present value of our future obligations under the leases net of anticipated sublease income our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases these estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases in addition we recognized 13 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space that we ceased using 

asset impairments 

 

   

oil and gas impairments 

under the fullcost method of accounting capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test which is discussed in note 1 to the financial statements under “item 8 consolidated financial statements” of this report 

the oil and gas impairments resulted primarily from declines in the us and canada full cost ceilings the lower ceiling values resulted primarily from decreases in the 12month average trailing prices for oil natural gas and ngls which have reduced proved reserve values 

if pricing conditions do not improve we may incur full cost ceiling impairments related to our oil and gas property and equipment in 2013 

midstream impairments 

due to declining natural gas production resulting from low natural gas and ngl prices we determined that the carrying amounts of certain of our midstream facilities were not recoverable from estimated future cash flows consequently the assets were written down to their estimated fair values which were determined using discounted cash flow models 

other net 

 

 2012 vs 2011 other net increased primarily due to 88 million of excess insurance recoveries received in 2011 related to certain weather and operational claims 

2011 vs 2010 other net decreased primarily due to excess insurance recoveries received in 2011 as discussed above the remainder of the variance primarily relates to the net effect of interest rate derivatives due to changes in the related interest rates upon which the instruments are based 

  

income taxes 

the following table presents our total income tax expense benefit and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate 

 

 in the table above the “other” effect is primarily comprised of permanent tax differences for which the dollar amounts do not increase or decrease as our pretax earnings do generally such items typically have an insignificant impact on our effective income tax rate however these items have a more noticeable impact to our rate for the year ended december 31 2012 because of the relatively small pretax loss for that period 

during 2011 and 2010 pursuant to the completed and planned divestitures of our international assets located outside north america a portion of our foreign earnings were no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested accordingly we recognized deferred income tax expense of 725 million and 144 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively related to assumed repatriations of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

 

 the earnings loss in each period were primarily driven by gains losses on the sales of our oil and gas assets in each period the following table presents gains and losses on our divestiture transactions by year 

 

   

capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

 operating cash flow – continuing operations 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2012 our operating cash flow decreased 21 percent during 2012 primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher expenses partially offset by additional cash flow from our production growth and higher realized gains from our commodity derivatives 

during 2012 our operating cash flow funded approximately threefourths of our cash payments for capital expenditures net of divestitures proceeds leveraging our liquidity we used debt to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures 

debt activity net 

during 2012 we increased our debt borrowings by 19 billion as a result of issuing 25 billion of longterm debt and repaying approximately 06 billion of outstanding shortterm debt the additional borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow 

during 2011 we increased our commercial paper borrowings by 37 billion and received 05 billion from new debt issuances net of debt maturities proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in excess of operating cash flow 

during 2010 we repaid 14 billion of commercial paper borrowings and redeemed our 350 million notes primarily with proceeds received from our us offshore divestitures 

divestitures of property and equipment 

during 2012 we closed joint venture transactions with sinopec and sumitomo sinopec paid approximately 900 million in cash and received a 333 percent interest in five of our new ventures exploration plays in the us sinopec is also funding approximately 16 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays sumitomo paid approximately 400 million and received a 30 percent interest in the cline and midlandwolfcamp shale plays in texas additionally sumitomo is funding approximately 10 billion of our share of future exploration development and drilling costs associated with these plays at december 31 2012 sinopec’s and sumitomo’s remaining commitment to fund our share of future costs associated with these plays was approximately 23 billion 

also in 2012 we sold our west johnson county plant and gathering system in north texas for approximately 90 million and divested our angola operations for approximately 71 million 

  

in 2011 and 2010 our divestitures primarily related to the divestitures of our offshore assets 

capital expenditures 

the amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods 

 

 our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties which totaled 73 billion 67 billion and 59 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increases in exploration and development capital spending in 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to new venture acreage acquisitions and increased drilling and development with rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures we have increased our onshore north american acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive nearterm growth of our liquids particularly oil production 

capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas gathering systems and oil pipelines our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities therefore the increase in development drilling also increased midstream capital activities 

capital expenditures related to other activities decreased in 2012 this decrease is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city being substantially complete in early 2012 

shareholder distributions 

the following table summarizes our share repurchases and our common stock dividends amounts and shares in millions 

 

 in connection with our offshore divestitures we conducted a 35 billion share repurchase program that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the program we repurchased 492 million shares representing 11 percent of our outstanding shares at an average price of 7118 per share 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow asset divestiture proceeds and cash on hand additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program 

  

which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances other available sources of capital and liquidity include debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section 

operating cash flow 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce due to lower commodity prices our operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased 21 percent to 49 billion in 2012 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

commodity prices – prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2013 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various derivative financial instruments to set minimum prices on our future production the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2012 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also generally true during periods of depressed commodity prices or reduced activity 

interest rates – our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2012 we had total debt of 116 billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 40 percent we have derivative financial instruments in place that reduce our weightedaverage interest rate to 38 percent 

credit losses – our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate additionally we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayments or collateral postings 

as recent years indicate we have a history of investing more than 100 percent of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make 

credit availability 

we have a 30 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the senior credit facility has an initial maturity date of october 24 2017 however prior to the maturity date we have the option to extend the maturity for up to two additional oneyear periods subject to the approval of the lenders 

  

amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2012 we had 29 billion of available capacity under our syndicated unsecured senior credit facility net of letters of credit outstanding 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 percent the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2012 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 254 percent 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

we also have access to 50 billion of shortterm credit under our commercial paper program commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2012 we had 32 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

at the end of 2012 we held approximately 70 billion of cash and shortterm investments included in this total was 65 billion of cash and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries we do not currently expect to repatriate the 65 billion to the us this expectation is based on planned investments to develop and grow our canadian business our current forecasts for both our us and canadian operations currently favorable borrowing conditions in the us and existing us income tax laws pertaining to repatriations of foreign earnings therefore with limited cash and shortterm investments in the us we expect to continue funding our us business with a combination of our usbased operating cash flow and borrowings we do not expect nearterm borrowing increases will have a material negative effect on our overall liquidity or financial condition 

if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries we would recognize and pay current income taxes in accordance with current us tax law the payment of such additional income tax would materially decrease the amount of cash and shortterm investments ultimately available to fund our business 

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by both fitch and standard  poor’s and baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

  

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 1125 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 125 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2012 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

capital expenditures 

our 2013 capital expenditures are expected to range from 64 billion to 70 billion including 53 billion to 58 billion for our oil and gas operations which include capitalized ga and interest to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2013 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2013 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2013 our existing commodity hedging contracts available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2013 capital expenditures 

additionally our financial and operational flexibility has been further enhanced by the joint venture transactions that we entered into in 2012 with sinopec and sumitomo pursuant to the joint venture agreements sinopec and sumitomo are subject to drilling carries with remaining commitments that totaled 23 billion at the end of 2012 these drilling carries will fund 70 percent of our capital requirements related to joint venture properties which results in our partners paying approximately 80 percent of the overall development costs during the carry period this is allowing us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of the joint venture properties without diverting capital from our core development projects we expect the remaining carries will be realized by the end of 2014 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 is provided in the following table 

 

  

    

      contingencies and legal matters 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 18 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by outside petroleum consultants in 2012 92 percent of our reserves were subjected to such audits 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than two percent of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

  

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such rules also dictate that a 10 percent discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 percent discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition due to the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

derivative financial instruments 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production to hedge future prices received our commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using us treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of our interestrate swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties 

  

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with fifteen separate counterparties and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with four separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

goodwill 

the annual impairment test which we conduct as of october 31 each year includes an assessment of qualitative factors and requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill impairment test the most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment we develop estimated fair values of our property and equipment by performing various quantitative analyses using information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

in our comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that are comparable to our respective reporting units such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of the operations in our comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently in our premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently we then review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the median premiums paid 

we then use the comparable company multiples comparable transaction multiples transaction premiums and other data to develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment we also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting units at october 31 2012 the date of our last impairment test the fair values of our us and canadian reporting units exceeded their related carrying values 

a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast could result in a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

  

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters 

nongaap measures 

we make reference to “adjusted earnings” “adjusted earnings per share” and “adjusted cash flow” in “overview of 2012 results” in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures adjusted earnings represents net earnings excluding certain noncash or nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results adjusted cash flow represents cash flow from operating activities excluding certain balance sheet changes and nonrecurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results we believe these nongaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings and cash flow estimates published by securities analysts we also believe these nongaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers the tables below exclude amounts related to our discontinued operations 

adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

below are reconciliations of our adjusted earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures 

 

   

 adjusted cash flow

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production through various 

  

financial transactions that hedge future prices received the key terms to all our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2012 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2012 a 10 percent increase and 10 percent decrease in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts 

 

 interest rate risk 

at december 31 2012 we had total debt of 116 billion our longterm debt of 84 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 54 percent the remaining 32 billion of commercial paper borrowings bears interest at fixed rates which averaged 037 percent our commercial paper borrowings typically have maturity rates between 1 and 90 days 

as of december 31 2012 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the federal funds rate a 10 percent change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet at december 31 2012 

foreign currency risk 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 percent unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2012 balance sheet 

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however one of these foreign subsidiaries holds canadiandollar cash and engages in shortterm intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are sometimes based in canadian dollars additionally at december 31 2012 we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the canadiandollar cash and intercompany loans the increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the us dollar equivalent of the canadiandollar cash the value of the intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the loans into the us dollar functional currency based on the amount of the intercompany loans as of december 31 2012 a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not materially impact our balance sheet

strategy 

we aspire to be the premier independent oil and natural gas company in north america and to provide our shareholders with topquartile returns over the longterm to achieve this we strive to optimize our capital investments to maximize growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we do this by 

 

  

  

  

 growth in cash flow per debtadjusted share has the greatest longterm correlation to share price appreciation as a result we focus on capital investments that sustain and accelerate growth per debtadjusted share in an environment that involves challenged natural gas prices and more robust liquids prices our capital allocation is focused on liquidsbased resource capture and development our portfolio strikes a good balance between oil ngls and natural gas with a cost structure that generates highly competitive fullcycle returns within our portfolio we have a deep inventory of repeatable opportunities diversified across several key resource plays we also have significant exposure to several emerging plays and new venture opportunities finally the recent divestiture of our offshore operations generated about 8 billion in aftertax proceeds we used a portion of these proceeds to repurchase 35 billion of our common stock and repay debt giving us one of the strongest balance sheets in our peer group 

  

oil and gas properties 

property profiles 

the locations of our key properties are presented on the following map these properties include those that currently have significant proved reserves and production as well as properties that do not currently have significant levels of proved reserves or production but are expected to be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production 

 

  

the following table outlines a summary of key data in each of our operating areas for 2011 notes 21 and 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain additional information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

  

 nm not meaningful 

us 

barnett shale  — this is our largest property both in terms of production and proved reserves our leases are located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties in north texas the barnett shale is a nonconventional reservoir producing natural gas and ngls 

we are the largest producer in the barnett shale since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002 we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to enhance production and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in north america we have drilled nearly 5000 wells in the barnett shale since 2002 yet we still have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 300 wells 

in addition we have a significant processing plant and gathering system in north texas to service these properties currently these midstream assets include over 3000 miles of pipeline two natural gas processing plants with 750 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator to meet increasing demand from our liquidsrich development drilling we intend to increase the size of our inlet processing capacity to 890 mmcf per day by early 2013 

  

canawoodford shale  — our acreage is located primarily in oklahoma’s canadian blaine caddo and dewey counties the canawoodford shale is a nonconventional reservoir and produces natural gas ngls and condensate 

the canawoodford is a leading growth area for devon and has rapidly emerged as one of the most economic shale plays in north america we are the largest leaseholder and the largest producer in the canawoodford during 2011 we increased our production by 85 we have several thousand remaining drilling locations in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 200 wells 

in addition we have constructed a gas processing plant with 200 mmcf per day of total capacity to meet increasing demand from our development drilling we intend to increase the size of our plant to 350 mmcf per day by mid2013 

permian basin  — these properties have been a legacy asset for us and continue to offer both exploration and lowrisk development opportunities our acreage is located in various counties in west texas and southeast new mexico our current drilling activity is targeting conventional and nonconventional liquidsrich targets within the conventional delaware bone spring wolfcamp wolfberry and avalon shale plays in 2012 we plan to drill more than 300 wells 

carthage  — our acreage is located primarily in harrison marion panola and shelby counties in east texas these wells produce natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 35 wells 

washakie  — these leases are concentrated in wyoming’s carbon and sweetwater counties the washakie wells produce natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs targeting the almond and lewis formations we have been among the most active drillers in the washakie basin for many years 

granite wash  — our acreage is concentrated in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma these properties produce liquids and natural gas from conventional reservoirs our legacy land position in the granite wash is held by production and provides some of the best economics in our portfolio high initial production rates and strong liquids yields contribute to the superior fullcycle rates of return in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 65 wells 

arkomawoodford shale  — our acreage is located primarily in coal and hughes counties in southeastern oklahoma these properties produce natural gas and ngls from a nonconventional reservoir our acreage in this play is held by production in 2012 we do not plan to drill additional wells 

new ventures  — during 2010 and 2011 we made significant acreage acquisitions targeting liquids rich production including the following five exploration opportunities that we have publicly disclosed 

 

  

  

  

  

   

additionally in the first quarter of 2012 we expect to close our recently announced transaction in which our new partner will obtain a 333 interest in these new ventures properties for approximately 25 billion including a 900 million payment at closing and 16 billion toward our share of future drilling costs we will continue to derisk the development of these properties with our partner by drilling approximately 125 wells in 2012 

canada 

jackfish  — jackfish is our thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we are the first and only usbased independent energy company to develop and operate an oil sands project in canada we are employing steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish the first phase of jackfish is fully operational with a gross facility capacity of 35 mbbls per day the second phase of jackfish began production in the second quarter of 2011 and will continue to increase production throughout 2012 also in 2011 we received regulatory approval for the construction of a third phase and will begin construction in 2012 we expect each phase to maintain a flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average net production rate of approximately 2530 mbbls per day 

to facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production we have a 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale 

northwest  — this region includes acreage in west central alberta and northeast british columbia these properties produce liquidsrich natural gas and light gravity oil from conventional reservoirs in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 25 wells 

the region includes both winteronly and all season access areas multizone drilling opportunities are common since initial exploration in the 1970s the region has seen significant infrastructure expansion we own and operate gas gathering and processing facilities in the area enabling projects to be brought onstream quickly 

deep basin  — our properties in canada’s deep basin include portions of west central alberta and east central british columbia the area produces natural gas and liquids from conventional reservoirs in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 15 wells 

we are one of the major producers in the deep basin we have used our large proprietary twodimensional and threedimensional seismic databases to build an extensive inventory of deep to midrange drilling targets in this area most recently we have been testing light oil targets in the cardium formation and liquidsrich opportunities in the lower cretaceous zones including the cadomin the region has winteronly access restrictions in many areas but offers yearround access in others we control significant gas processing and transportation infrastructure throughout the region and hold interests in the only major gas facilities in the wapiti area 

lloydminster  — our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta and western saskatchewan lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without the need for steam injection in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 150 wells 

the region is welldeveloped with significant infrastructure and is primarily accessible yearround for drilling lloydminster is a lowrisk high margin oil development play we have drilled over 2300 wells in the area since 2003 

pike  — our pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the south of our jackfish acreage in east central alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to jackfish the pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of december 31 2011 we continued appraisal drilling in 2011 and will carry forward these activities into 2012 the results will help us determine the optimal configuration for the initial phase of development 

  

proved reserves 

for estimates of our proved proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property see note 22 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2011 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates including any or all of the following 

 

  

  

  

 the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the us both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past eleven years including the past four in his current position during his career with devon and others he was responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team in this role he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to the mobile bay norphlet discoveries gulf of mexico shelf cascade lower tertiary development gulf of mexico deepwater and polvo development campos basin brazil 

the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our vice president of budget and reserves who reports to our chief financial officer no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2011 we engaged two such firms to audit 95 of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2011 reserve estimates for 97 of our us onshore properties ajm deloitte audited 89 of our canadian reserves 

“audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants at those meetings the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

production production prices and production costs 

the following table presents production price and cost information for each significant field country and continent 

 

  

 drilling statistics 

the following table summarizes our development and exploratory drilling results 

 

  

   

the following table presents the february 1 2012 results of our wells that were in progress on december 31 2011 

 

  

  

 productive wells 

the following table sets forth our producing wells as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  

 the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions we are the operator of approximately 24000 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

acreage statistics 

the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2011 the acreage in the table includes 06 million 12 million and 05 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively 

 

  

  

   

title to properties 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

marketing and midstream activities 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil gas and ngl production timely and efficiently 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

 our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

  

  

  

  

 oil gas and ngl marketing 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further information 

as of january 2012 our production was sold under the following contracts 

 

   

delivery commitments 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity as of january 2012 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production 

 

  

 we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves we expect to fulfill our longerterm delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves in certain regions we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves 

our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future commitments however should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments 

customers 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues 

competition 

see “item 1a risk factors” 

public policy and government regulation 

the oil and natural gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations and other policy implementations affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to public policy changes numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes affecting the oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations 

exploration and production regulation 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include but are not limited to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the us some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

royalties and incentives in canada 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays tax credits and fixed rate and profitsharing royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

pricing and marketing in canada 

any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

  

environmental and occupational regulations 

we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

 we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

discoveries or acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

  

competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the cost to acquire properties certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our production to downstream markets such midstream systems include the systems we operate as well as systems operated by third parties when possible we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and thirdparties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

hedging limits participation in commodity price increases and increases counterparty credit risk exposure 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

our operations are generally subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the us and canada in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

  

hydraulic fracturing — the us department of the interior is considering the possibility of additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands currently regulation of hydraulic fracturing is conducted primarily at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements we lease federal lands and would be affected by the interior department proposal if it were to become law 

income taxes — we are subject to federal state provincial and local income taxes and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax the types costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow the us president’s budget proposals include provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws the most significant change to our business would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs 

climate change — policy makers in the us are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policy makers at both the us federal and state level have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development of capandtrade programs these programs generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances capandtrade programs would be relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases additionally the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

insurance does not cover all risks 

our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration development production processing and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls such risks include potential blowouts cratering fires loss of well control mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals the occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution damage to or destruction of our property equipment and natural resources injury to person or loss of life additionally for our nonoperated properties we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance 

to mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages loss of well control business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental we also maintain worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance however our insurance coverage does not provide 100 reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards additionally insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual and we have 

  

limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk war and terrorism our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and liquidity 

limited control on properties operated by others 

certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve thirdparty working interest owners we have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties including compliance with environmental health and safety regulations or the amount of required future capital expenditures these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend introduction 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview of business 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flows earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we accomplish this by executing our strategy which is outlined in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

overview of 2011 results 

2011 was an outstanding year for devon we generated record net earnings increased proved reserves to an alltime high and completed our highly successful strategic repositioning transforming us into a pure north american onshore company we have now essentially completed our offshore divestiture program in aggregate the divestiture program generated aftertax proceeds of approximately 8 billion assuming the repatriation of a substantial portion of the foreign proceeds under current us tax law we also completed our 35 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2011 

as we have increased our focus on the vast opportunities in our north american onshore portfolio of properties we are seeing improvements in key measures of our performance including growth in liquids 

  

production and cash flow both on a per share debtadjusted basis which is key to maximizing shareholder value key measures of our 2011 production performance as well as certain other financial measures and operational developments are summarized below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fourth quarter operational developments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 business and industry outlook 

we possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility and are fully committed to exercising capital discipline maximizing profits maintaining balance sheet strength and optimizing growth per debtadjusted share our portfolio of assets provides a great deal of investment flexibility we expect gas prices will remain challenged in the market throughout 2012 therefore our nearterm focus is on the oil and liquidsrich opportunities that exist within our balanced portfolio of properties the vast majority of our 2012 drilling activity will be centered on our oil and liquidsrich gas properties should the outlook for commodity prices change we have the flexibility to redirect our capital to ensure we continually focus on the highestreturn assets in our portfolio 

additionally our financial and operational flexibility will be further enhanced by the transaction that we announced in early 2012 with sinopec international petroleum exploration  production corporation which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2012 pursuant to the terms of the agreement sinopec will pay 25 billion including a 900 million payment at closing and 16 billion toward our share of future drilling costs and will receive a 333 interest in five of our new venture plays 

our ability to leverage the depth and breadth of our existing portfolio of properties will be important to successfully achieve our growth and valuecreation objectives with 3005 mmboe of proved reserves at the end of 2011 our assets will provide many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas in 2012 we are targeting a 6 percent production increase which will be fueled by liquids growth approaching 20 

results of operations 

all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore the production revenue and expense amounts presented in this “results of operations” section exclude amounts related to our international assets unless otherwise noted 

even though we divested our us offshore operations in 2010 these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operating data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations to facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets where appropriate 

  

production prices and revenues 

 

  

  

   

 

  

 the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales 

 

 oil sales 

2011 vs 2010 oil sales increased 488 million in 2011 as a result of a 17 percent increase in our realized price without hedges the largest contributor to the higher realized price was an increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate price 

oil sales increased 268 million due to a 10 percent increase in production the increase in production was driven by the continued development of our permian basin properties and our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada this increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 

  

2010 vs 2009 oil sales increased 557 million as a result of a 27 percent increase in our realized price without hedges the largest contributor to the higher realized price was an increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price 

oil sales decreased 67 million due to a 3 percent production decline the decrease was comprised of the net effects of a 62 percent decrease in our us offshore production and a 5 percent increase in our north america onshore production the decrease in our us offshore production was primarily due to the divestiture of such properties in the second quarter of 2010 the increased north america onshore production resulted primarily from continued development of our permian basin properties and our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in canada 

gas sales 

2011 vs 2010 gas sales decreased 249 million in 2011 as a result of a 7 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges the change in price was largely due to fluctuations of the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

gas sales increased 88 million due to a 2 percent increase in production the increased production resulted primarily from continued development activities in the barnett and canawoodford shales partially offset by natural declines in our other operating areas this increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 

2010 vs 2009 gas sales increased 497 million as a result of a 16 percent increase in our realized price without hedges this increase was largely due to higher north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

gas sales decreased 122 million due to a 4 percent decrease in production the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 also our north american onshore properties decreased 1 percent due to reduced drilling during most of 2009 in response to lower gas prices 

ngl sales 

2011 vs 2010 ngl sales increased 311 million in 2011 due to a 26 percent increase in our realized price without hedges the higher price was largely due to an increase in the mont belvieu texas hub price 

ngl sales increased 147 million in 2011 due to a 14 percent increase in production the increased production was primarily due to increased drilling in our barnett shale canawoodford shale and granite wash locations 

2010 vs 2009 ngl sales increased 254 million in 2010 as a result of a 32 percent increase in our realized price the higher price was largely due to an increase in the mont belvieu texas hub price 

ngl sales increased 46 million in 2010 due to a 6 percent increase in production the increase in production was primarily due to increased drilling in our north american onshore areas that have liquidsrich gas 

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues 

  

the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses 

 

  

  

  

 a summary of our outstanding commodity derivatives is included in note 2 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars and basis swaps for the price swaps we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty the price collars set a floor and ceiling price if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we cashsettle the difference with the counterparty to the collars for the basis swaps we receive a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments 

  

also to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012 the call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price 

in addition to cash settlements we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period the changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives generated net gains of 881 million 811 million and 384 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 marketing and midstream operating profit increased 32 million primarily due to higher gas throughput and higher ngl prices 

2010 vs 2009 marketing and midstream operating profit decreased 2 million primarily due to higher natural gas and ngl prices partially offset by the effects of lower gas marketing profits 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 loe increased 029 per boe in 2011 loe increased 039 per boe excluding the us offshore operations that were sold in the second quarter of 2010 the largest contributor to the higher north america onshore unit cost is our oil production growth particularly at our jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in 

  

canada such oil projects generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects we also experienced upward pressures on costs in certain operating areas which increased loe per boe additionally loe per boe increased 015 due to a 36 million increase from changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 

2010 vs 2009 loe increased 026 per boe in 2010 loe increased 045 per boe excluding costs associated with our us offshore operations loe per boe increased 034 due to a 78 million increase from changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars the remainder of the increase in north america onshore loe per boe was primarily due to increased costs related to our jackfish operation in canada 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

  

 a description of how dda of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in note 1 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 

2011 vs 2010 oil and gas property dda increased 221 million during 2011 due to a 13 percent increase in the dda rate and 91 million due to our 5 percent increase in production the largest contributors to the higher rate were our 2011 drilling and development activities and changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars these increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 

2010 vs 2009 oil and gas property dda decreased 114 million during 2010 due to a 6 percent decrease in the dda rate and 43 million due to our 2 percent decline in production the largest contributors to the rate decrease were our 2010 us offshore property divestitures and a 64 billion reduction of the carrying value of our us oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 these decreases were partially offset by the effects of costs incurred and transfers of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of our 2010 drilling and development activities as well as changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 

  

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

  

 2011 vs 2010 net ga increased during 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits while net ga per boe slightly declined as we grew production at a higher rate than ga 

2010 vs 2009 net ga on an absolute and per boe basis decreased largely due to a decline in employee severance costs such costs decreased primarily due to employees that were impacted by the integration of our offshore operations into one unit in 2009 in addition net ga decreased subsequent to our midyear 2010 offshore divestitures as a result of the decline in our workforce 

taxes other than income taxes 

 

  

 taxes other than income taxes increased in each period primarily due to an increase in our us onshore revenues on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed 

interest expense 

 

   

2011 vs 2010 interest expense decreased primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of our 350 million notes in 2010 this was partially offset by higher interest resulting from increased debt balances in 2011 

2010 vs 2009 interest expense increased due to costs associated with the early retirement of debt discussed above and a decrease in our capitalized interest the decrease in capitalized interest resulted primarily from the divestiture of our us offshore properties in 2010 these increases were partially offset by lower interest on our debt balances resulting from the retirement of 350 million of notes in 2010 and 177 million of notes in 2009 

restructuring costs 

 

  

 in the fourth quarter of 2009 we announced plans to divest our offshore assets as of december 31 2011 we had divested all of our us offshore assets and substantially all of our international assets through the end of 2011 we had incurred 202 million of restructuring costs associated with these divestitures 

employee severance 

this amount was originally based on estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the offshore divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of sharebased grants as the divestiture program progressed we decreased our overall estimate of employee severance costs more offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in our us onshore operations 

lease obligations 

as a result of the divestitures we ceased using certain office space that was subject to noncancellable operating lease arrangements consequently in 2010 we recognized 70 million of restructuring costs that represented the present value of our future obligations under the leases net of anticipated sublease income our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases these estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases 

in addition we recognized 11 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space that we ceased using 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

in the first quarter of 2009 we reduced the carrying value of our us oil and gas properties 64 billion or 41 billion after taxes due to a full cost ceiling limitation the lower ceiling value largely resulted from the 

  

effects of declining natural gas prices subsequent to december 31 2008 to demonstrate the decline the march 31 2009 and december 31 2008 weighted average wellhead prices are presented in the following table 

 

 the march 31 2009 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4966 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 363 per mmbtu for gas the december 31 2008 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4460 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 571 per mmbtu for gas 

other net 

 

 2011 vs 2010 other net decreased primarily due to 88 million of excess insurance recoveries received in 2011 related to certain weather and operational claims the remainder of the variance primarily relates to the net effect of interest rate swap cash settlements and unrealized fair value changes due to changes in the related interest rates upon which the instruments are based 

2010 vs 2009 other net increased primarily due to the reversal of a 84 million loss contingency accrual in 2009 we had previously accrued 84 million for potential royalties on various deep water leases but due to a federal district court ruling we reversed the accrual in 2009 the remainder of the variance primarily relates to the net effect of interest rate swap cash settlements and unrealized fair value changes due to changes in the related interest rates upon which the instruments are based 

income taxes 

the following table presents our total income tax expense benefit and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate 

 

   

during 2011 2010 and 2009 pursuant to the completed and planned divestitures of our international assets located outside north america a portion of our foreign earnings were no longer deemed to be permanently reinvested accordingly we recognized deferred income tax expense of 725 million 144 million and 55 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively related to assumed repatriations of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 

earnings from discontinued operations 

 

 the earnings in each period were primarily driven by gains on the sales of our oil and gas assets in each period the following table presents gains on our divestiture transactions by year also in 2009 we reduced the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in brazil by 109 million due to full cost ceiling limitation resulting from drilling results at the bmbar3 offshore block 

 

 capital resources uses and liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents the major source and use categories of our cash and cash equivalents 

 

   

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2011 our operating cash flow increased 24 percent in spite of the 454 million of discretionary contributions made to our pension plans in 2011 the increase was largely due to higher current income taxes in 2010 associated with taxable gains on our us offshore divestitures and higher commodity prices and production partially offset by lower realized gains from our commodity derivatives 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 our operating cash flow funded 83 78 and 87 of our cash payments for capital expenditures as needed we supplement our operating cash flow and available cash by reducing shortterm investment balances or accessing available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program we may also issue longterm debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities additionally we may acquire shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances 

debt activity net 

during 2011 we increased our commercial paper borrowings by 37 billion and received 05 billion from new debt issuances net of debt maturities proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in excess of operating cash flow 

during 2010 we repaid 14 billion of commercial paper borrowings and redeemed our 350 million notes primarily with proceeds received from our us offshore divestitures 

during 2009 we increased our commercial paper borrowings by 400 million and our term debt 10 billion net of maturities these proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow 

divestitures of property and equipment 

the following table presents the components of our divestiture transactions 

 

   

capital expenditures 

the amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods 

 

 our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties which totaled 67 billion 59 billion and 43 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increases in exploration and development capital spending in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to new venture acreage acquisitions the 2010 500 million pike oil sands acquisition and increased drilling and development with rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures we have increased our acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive nearterm growth of our onshore liquids production 

the increase in north american onshore exploration and development capital spending in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the 500 million pike oil sands acquisition and increased drilling primarily to grow liquids production 

capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities therefore the increase in development drilling also increased midstream capital activities 

capital expenditures related to other activities increased in 2011 this increase is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city 

common stock repurchases and dividends 

the following table summarizes our repurchases including unsettled shares and our common stock dividends amounts and shares in millions 

 

 in connection with our offshore divestitures we conducted a 35 billion share repurchase program that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the program we repurchased 492 million shares representing 11 of our outstanding shares at an average price of 7118 per share 

  

shortterm investment activity net 

during 2011 we had net shortterm investment purchases totaling 13 billion these purchases represent our investment of a portion of the international offshore divestiture proceeds into commercial paper us and canadian treasury securities and other marketable securities 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow and cash on hand additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances other available sources of capital and liquidity include debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the sec we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section 

operating cash flow 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil gas and ngls we produce due to higher liquids production and prices our operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 24 percent to 62 billion in 2011 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

commodity prices — prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in prices and are beyond our control we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2012 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various derivative financial instruments to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2012 production the key terms to our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2011 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices 

interest rates — our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2011 we had total debt of 98 billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 40 percent we have derivative financial instruments in place that reduce our weightedaverage interest rate to 37 percent 

credit losses — our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate additionally we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions requiring letters of credit prepayment requirements or collateral posting requirements 

as 2011 2010 and 2009 demonstrate we have a history of investing more than 100 of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders therefore negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make 

  

credit availability 

we have a 265 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” that can be accessed to provide liquidity as needed the maturity date for 219 billion of the senior credit facility is april 7 2013 the maturity date for the remaining 046 billion is april 7 2012 all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders the senior credit facility includes a revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 05 billion 

amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of february 9 2012 we had 18 billion of available capacity under our syndicated unsecured senior credit facility 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 percent the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2011 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 228 percent 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program in 2011 we increased our commercial paper program from 22 billion to 50 billion commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market as of february 9 2012 we had 31 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program 

although we ended 2011 with approximately 71 billion of cash and shortterm investments the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from our international offshore divestitures that are held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries we do not currently expect to repatriate such amounts to the us if we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash and shortterm investments held by these foreign subsidiaries we would be required to accrue and pay current income taxes in accordance with current us tax law with these proceeds remaining outside of the us we expect to continue using commercial paper or credit facility borrowings in the us to supplement our us based operating cash flow we do not expect nearterm increases in such borrowings will have a material effect on our overall liquidity or financial condition 

  

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by both fitch and standard  poor’s and baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 35 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 45 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2011 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

capital expenditures 

our 2012 capital expenditures are expected to range from 62 billion to 68 billion including 55 billion to 59 billion for our oil and gas operations to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2012 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2012 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2012 our existing commodity hedging contracts available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2012 capital expenditures 

additionally our financial and operational flexibility will be further enhanced by the transaction that we announced in early 2012 with sinopec international petroleum exploration  production corporation which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2012 pursuant to the agreement sinopec will pay 25 billion including a 900 million payment at closing and 16 billion toward our share of future drilling costs and will receive a 333 interest in five of our new venture plays discussed in “items 1 and 2 business and properties” of this report 

the 900 million cash payment at closing will recoup more than 100 of our costs incurred up to the closing date additionally the proceeds from this transaction will significantly reduce our future capital commitments the drilling carry will fund 70 percent of our capital requirements related to these properties which results in sinopec paying 80 percent of the overall development costs during the carry period this will allow us to accelerate the derisking and commercialization of the five plays without diverting capital from our core development projects we expect the entire 16 billion carry will be realized by the end of 2014 

  

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 is provided in the following table 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

contingencies and legal matters 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 18 to the financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data our engineers prepare our reserve estimates we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by outside petroleum consultants in 2011 95 of our reserves were subjected to such audits 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 2 percent of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period such rules also dictate that a 10 percent discount factor be used therefore the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 percent discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition due to the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved 

  

reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

derivative financial instruments 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production that hedge the future prices received our commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using us treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of our interestrate swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers 

counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with fourteen separate counterparties and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with five separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels thresholds generally range from zero to 55 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2011 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were within our established guidelines 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of 

  

the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

goodwill 

the annual impairment test which we conduct as of october 31 each year includes an assessment of qualitative factors and requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill impairment test the most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment we develop estimated fair values of our property and equipment by performing various quantitative analyses using information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

in our comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that are comparable to our respective reporting units such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of the operations in our comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently in our premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently we then review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the median premiums paid 

we then use the comparable company multiples comparable transaction multiples transaction premiums and other data to develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment we also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting units at october 31 2011 the date of our last impairment test the fair values of our us and canadian reporting units substantially exceeded their related carrying values 

a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that 

  

some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred or even current us income tax expense the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” of this report consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production through various financial transactions that hedge future prices received the key terms to all our oil gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2011 are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2011 a 10 percent increase and 10 percent decrease in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts 

 

 interest rate risk 

at december 31 2011 we had debt outstanding of 98 billion of this amount 61 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 63 percent additionally we had 37 billion of outstanding commercial paper bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 045 percent as of december 31 2011 we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in note 2 to the financial statements under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

the fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the federal funds rate and libor a 10 percent change in these forward curves would not materially impact our balance sheet at december 31 2011 

  

foreign currency risk 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 percent unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2011 balance sheet 

our noncanadian foreign subsidiaries have a us dollar functional currency however one of these foreign subsidiaries holds canadiandollar cash and engages in shortterm intercompany loans with canadian subsidiaries that are sometimes based in canadian dollars additionally at december 31 2011 we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the canadiandollar cash the increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the us dollar equivalent of the canadiandollar cash the value of the intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the loans into the us dollar functional currency based on the amount of the intercompany loans as of december 31 2011 a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not materially impact our balance sheet

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in exploration development and production of natural gas and oil our operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the united states and canada we also have offshore operations located in brazil and angola that are currently in the process of being divested 

 

to complement our upstream oil and gas operations in north america we have a large marketing and midstream operation with these operations we market gas crude oil and ngls we also construct and operate pipelines storage and treating facilities and natural gas processing plants these midstream facilities are used to transport oil gas and ngls and process natural gas 

 

we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

 

strategy 

 

as an enterprise we aspire to be the premier independent natural gas and oil company in north america to achieve this we continuously strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flows earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we do this by 

 

  

over the decade leading up to 2010 we captured an abundance of resources by carrying out this strategy we pioneered horizontal drilling in the barnett shale and extended this technique to other natural gas shale plays in the united states and canada we became proficient with steamassisted gravity drainage with our jackfish oil sands development in alberta canada we achieved key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore brazil we have tripled our proved oil and gas reserves since 2000 and have also assembled an extensive inventory of exploration assets representing additional unproved resources 

 

building off our past successes in november 2009 we announced plans to strategically reposition devon as a north american onshore exploration and production company as part of this strategic repositioning we are bringing forward the value of our offshore assets located in the gulf of mexico and countries outside north america by divesting them as of the end of 2010 we had sold our properties in the gulf of mexico azerbaijan china and other international regions generating 56 billion in aftertax proceeds additionally we have entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in brazil and angola and are waiting for the respective governments to approve the divestitures once the pending transactions are complete we expect to have generated more than 8 billion in aftertax proceeds 

 

this repositioning has allowed us to focus our operations on our premier portfolio of north american onshore assets historically our north american onshore assets have consistently provided us our highest riskadjusted investment returns by selling our offshore assets we are able to conduct an aggressive yet disciplined pursuit of the untapped value of these north american onshore opportunities more specifically 

given the current challenged market for natural gas prices our nearterm focus is on the oil and liquidsrich opportunities that exist within our balanced portfolio of properties 

 

besides investing in our onshore exploration and development opportunities we are also using the divestiture proceeds to reduce our debt significantly and conduct up to a 35 billion common share repurchase program 

 

presentation of discontinued operations 

 

as a result of our november 2009 repositioning announcement all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore financial data and operational data such as reserves production wells and acreage provided in this document exclude amounts related to our international operations unless otherwise provided 

 

our us offshore operations do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operational data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations that were divested in 2010 where appropriate we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets 

 

development of business 

 

since our first issuance of common stock to the public in 1988 we have executed strategies that have been focused on growth and value creation for our shareholders we increased our total proved reserves from 8 mmboe at yearend 1987 to 2873 mmboe at yearend 2010 during this same time period we increased annual production from 1 mmboe in 1987 to 228 mmboe in 2010 our expansion over this time period is attributable to a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years as well as active and successful exploration and development programs in more recent years additionally our growth has provided meaningful value creation for our shareholders the growth statistics from 1987 to 2010 translate into annual per share growth rates of 8 for production and 11 for reserves 

 

as a result of this growth we have become one of the largest independent oil and gas companies in north america during 2010 we continued to build off our past successes with a number of key accomplishments including those discussed below 

 

  

construction of our second jackfish project is now complete we expect to begin injecting steam at jackfish 2 in the second quarter with first oil production expected by the end of 2011 we applied for regulatory approval of a third phase of jackfish in the third quarter of 2010 

  

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

 

notes 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

oil natural gas and ngl marketing and delivery commitments 

 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more or shortterm less than one year agreements regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or market sensitive prices 

 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

oil marketing 

 

our oil production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of january 2011 approximately 81 of our oil production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices the remaining 19 of oil production was sold under longterm marketindexed contracts that are subject to market pricing variations 

 

natural gas marketing 

 

our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of january 2011 approximately 81 of our gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 18 of our production was committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at marketsensitive prices the remaining 1 of our gas production was sold under longterm fixedprice contracts 

 

ngl marketing 

 

our ngl production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary as of january 2011 approximately 83 of our ngl production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices approximately 9 of our ngl production was sold under shortterm fixedprice contracts the remaining 8 of ngl production was sold under longterm marketsensitive price contracts 

delivery commitments 

 

a portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity although exact amounts vary as of january 2011 we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of our oil and natural gas production 

 

 

 

 

  

we expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves we expect to fulfill our longerterm delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves in certain regions we expect to fulfill these longerterm delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information related to our proved reserves including the development of our proved undeveloped reserves 

 

our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future delivery commitments however should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our future delivery commitments we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments 

 

marketing and midstream activities 

 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil gas and ngl production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area we have other natural gas processing plants that support our operations including a plant completed in 2010 that serves the canawoodford shale production our midstream assets also include our 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish heavy oil production with condensate or other blendstock and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale 

 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

 8 

 

customers 

 

we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

 

the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

 

our ngl production is primarily sold to customers engaged in petrochemical refining and heavy oil blending activities pipelines railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products to market 

 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues 

 

seasonal nature of business 

 

generally the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

 

public policy and government regulation 

 

the oil and natural gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations and other policy implementations affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to public policy changes numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes affecting the oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength 

 

during 2010 as part of a strategic restructuring of the company we sold our properties in the gulf of mexico and the majority of our assets outside north america additionally we have entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in brazil and angola and are waiting for the respective governments to approve the divestitures these divestitures reduce our vulnerability to laws rules and regulations imposed by foreign governments as well as those imposed in the united states for offshore exploration and production the following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations in the united states and canada 

 

exploration and production regulation 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations relate to matters that include but are not limited to 

 

 9 

 

  

our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the united states some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the bureau of land management of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands 

 

royalties and incentives in canada 

 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays tax credits and fixed rate and profitsharing royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

 

pricing and marketing in canada 

 

any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

environmental and occupational regulations 

 

we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local international laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things 

 

  

the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems is required to be implemented for some international oil and gas operations 

 

we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however we do not maintain 100 coverage concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a violation of law 

 

in 2010 the united states environmental protection agency “epa” issued rules requiring oil and natural gas companies to track and report their greenhouse gas emissions for devon this involves collecting emissions data at more than 17000 well sites and numerous natural gas plants and compressor stations while these rules increase our cost of doing business we do not anticipate that we would be impacted to any greater degree than other similar oil and natural gas companies 

 

the kyoto protocol was adopted by numerous countries in 1997 and implemented in 2005 the protocol requires reductions of certain emissions of greenhouse gases although the united states has not ratified the protocol the other countries in which we operate have in 2007 canada ratified the kyoto protocol and committed to reducing canada’s greenhouse gas emissions this commitment was renewed by signing the copenhagen accord in 2009 and the cancun agreement in 2010 although there is no framework in place canada remains focused on the original reduction target of the kyoto protocol and is working to align greenhouse gas policy with the united states the mandatory reductions on greenhouse gas emissions will create additional costs for the canadian oil and gas industry including devon provincially british columbia and alberta have greenhouse gas legislation and regulation that carry some compliance burden for the oil and gas sector presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any future laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions reductions in canada or elsewhere but such expenditures could be substantial 

 

in 2006 we established our corporate climate change position and strategy key components of the strategy include initiation of energy efficiency measures tracking emerging climate change legislation and publication of a corporate greenhouse gas emission inventory we last published our emission inventory on january 2008 we will publish another emission inventory on or before march 31 2011 to comply with a reporting mandate issued by the epa additionally we continue to explore energy efficiency measures and 

greenhouse emission reduction opportunities we also continue to monitor legislative and regulatory climate change developments such as the proposals described above 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 5000 employees we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil gas and ngls which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability additional discussion of our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — preparation of reserves estimates and reserves audits” 

 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the costs of properties available for acquisition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

 

midstream capacity constraints and interruptions impact commodity sales 

 

we rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our production to downstream markets such midstream systems include the systems we operate as well as systems operated by a number of different third parties when possible we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us 

 

regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants pipelines or gathering systems such access could be lost due to a number of factors including but not limited to weather conditions accidents field labor issues or strikes additionally we and thirdparties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability 

 

hedging activities limit participation in commodity price increases and increase exposure to counterparty credit risk 

 

we periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil gas and ngl price volatility to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts in addition our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 

 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

 

our operations are generally subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the united states and canada in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability financial condition and liquidity particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing income taxes and climate change as discussed below 

hydraulic fracturing  — the us congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and naturalgas industry in the hydraulicfracturing process currently regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements this legislation if adopted could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal level 

 

income taxes  — the us president’s recent budget proposals include provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to united states tax laws the most significant change would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs 

 

climate change  — policy makers in the united states are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to harmful climatic changes policy makers at both the united states federal and state level have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development of capandtrade programs these programs generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances capandtrade programs would be relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases additionally the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 

 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

 

insurance does not cover all risks 

 

exploration development production and processing of oil gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrence including but not limited to blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 

 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

 

our operations outside north america are based in brazil and angola as noted earlier in this report we are in the process of divesting our operations outside north america however until we cease operating in these locations we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties in these areas that are more prevalent than what exist for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

 

 15 

 

  

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost these assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

 

certain of our investments are subject to risks that may affect their liquidity and value 

 

to maximize earnings on available cash balances we periodically invest in securities that we consider to be shortterm in nature and generally available for shortterm liquidity needs during 2007 we purchased assetbacked securities that have an auction rate reset feature “auction rate securities” our auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of more than 20 years however the underlying interest rates on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to 28 days therefore when we bought these securities they were generally priced and subsequently traded as shortterm investments because of the interest rate reset feature at december 31 2010 our auction rate securities totaled 94 million 

 

since february 8 2008 we have experienced difficulty selling our securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provided liquidity to these securities an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature due to continued auction failures throughout 2009 and 2010 we consider these investments to be longterm in nature and generally not available for shortterm liquidity needs therefore we have classified these investments as other longterm assets 

 

our auction rate securities are rated aaa — the highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and are collateralized by student loans that are substantially guaranteed by the united states government these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by problems in the global credit markets including but not limited to us subprime mortgage defaults and writedowns by major financial institutions due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios these and other 

related factors have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues if issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate our ability to liquidate these securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited under such circumstances we may record an impairment charge on these investments in the future

property overview 

 

our oil and gas operations are concentrated within various north american onshore basins across the united states and canada our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions these ownership interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

 

as previously mentioned we have completed substantially all of our offshore divestitures with the exception of assets in brazil and angola we have entered into agreements to sell these assets and are waiting for the respective governments to approve the divestitures 

 

we also have a substantial midstream business that includes natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems across north america in aggregate we have ownership in approximately 13000 miles of pipeline and 65 natural gas processing and treating plants our most significant concentration of midstream assets is located in north texas at our barnett shale field these assets include over 3000 miles of pipeline two natural gas processing plants with 750 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator in 2010 we completed construction of a natural gas processing plant to support the growing development of our canawoodford shale properties the cana plant has an initial capacity of 200 mmcf per day with the design capacity to expand up to 600 mmcf per day 

 

our midstream assets also include the access pipeline transportation system in canada this 220mile dual pipeline system extends from our jackfish operations in alberta with connectivity to a 350 mbbls storage terminal near edmonton the dual pipeline system allows us to deliver diluents to jackfish for the blending of our heavy oil production and transport the combined product to the edmonton crude oil market for sale we have a 50 ownership interest in the access pipeline 

the following sections provide additional details of our oil and gas properties including information about proved reserves production wells acreage and drilling activities

preparation of reserves estimates and reserves audits 

 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates such qualifications include any or all of the following 

 

  

the current director of the group has all of the qualifications listed above the current director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with sec definitions and guidance since 1987 he has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the united states both onshore and offshore as well as in canada asia the middle east and south america he has been employed by devon for the past ten years 

including the past three in his current position as director of reserves and economics during his career with devon and others he was the primary reservoir engineer for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

as the primary reservoir engineer he was responsible for reserves estimation on each of these projects these reserves estimates were utilized internally and for sec filings 

 

from 2003 to 2010 he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team reviewing reserves and resource estimates for projects including but not limited to 

 

  

additionally the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our vice president of budget and reserves who reports to our chief financial officer no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2010 we engaged two such firms to audit a significant portion of our proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2010 reserve estimates for 94 of our us onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants audited 89 of our canadian reserves 

 

set forth below is a summary of the north american reserves that were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

na not applicable — we sold all our us offshore properties during 2010 

 

“prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant the society of petroleum engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum 

consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures 

 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors this committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee assists the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

 

the reserves committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants at those meetings the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following 

 

  

proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves 

 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves by continent and for each significant country as of december 31 2010 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

 

 

 

 23 

 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2010 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

 

proved developed reserves 

 

as presented in the previous table we had 2042 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2010 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

proved undeveloped reserves 

 

the following table presents the changes in our total proved undeveloped reserves during 2010 in mmboe 

 

 

 

at december 31 2010 we had 831 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves this represents a 2 increase as compared to 2009 and represents 29 of our total proved reserves a large contributor to the increase was our 2010 drilling activities which increased our proved undeveloped reserves 145 mmboe the divestiture of our gulf of mexico properties reduced our proved undeveloped reserves by 39 mmboe 

 

as a result of 2010 development activities we converted 91 mmboe or 11 of the 2009 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves this conversion rate implies a nineyear development cycle which exceeds the fiveyear general guideline for recording proved undeveloped reserves however our 

overall proved undeveloped conversion rate is largely impacted by the pace of development at jackfish excluding our jackfish reserves our 2010 proved undeveloped conversion rate implies a development cycle that approximates five years 

 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 our jackfish proved undeveloped reserves were 396 mmboe and 351 mmboe respectively development schedules for the jackfish reserves are primarily controlled by the need to keep the processing plants at their full capacity of 35000 barrels of oil per day per facility processing plant capacity is controlled by factors such as total steam processing capacity steamoil ratios and air quality discharge permits as a result these reserves will remain classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years currently the development schedule for these reserves extends though the year 2025 we have made significant funding commitments toward the development of the jackfish reserves 

 

see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for further discussion of the contributions by project area of all changes to total proved reserves 

 

proved reserves cash flows 

 

the following table presents estimated cash flow information related to our december 31 2010 estimated proved reserves similar to reserves the cash flow estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

operation of properties 

 

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

 

we are the operator of 23056 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

title to properties 

 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be reviewed in conjunction with our “selected financial data” and “financial statements and supplementary data” our discussion and analysis relates to the following subjects 

 

  

overview of business 

 

devon is one of north america’s leading independent oil and gas exploration and production companies our operations are focused in the united states and canada we also own natural gas pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas making us one of north america’s larger processors of natural gas liquids 

 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flows earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis we accomplish this by replenishing our reserves and production and managing other key operational elements that drive our success these items are discussed more fully below

overview of 2010 results 

 

2010 was an outstanding year for devon we reported record net earnings and reserves and made significant progress on our offshore divestiture program announced in november 2009 we sold our properties in the gulf of mexico azerbaijan china and other international regions generating 56 billion in aftertax proceeds and aftertax gains of 17 billion additionally we have entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in brazil and angola and are waiting for the respective governments to approve the 

divestitures once the pending transactions are complete we expect to have generated more than 8 billion in aftertax proceeds from all our divestitures 

 

these divestitures have allowed us to begin focusing entirely on our north american onshore oil and natural gas portfolio we grew north american onshore production 1 in 2010 and replaced approximately 175 of our production with the drill bit at very attractive costs the operational success we had with the drill bit increased our reserves to 2873 mmboe the highest level in our history 

 

while our total north american onshore production grew 1 in 2010 our oil and ngl production increased 6 over 2009 liquids prices began to stabilize in 2009 and continued to strengthen throughout 2010 although our realized price for gas increased 17 in 2010 gas prices continue to be weak considering the current and expected trends in commodity pricing we have leveraged the value of our balanced portfolio and shifted capital spending toward the more profitable liquidsrich development opportunities currently available to us the performance of these assets and higher price realizations are reflected in the 2010 earnings increase 

 

key measures of our performance for 2010 as well as certain operational developments are summarized below 

 

  

from an operational perspective we completed another successful year with the drillbit we drilled 1584 gross wells on our north america onshore properties with a 99 success rate and grew our related proved reserves 9 

 

during 2010 we more than doubled our industryleading leasehold position in the liquidsrich canawoodford shale play in western oklahoma to more than 240000 net acres this allowed us to grow production more than 210 from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010 as a result of the success of our drilling and development efforts in the canawoodford shale we also constructed a gas processing plant in 2010 

 

in the barnett shale we exited 2010 with production of 12 bcfe per day which includes 43 mbbls per day of liquids production this represents a 16 increase in total production compared to the 2009 exit rate 

 

in the permian basin we continued to assemble additional liquidsrich acreage by the end of 2010 we had approximately one million net acres on liquidsrich development opportunities which led to an increase in production of 16 from the end of 2009 to the end of 2010 

 

our net production from our jackfish oil sands project in canada averaged 25 mbbls per day jackfish continues to be one of canada’s most successful steamassisted gravity drainage projects construction of our second jackfish project is now complete we expect to have first oil production by the end of 2011 additionally we applied for regulatory approval of a third phase of jackfish in 2010 

 

during 2010 we used a portion of our offshore divestiture proceeds to invest 12 billion in unproved leasehold acquisition focused on oil and liquidsrich gas plays our most significant single investment was our 500 million acquisition of a 50 interest in the pike oil sands the pike acreage lies immediately adjacent to 

the jackfish project we began appraisal drilling at pike near the end of 2010 and are acquiring seismic data the drilling results and seismic will help us determine the optimal configuration for the initial phase of development we expect to begin the regulatory application process for the first pike phase around the end of 2011 

 

our performance and offshore divestiture success throughout 2010 enabled us to end the year with a robust level of liquidity at the end of 2010 we had 34 billion of cash and shortterm investments and 26 billion of available credit 

 

business and industry outlook 

 

even though we possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility we are fully committed to exercising capital discipline maximizing profits maintaining balance sheet strength and optimizing growth per debtadjusted share our portfolio of assets provides a great deal of investment flexibility at the end of 2010 our proved reserves were comprised of approximately 60 gas and 40 liquids while gas prices remain challenged in the market our nearterm focus is on the oil and liquidsrich opportunities that exist within our balanced portfolio of properties as a result the vast majority of our 2011 drilling activity will be centered on our oil and liquidsrich gas properties should the outlook for commodity prices change we have the flexibility to redirect our capital to ensure we continually focus on the highestreturn assets in our portfolio 

 

our ability to leverage the depth and breadth of our existing portfolio of properties will be key to the successful execution of our growth and valuecreation objectives with 29 billion boe of proved reserves at the end of 2010 our north american onshore assets will provide many years of visible economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas in 2011 we are targeting a 68 production increase however we expect this growth will be driven by oil and ngls growth of at least 16 additionally we will continue to use a portion of our offshore divestiture proceeds to repurchase common stock under our 35 billion share repurchase program therefore our 2011 production growth will be even higher on a per debtadjusted share basis 

 

results of operations 

 

as previously stated we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets as a result all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore the production revenue and expense amounts presented in this “results of operations” section exclude amounts related to our international assets unless otherwise noted 

 

even though we have divested our us offshore operations these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operating data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations to facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets where appropriate 

revenues 

 

our oil gas and ngl production volumes are shown in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 38 

 

the following table presents the prices we realized on our production volumes these prices exclude any effects due to our oil gas and ngl derivatives 

 

 

 

 

  

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales between 2008 and 2010 

 

 

oil sales 

 

2010 vs 2009 oil sales increased 557 million as a result of a 27 increase in our realized price the largest contributor to the increase in our realized price was the increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price over the same time period 

 

oil sales decreased 67 million due to a three percent decrease in production the decrease was comprised of the net effects of a 62 decrease in our us offshore production and a five percent increase in our north america onshore production the decrease in our us offshore production was primarily due to the divestiture of such properties in the second quarter of 2010 the increased north america onshore production resulted primarily from continued development of our permian basin properties in texas and our jackfish thermal heavy oil project in canada 

 

2009 vs 2008 oil sales decreased 13 billion as a result of a 38 decrease in our realized price without hedges the largest contributor to the decrease in our realized price was the decrease in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price over the same time period 

 

oil sales increased 258 million due to a three million barrel or 8 increase in production the increased production resulted primarily from the continued development of jackfish in canada 

 

gas sales 

 

2010 vs 2009 gas sales increased 497 million as a result of a 16 increase in our realized price without hedges this increase was largely due to increases in the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

 

a four percent decrease in production during 2010 caused gas sales to decrease by 122 million the decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our us offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010 as well as higher canadian government royalties also our other north america onshore properties decreased one percent due to reduced drilling during most of 2009 in response to lower gas prices as a result of the reduced drilling activities during 2009 natural declines of existing wells outpaced production gains from new drilling in 2010 

 

2009 vs 2008 gas sales decreased 43 billion as a result of a 57 decrease in our realized price without hedges this decrease was largely due to decreases in the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

 

a three percent increase in production during 2009 caused gas sales to increase by 222 million our north america onshore properties contributed 40 bcf of higher volumes this increase included 25 bcf of higher production in canada due to a decline in canadian government royalties resulting largely from lower gas prices the remainder of the north america onshore growth resulted from new drilling and development that exceeded natural production declines primarily in the barnett shale field in north texas these increases were partially offset by 12 bcf of lower production from our us offshore properties largely resulting from natural production declines 

 

ngl sales 

 

2010 vs 2009 ngl sales increased 254 million during 2010 as a result of a 32 increase in our realized price the increase was largely due to an increase in the mont belvieu texas index price over the same time period ngl sales increased 46 million in 2010 due to a six percent increase in production the increase in production was primarily due to increased drilling in north america onshore areas that have liquidsrich gas 

 

2009 vs 2008 ngl sales decreased 585 million as a result of a 44 decrease in our realized price this decrease was largely due to a decrease in the mont belvieu texas index price over the same time period ngl sales increased 89 million in 2009 due to a seven percent increase in production the increase in production is primarily due to drilling and development in the barnett shale 

oil gas and ngl derivatives 

 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil gas and ngl hedges the first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements the prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our oil gas and ngl derivatives include price swaps costless collars and basis swaps for the price swaps we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty the price collars set a floor and ceiling price if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we cashsettle the difference with the counterparty for the basis swaps we receive a fixed differential between two index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty cash settlements presented in the tables above represent net realized gains or losses related to these various instruments 

additionally to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we have sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012 the call options give the counterparty the right to place us into a price swap at a predetermined fixed price the terms of these call options are presented in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

 

during 2010 and 2009 we received 888 million or 096 per mcf and 505 million or 052 per mcf respectively from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives during 2008 we paid 424 million or 046 per mcf to counterparties to settle our gas derivatives and received 27 million or 070 per bbl from counterparties to settle our oil derivatives we had no settlements on ngl derivatives in any of these periods 

 

in addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil gas and ngl derivative instruments in each reporting period we estimate the fair values of these derivatives primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments based on the amount of volumes subject to our gas derivative financial instruments at december 31 2010 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased our 2010 unrealized gains by approximately 154 million a 10 increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivative financial instruments would have increased our 2010 unrealized losses by approximately 142 million another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility finally the amount of production subject to oil gas and ngl derivatives is not a variable in our cash flow calculations but it does impact the total derivative values 

 

counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with thirteen separate counterparties additionally our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade the marktomarket exposure threshold above which collateral must be posted decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2010 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

including the cash settlements discussed above our oil gas and ngl derivatives generated net gains of 811 million and 384 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively and a net loss of 154 million during 2008 in addition to the impact of cash settlements these net gains and losses were impacted by new positions and settlements that occurred during each period as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves a summary of our outstanding oil gas and ngl derivative positions as of december 31 2010 is included in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

the details of the changes in marketing and midstream revenues operating costs and expenses and the resulting operating profit are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

2010 vs 2009 marketing and midstream revenues increased 333 million and operating costs and expenses increased 335 million causing operating profit to decrease 2 million both revenues and expenses increased primarily due to higher natural gas and ngl prices partially offset by the effects of lower gas marketing profits 

 

2009 vs 2008 marketing and midstream revenues decreased 758 million and operating costs and expenses decreased 589 million causing operating profit to decrease 169 million both revenues and expenses decreased primarily due to lower natural gas and ngl prices partially offset by higher ngl production and gas pipeline throughput 

 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

the details of the changes in loe are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

2010 vs 2009 loe increased 19 million in 2010 which included a 118 million increase related to our north america onshore operations and a 99 million decrease related to our us offshore operations north america onshore loe increased 78 million due to changes in the exchange rate between the us and 

canadian dollars the remainder of the increase in north america onshore loe is primarily due to increased costs related to our jackfish operation in canada us offshore loe decreased primarily due to property divestitures in the second quarter of 2010 the increase due to exchange rates was also the main contributor to the changes in north america onshore and total loe per boe 

 

2009 vs 2008 loe decreased 181 million in 2009 loe dropped 182 million due to declining costs for fuel materials equipment and personnel as well as declines in maintenance and well workover projects such declines largely resulted from decreasing demand for field services due to lower oil and gas prices changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar reduced loe 49 million additionally loe decreased 31 million as a result of hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our us offshore facilities and transportation systems these factors excluding the hurricane damage were also the main contributors to the decrease in loe per boe on our north america onshore properties production growth at our largescale jackfish project also contributed to a decrease in loe per boe as jackfish production approached the facility’s capacity during 2009 its perunit costs declined contributing to lower overall loe per boe the remainder of our four percent companywide production growth added 81 million to loe during 2009 

 

taxes other than income taxes 

 

taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of production taxes and ad valorem taxes assessed by various government agencies on our us onshore properties production taxes are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by property and government jurisdiction ad valorem taxes generally are based on property values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax the following table details the changes in our taxes other than income taxes 

 

 

 

 

  

2010 vs 2009 production taxes increased 78 million in 2010 this increase was largely due to higher us onshore revenues as well as a decrease in production tax credits associated with certain properties in the state of texas ad valorem taxes decreased 10 million primarily due to lower assessed values of our us onshore oil and gas property and equipment 

 

2009 vs 2008 production taxes decreased 174 million in 2009 this decrease was largely due to lower us onshore revenues as well as an increase in production tax credits associated with certain properties in the state of texas ad valorem taxes increased 13 million primarily due to higher assessed oil and gas property and equipment values 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties “dda” 

 

dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents our capitalized investment net of accumulated dda and reductions of carrying value plus future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

the changes in our production volumes dda rate per unit and dda of oil and gas properties are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table details the changes in dda of oil and gas properties between 2008 and 2010 due to the changes in production volumes and dda rate presented in the table above in millions 

 

 

 

2010 vs 2009 oil and gas propertyrelated dda decreased 114 million during 2010 due to a six percent decrease in the dda rate the largest contributors to the rate decrease were our 2010 us offshore property divestitures and a reduction of the carrying value of our united states oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 this reduction totaled 64 billion and resulted from a full cost ceiling limitation these decreases were partially offset by the effects of costs incurred and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2010 drilling and development activities as well as changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 

 

2009 vs 2008 oil and gas property related dda decreased 12 billion due to a 40 decrease in the dda rate the largest contributors to the rate decrease were reductions of the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008 these reductions totaled 163 billion and resulted from full cost ceiling limitations in the united states and canada in addition the effects of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars also contributed to the rate decrease these factors were partially offset by the effects of costs incurred and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2009 drilling activities partially offsetting the impact from the lower 2009 dda rate was our four percent production increase which caused oil and gas property related dda expense to increase 130 million 

 

the impact of adopting the sec’s new modernization of oil and gas reporting rules at the end of 2009 had virtually no impact on our dda rate 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially offset by two components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the 

consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities marketing and midstream activities as well as corporate overhead activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

 

 

 

 

  

2010 vs 2009 gross ga decreased 120 million largely due to a decline in employee severance costs such costs decreased primarily due to gulf of mexico employees that were impacted by the integration of our gulf of mexico and international operations into one offshore unit in the second quarter of 2009 and other employee departures during 2009 gross ga as well as capitalized ga also decreased subsequent to our midyear 2010 gulf of mexico divestitures as a result of the decline in our workforce the gulf of mexico divestitures were also the main contributor to the decrease in ga reimbursements gross and capitalized ga also declined due to reduced spending initiatives for certain discretionary cost categories these decreases were partially offset by an increase due to the effects of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 

 

2009 vs 2008 gross ga increased 4 million this increase was due to approximately 60 million of higher costs for employee compensation and benefits mostly offset by the effects of our 2009 reduced spending initiatives for certain discretionary cost categories 

 

employee cost increases in 2009 included an additional 57 million of severance costs this increase was primarily due to gulf of mexico and other employee departures during 2009 additionally postretirement benefit costs increased approximately 50 million the increases in employee costs were partially offset by a 27 million decrease due to accelerated sharebased compensation expense recognized in 2008 resulting from a modification of certain executives compensation arrangements the modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who meet certain yearsofservice and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding sharebased grants although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of the executives’ grants it does accelerate the expense recognition as executives approach the yearsofservice and age criteria 

 

restructuring costs 

 

the following schedule includes the components of restructuring costs 

 

 

employee severance 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recognized 153 million of estimated employee severance costs associated with the planned divestiture of our offshore assets that was announced in november 2009 this amount was based on estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of sharebased grants of the 153 million total 105 million related to our us offshore operations and the remainder related to our international discontinued operations 

 

during 2010 we divested all of our us offshore assets and a significant part of our international assets as a result of these divestitures and associated employee terminations we decreased our estimate of employee severance costs in 2010 by 31 million more offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in our us onshore operations and this caused the 31 million decrease to our severance estimate this decrease includes 27 million related to our us offshore operations and 4 million related to our international discontinued operations 

 

lease obligations 

 

as a result of the divestitures discussed above we ceased using certain office space that was subject to noncancellable operating lease arrangements consequently in 2010 we recognized 70 million of restructuring costs that represent the present value of our future obligations under the leases net of anticipated sublease income the estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases these estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases 

 

asset impairments 

 

in 2010 we recognized 11 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space we ceased using 

 

interest expense 

 

the following schedule includes the components of interest expense 

 

 

 

2010 vs 2009 interest based on debt outstanding decreased in 2010 primarily due to the retirement of 177 million of 10125 notes upon their maturity in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the early redemption of our 725 senior notes as discussed below 

 

capitalized interest decreased during 2010 primarily due to the divestitures of our us offshore properties during the first half of 2010 which was partially offset by higher capitalized interest associated with our canadian oil sands development projects 

 

in the second quarter of 2010 we redeemed 350 million of 725 senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity of october 1 2011 the notes were redeemed for 384 million which represented 100 percent of the principal amount a makewhole premium of 28 million and 6 million of accrued and unpaid interest on the date of redemption these notes also had an unamortized premium of 9 million the 19 million presented 

in the table above represents the net of the 28 million makewhole premium and 9 million amortization of the remaining premium 

 

2009 vs 2008 interest based on debt outstanding increased 11 million from 2008 to 2009 this increase was primarily due to interest paid on the 500 million of 5625 senior unsecured notes and 700 million of 630 senior unsecured notes that we issued in january 2009 this was partially offset by lower interest resulting from the retirement of our exchangeable debentures during the third quarter of 2008 and lower interest rates on our floatingrate commercial paper borrowings 

 

capitalized interest decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the sales of our west african exploration and development properties in 2008 and the completion of the access pipeline transportation system in canada in the second quarter of 2008 

 

interestrate and other financial instruments 

 

the details of the changes in our interestrate and other financial instruments are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

interest rate swaps 

 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we received cash settlements totaling 44 million 40 million and 1 million respectively from counterparties to settle our interest rate swaps 

 

in addition to recognizing cash settlements we recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps each reporting period we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers in 2010 we recorded an unrealized loss of 30 million as a result of changes in interest rates in 2009 and 2008 we recorded unrealized gains of 66 million and 104 million respectively as a result of changes in interest rates 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by a third party based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate swaps at december 31 2010 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased our 2010 unrealized loss for our interest rate swaps by approximately 68 million 

 

similar to our commodity derivative contracts counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with seven separate counterparties additionally our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade the marktomarket exposure threshold above which collateral must be posted decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of december 31 2010 

chevron common stock and related embedded option 

 

until october 31 2008 we owned 142 million shares of chevron common stock and recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of this investment on october 31 2008 we exchanged these shares of chevron common stock for chevron’s interest in the drunkard’s wash properties located in eastcentral utah and 280 million in cash in accordance with the terms of the exchange the fair value of our investment in the chevron shares was estimated to be 6771 per share on the exchange date prior to the exchange of these shares we calculated the fair value of our investment in chevron common stock using chevron’s published market price 

 

we also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron common stock the embedded option was not actively traded in an established market therefore we estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for trades occurring near the valuation date 

 

the loss during 2008 on our investment in chevron common stock was directly attributable to a 2562 per share decrease in the estimated fair value while we owned chevron’s common stock during the year the gain on the embedded option during 2008 was directly attributable to the change in fair value of the chevron common stock from january 1 2008 to the maturity date of august 15 2008 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

during 2009 and 2008 we reduced the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

 

 

the 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the 2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter the reductions resulted from significant decreases in each country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately preceding quarter the lower united states ceiling value in the first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of declining natural gas prices subsequent to december 31 2008 the lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008 largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil gas and ngl prices compared to september 30 2008 

 

to demonstrate these declines the march 31 2009 december 31 2008 and september 30 2008 weighted average wellhead prices are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

 

na not applicable 

 

the march 31 2009 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4966 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 363 per mmbtu for gas the december 31 2008 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4460 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 571 per mmbtu for gas the september 30 2008 wellhead prices 

in the table compare to the nymex cash price of 10064 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 712 per mmbtu for gas 

 

other net 

 

the following table includes the components of other net 

 

 

 

interest and dividend income decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to a decrease in dividends received on our previously owned investment in chevron common stock and a decrease in interest received on cash equivalents due to lower rates and balances 

 

in 1995 the united states congress passed the deep water royalty relief act the intent of this legislation was to encourage deep water exploration in the gulf of mexico by providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain federal leases deep water leases issued in certain years by the minerals management service the “mms” have contained price thresholds such that if the market prices for oil or gas exceeded the thresholds for a given year royalty relief would not be granted for that year 

 

in october 2007 a federal district court ruled in favor of a plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price thresholds in deep water leases additionally in january 2009 a federal appellate court upheld this district court ruling this judgment was later appealed to the united states supreme court which in october 2009 declined to review the appellate court’s ruling the supreme court’s decision ended the mms’s judicial course to enforce the price thresholds 

 

prior to september 30 2009 we had 84 million accrued for potential royalties on various deep water leases based upon the supreme court’s decision we reduced to zero the 84 million loss contingency accrual in the third quarter of 2009 

 

in 2008 we recognized 162 million of excess insurance recoveries for damages suffered in 2005 related to hurricanes that struck the gulf of mexico the excess recoveries resulted from business interruption claims on policies that were in effect when the 2005 hurricanes occurred 

 

income taxes 

 

the following table presents our total income tax expense benefit and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate 

 

 

during 2010 and 2009 pursuant to the completed and planned divestitures of our international assets located outside north america a portion of our foreign earnings were no longer deemed to be permanently reinvested accordingly we recognized deferred income tax expense of 144 million and 55 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively related to assumed repatriations of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries 

 

during 2008 we recognized 312 million of additional income tax expense that resulted from two related factors associated with our foreign operations first during 2008 we repatriated 26 billion from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states second we made certain tax policy election changes in the second quarter of 2008 to minimize the taxes we otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations as well as the taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in west africa as a result of the repatriation and tax policy election changes we recognized 295 million of additional current tax expense and 17 million of additional deferred tax expense excluding the 312 million of additional tax expense our effective income tax benefit rate would have been 34 for 2008 

 

earnings from discontinued operations 

 

for all years presented in the following tables our discontinued operations include amounts related to our assets in azerbaijan brazil china and other minor international properties additionally during 2008 our discontinued operations included amounts related to our assets in west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region until they were sold following are the components of earnings from discontinued operations 

 

 

the following table presents gains on our offshore and african divestiture transactions by year 

 

 

 

2010 vs 2009 earnings increased 19 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of the 15 billion gain 15 billion after taxes from the divestiture of our azerbaijan operations and the 308 million gain 235 million after taxes from the divestiture of our panyu operations in china also earnings increased 109 million due to the 2009 reductions of carrying value of our oil and gas properties which primarily related to brazil the brazilian reduction resulted largely from an exploratory well drilled at the bmbar3 block in the offshore barreirinhas basin after drilling this well in the first quarter of 2009 we concluded that the well did not have adequate reserves for commercial viability as a result the seismic leasehold and drilling costs associated with this well contributed to the reduction recognized in the first quarter of 2009 

 

2009 vs 2008 earnings from discontinued operations decreased 617 million in 2009 our discontinued earnings were impacted by several factors first operating revenues declined largely due to a 36 decrease in the price realized on our production which was driven by a decline in crude oil index prices second both operating revenues and expenses declined due to divestitures that closed in 2008 earnings also decreased 752 million in 2009 due to larger gains recognized on west african asset divestitures in 2008 

 

partially offsetting these decreased earnings in 2009 was the larger reduction of carrying value recognized in 2008 compared to 2009 the reductions largely consisted of full cost ceiling limitations related to our assets in brazil that were caused by a decline in oil prices 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

the following discussion of capital resources uses and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” 

sources and uses of cash 

 

the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis therefore these amounts differ from capital expenditure amounts that include accruals and are referred to elsewhere in this document additional discussion of these items follows the table 

 

 

 

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2010 changes in operating cash flow from our continuing operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net earnings with the exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as dda financial instrument fair value changes property impairments and deferred income taxes as a result our operating cash flow increased 19 during 2010 primarily due to the increase in revenues as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

during 2010 our operating cash flow funded approximately 78 of our cash payments for capital expenditures however our capital expenditures for 2010 included 500 million paid to form a heavy oil joint venture and acquire a 50 percent interest in the pike oil sands in alberta canada this acquisition was completed in connection with the offshore divestitures discussed below excluding this 500 million acquisition our operating cash flow funded approximately 84 of our capital expenditures during 2010 offshore divestiture proceeds were used to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures 

 

during 2009 our operating cash flow funded approximately 87 of our cash payments for capital expenditures commercial paper borrowings were used to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures during 2008 our capital expenditures were primarily funded by our operating cash flow and preexisting cash balances 

 

other sources of cash — continuing and discontinued operations 

 

as needed we supplement our operating cash flow and available cash by accessing available credit under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program we may also issue longterm debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities additionally we may acquire shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances as needed we reduce such shortterm investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow and available cash 

 

during 2010 we divested our us offshore azerbaijan china and other minor international properties generating 66 billion in pretax proceeds net of closing adjustments or 56 billion after taxes we have used proceeds from these divestitures to repay all our commercial paper borrowings retire 350 million of other debt that was to mature in october 2011 and begin repurchasing our common shares in addition we began redeploying proceeds into our north america onshore properties including the 500 million pike oil sands acquisition mentioned above 

 

during 2009 we issued 500 million of 5625 senior unsecured notes due january 15 2014 and 700 million of 630 senior unsecured notes due january 15 2019 the net proceeds received of 1187 billion after discounts and issuance costs were used primarily to repay devon’s 1005 billion of outstanding commercial paper as of december 31 2008 subsequent to the 1005 billion commercial paper repayment in january 2009 we utilized additional commercial paper borrowings of 1431 billion to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow 

 

during 2008 we received 26 billion in pretax proceeds or 19 billion after taxes and purchase price adjustments from sales of assets located in equatorial guinea and other west african countries also in conjunction with these asset sales we repatriated an additional 26 billion of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states we used these combined sources of cash in 2008 to fund debt repayments common stock repurchases redemptions of preferred stock and dividends on common and preferred stock additionally we reduced our shortterm investment balances by 250 million and received 280 million from the exchange of our investment in chevron common stock 

capital expenditures 

 

our capital expenditures are presented by geographic area and type in the following table the amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods capital expenditures actually incurred during 2010 2009 and 2008 were approximately 69 billion 47 billion and 100 billion respectively 

 

 

 

our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling and development of oil and gas properties which totaled 59 billion 43 billion and 82 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in exploration and development capital spending in 2010 was partially due to the 500 million pike oil sands acquisition mentioned above additionally with rising oil and ngl prices and proceeds from our offshore divestiture program we are increasing drilling primarily to grow liquids production across our north america onshore portfolio of properties 

 

the decline in capital expenditures from 2008 to 2009 was due to decreased drilling activities in most of our operating areas in response to lower commodity prices in 2009 compared to previous years also the 2008 capital expenditures include 26 billion related to acquisitions of properties in texas louisiana oklahoma and canada 

 

capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and oil pipelines our midstream capital expenditures in 2010 were largely impacted by reduced us onshore dry gas drilling activities 

 

capital expenditures related to corporate activities increased in 2010 this increase is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in oklahoma city 

 

net repayments of debt 

 

during 2010 we repaid 14 billion of commercial paper borrowings and redeemed 350 million of 725 senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity of october 1 2011 primarily with proceeds received from our us offshore divestitures 

 

during 2009 we repaid our 177 million 10125 notes upon maturity in the fourth quarter 

 

during 2008 we repaid 15 billion in outstanding credit facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the sales of assets under our african divestiture program also during 2008 virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares of chevron common stock owned by us the debentures matured on august 15 2008 in lieu of delivering our shares of chevron common stock we exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders cash totaling 10 billion this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 652 million and a 379 million payment of the related embedded derivative option 

repurchases of common stock 

 

the following table summarizes our repurchases including unsettled shares under approved plans during 2010 and 2008 amounts and shares in millions 

 

 

 

no shares were repurchased in 2009 the 2010 program expires on december 31 2011 and the 2008 program and annual program expired on december 31 2009 

 

redemption of preferred stock 

 

on june 20 2008 we redeemed all 15 million outstanding shares of our 649 series a cumulative preferred stock each share of preferred stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of 100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date 

 

dividends 

 

devon paid common stock dividends of 281 million or 064 per share in 2010 and 284 million or 064 per share in both 2009 and 2008 respectively devon paid dividends of 5 million in 2008 to preferred stockholders devon redeemed its outstanding preferred stock in the second quarter of 2008 

 

liquidity 

 

historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity and debt securities that can be issued pursuant to our automatically effective registration statement filed with the sec this registration statement can be used to offer shortterm and longterm debt securities another major source of future liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our remaining offshore assets in brazil and angola we estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures share repurchases debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

 

operating cash flow 

 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil gas and ngls produced due to improving oil and ngl prices our operating cash flow increased approximately 16 to 55 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

 

commodity prices  — prices for oil gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in oil gas and ngl prices and are beyond our control we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2011 

 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various price swap fixedprice physical delivery and price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2011 production as of february 10 2011 approximately 29 of our 2011 gas production is associated with financial price swaps and fixedprice physicals we also have basis swaps associated with 02 bcf per day of our 2011 gas production additionally approximately 36 of our 2011 oil production is associated with financial price 

collars we also have call options that if exercised would hedge an additional 16 of our 2011 oil production 

 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices 

 

interest rates  — our operating cash flow can also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as of february 10 2011 we had total debt of 62 billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 64 to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility we have interest rate swap instruments with a total notional amount of 21 billion these consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps under the terms of the forward starting swaps we will net settle these contracts in september 2011 or sooner should we elect based upon us paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating rate including the effects of these swaps the weightedaverage interest rate related to our debt was 57 as of february 10 2011 

 

credit losses  — our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate we are also exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as discussed previously in this report we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions posting of letters of credit prepayment requirements and collateral posting requirements 

 

offshore divestitures 

 

during 2010 we sold our properties in the gulf of mexico azerbaijan china and other international regions generating 56 billion in aftertax proceeds additionally we have entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in brazil and angola and are waiting for the respective governments to approve the divestitures once the pending transactions are complete we expect to have generated more than 8 billion in aftertax proceeds similar to 2010 we expect to continue using the divestiture proceeds to invest in north america onshore exploration and development opportunities reduce our debt and repurchase our common shares 

 

credit availability 

 

we have a 265 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” that can be accessed to provide liquidity as needed the maturity date for 219 billion of the senior credit facility is april 7 2013 the maturity date for the remaining 046 billion is april 7 2012 all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders the senior credit facility includes a revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million 

 

amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate 

 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 22 billion also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is based on a 

standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market 

 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization as defined in the credit agreement of no more than 65 the credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures bonds notes payable credit facility borrowings and shortterm commercial paper borrowings in addition total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil gas and ngl production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables the credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2010 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 151 

 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

 

the following schedule summarizes the capacity of our senior credit facility by maturity date as well as our available capacity as of february 10 2011 in millions 

 

 

 

as presented in the table above we had 625 million of commercial paper borrowings as of february 10 2011 although we ended 2010 with 34 billion of cash and shortterm investments the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from our international offshore divestitures for the time being we have decided not to repatriate these proceeds to the united states or permanently invest them in canada this decision is based on our ongoing evaluation of our future cash needs across our operations in the united states and canada as well as the relatively low borrowing rates on our shortterm borrowings if we do not repatriate these proceeds to the united states in the nearterm we may continue to increase our commercial paper borrowings to supplement our operating cash flow in funding our common stock repurchases and capital expenditures 

 

debt ratings 

 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by both fitch and standard  poor’s and baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 35 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 45 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2010 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

 

capital expenditures 

 

our 2011 capital expenditures are expected to range from 54 billion to 60 billion to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if commodity prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2011 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2011 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2011 our existing commodity hedging contracts available cash balances and credit availability we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2011 capital expenditures 

 

common stock repurchase program 

 

as a result of the success we have experienced with our offshore divestiture program we announced a share repurchase program in may 2010 the program authorizes the repurchase of up to 35 billion of our common shares and expires december 31 2011 as of february 10 2011 we had repurchased 16 billion or 235 million of our shares at an average price of 6960 we will continue to use proceeds from our offshore divestiture program in 2011 to fund our repurchase program 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 is provided in the following table 

 

 

 

  

pension funding and estimates 

 

funded status  — as compared to the projected benefit obligation our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 492 million and 448 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2010 changes to our underfunded status is in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report of the 492 million underfunded status at the end of 2010 198 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans that have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2010 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 36 million the value of these trusts is in noncurrent other assets in our consolidated balance sheets included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

as compared to the accumulated benefit obligation our qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 218 million at december 31 2010 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels 

 

our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’ assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits earned by the participants as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the pension protection act while we did have investment gains in 2010 and 2009 the investment losses experienced during 2008 significantly reduced the value of our 

plans’ assets we estimate we will contribute approximately 84 million to our qualified pension plans during 2011 however actual contributions may be different than this amount 

 

our funding policy regarding the nonqualified defined benefit plans is to supplement as needed the amounts accumulated in the related trusts with available cash and cash equivalents 

 

pension estimate assumptions  — our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 85 million 119 million and 61 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 91 million in 2011 should our actual 2011 contributions to qualified and nonqualified plans vary significantly from our current estimate of 93 million our actual 2011 pension expense could vary from this estimate 

 

the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

 

we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 694 and 718 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets at december 31 2010 the target allocations for plan assets were 475 for equity securities 40 for fixedincome securities and 125 for other investment types equity securities consist of investments in large capitalization and small capitalization companies both domestic and international fixedincome securities include corporate bonds of investmentgrade companies from diverse industries united states treasury obligations and assetbacked securities other investment types include shortterm investment funds and a hedge fund of funds we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points would increase the expected 2011 pension expense by 6 million 

 

we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 550 and 600 at december 31 2010 and 2009 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled considering the expected timing of future cash flows related to the plans this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk high quality corporate bond yield indices are considered when selecting the discount rate 

 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our pension liability at december 31 2010 by 37 million and increase estimated 2011 pension expense by 5 million 

 

at december 31 2010 we had net actuarial losses of 357 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to investment losses on plan assets in 2008 reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages we estimate that approximately 32 million and 26 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2011 and 2012 respectively the 32 million estimated to be recognized in 2011 is a component of the total estimated 2011 pension expense of 91 million referred to earlier in this section 

 

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

contingencies and legal matters 

 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

 

the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

full cost method of accounting and proved reserves 

 

policy description 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties under this method all costs associated with property acquisition exploration and development activities are capitalized including our internal costs that can be directly identified with such activities capitalized costs are depleted on an equivalent unitofproduction method converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil depletion is calculated using the capitalized costs including estimated asset retirement costs plus the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves net of estimated salvage values costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties 

 

the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations additionally our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 22 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the amount of our reserves that are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants 

 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less 

than 2 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 

 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment this adjustment requires little judgment as the calculated average price is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges none of our outstanding derivative contracts at december 31 2010 qualified for hedge accounting treatment 

 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns in addition due to the interrelationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates however decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and thus our depletion expense decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown 

 

derivative financial instruments 

 

policy description 

 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production that hedge the future prices received these instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to commodity price volatility our commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps costless price collars and call options additionally we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of certain of our interestrate swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount the remainder of our swaps represent forward starting swaps under which we will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate on a total notional amount 

 

all derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met for derivative financial instruments held during 2010 2009 and 2008 we chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify our derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment cash settlements with counterparties to our derivative financial instruments also increase or decrease earnings at the time of the settlement 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future 

commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using united states treasury bill rates these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the libor and money market futures rates these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties andor brokers 

 

in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with thirteen separate counterparties and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with seven separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment grade” the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2010 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

goodwill 

 

policy description 

 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired with any excess recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value including goodwill then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the annual impairment test which we conduct as of october 31 each year requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting 

units we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill impairment test the most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment we develop estimated fair values of our property and equipment by performing various quantitative analyses based upon information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

 

in our comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that are comparable to our respective reporting units such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of the reserves in our comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently in our premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid 

 

we then use the comparable company multiples comparable transaction multiples transaction premiums and other data to develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment we also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting units at october 31 2010 the date of our last impairment test the fair values of our united states and canadian reporting units substantially exceeded their related carrying values 

 

a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

 

income taxes 

 

policy description 

 

we are required to estimate federal state provincial and foreign income taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing future tax consequences resulting in deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period applied at the applicable statutory tax rates we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and if required estimate and establish accruals for such amounts we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences operating losses and other tax carryforwards we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more 

likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances material changes in these accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing tax audits changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters 

 

forwardlooking estimates 

 

we are providing our 2011 forwardlooking estimates in this section these estimates were based on our examination of historical operating trends the information used to prepare our december 31 2010 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties the forwardlooking estimates in this report were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil gas and ngls during 2011 will be similar to 2010 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to our canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using an estimated average 2011 exchange rate of 095 dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

 

during 2011 our operations are substantially comprised of our ongoing north america onshore operations we also have international operations in brazil and angola that we are divesting we have entered into agreements to sell our assets in brazil for 32 billion and our assets in angola for 70 million plus contingent consideration as a result of these divestitures all revenues expenses and capital related to our international operations are reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements additionally all forwardlooking estimates in this document exclude amounts related to our international operations unless otherwise noted 

 

north america onshore operating items 

 

the following 2011 estimates relate only to our north america onshore assets 

 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

set forth below are our estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2011 we estimate that our combined oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 236 to 240 mmboe 

 

 

 

oil and gas prices 

 

we expect our 2011 average prices for the oil and gas production from each of our operating areas to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the expected ranges for prices are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the financial contracts presented in the “commodity price risk management” section below 

 

the nymex price for oil is determined using the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma the nymex price for gas is determined using the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc  

 

 

 

commodity price risk management 

 

from time to time we enter into nymex related financial commodity collar and price swap contracts such contracts are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil gas and ngl price volatility although these financial contracts do not relate to specific production from our operating areas they will affect our overall revenues earnings and cash flow in 2011 

 

as of february 10 2011 our financial commodity contracts pertaining to 2011 consisted of oil price collars oil call options gas price swaps gas basis swaps and ngl basis swaps the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that monthly nymex prices in 2011 are outside of the ranges established by the collars or differ from those established by the swaps we and the counterparties to the contracts will cashsettle the difference such settlements will either increase or decrease our revenues for the period also we will marktomarket the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2011 changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as increases or decreases to our revenues the expected ranges of our realized prices as a percentage of nymex prices which are presented earlier in this report do not include any estimates of the impact on our prices from monthly settlements or changes in the fair values of our price collars and swaps 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production and ngl content from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of gas and ngls provisions of contractual agreements and the amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes 

 

these factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that our 2011 marketing and midstream operating profit will be between 485 million and 535 million we estimate that marketing and midstream revenues will be between 1485 billion and 1760 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 1000 billion and 1225 billion 

 

production and operating expenses 

 

these expenses which include transportation costs vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties as well as the amount of repair and workover activity required additionally lease operating expenses associated with oil production particularly heavy oil production are generally higher than operating expenses associated with gas and ngl production oil gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

 

given these uncertainties we expect that our 2011 lease operating expenses will be between 178 billion and 188 billion 

 

taxes other than income taxes 

 

our taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of production taxes and ad valorem taxes that relate to our us onshore properties and are assessed by various government agencies production taxes are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by property and government jurisdiction ad valorem taxes generally are based on property values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax over time a certain property’s assessed value will increase or decrease due to changes in commodity sales prices production volumes and proved reserves therefore ad valorem taxes will generally move in the same direction as our oil gas and ngl sales but in a less predictable manner compared to production taxes additionally both production and ad valorem taxes will increase or decrease due to changes in the rates assessed by the government agencies 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our taxes other than income taxes for 2011 will be between 520 and 620 of total oil gas and ngl sales 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

our 2011 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2011 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts revisions to our yearend 2010 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2011 as well as potential carrying value reductions that result from full cost ceiling tests 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 740 per boe and 800 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2010 is expected to be between 176 billion and 190 billion 

additionally we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas fixed assets will total between 265 million and 295 million in 2011 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2011 is expected to be between 85 million and 95 million 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

 

given these limitations we estimate our ga for 2011 will be between 590 million and 630 million this estimate includes approximately 110 million of noncash sharebased compensation net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

 

interest expense 

 

future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2011 from sales of oil gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow this increases the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense other factors that affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally within our control 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had total debt of 56 billion which is exclusively fixedrate debt at an overall weighted average rate of 71 our debt includes 175 billion that is scheduled to mature on september 30 2011 we also have access to the commercial paper market and our credit lines any commercial paper or credit line borrowings would bear interest at variable rates 

 

based on the factors above we expect our 2011 interest expense to be between 300 million and 340 million the estimated interest expense is exclusive of the anticipated effects of the interest rate swap contracts presented in the “interest rate risk management” section below 

 

the 2011 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three primary components — interest related to outstanding debt fees and issuance costs and capitalized interest we expect interest expense in 2011 related to our outstanding debt including net accretion of related discounts to be between 380 million and 420 million we expect interest expense in 2011 related to facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to outstanding debt balances to be between 5 million and 15 million during 2011 we also expect to capitalize between 85 million and 95 million of interest of which 45 to 55 million relates to our continuing oil and gas activities and the remainder relates to certain corporate construction projects and our discontinued operations 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

from time to time we enter into interest rate swaps such contracts are used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility 

 

as of december 31 2010 our interest rate swaps pertaining to 2011 consisted of instruments with a total notional amount of 210 billion these consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps under the terms of the forward starting swaps we will net settle these contracts in september 2011 or sooner should we elect the net settlement amount will be based upon us paying a weightedaverage fixed rate 

of 392 and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the threemonth libor the difference between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the notional amount for the 30year period from september 30 2011 to september 30 2041 the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

our financial income tax rate in 2011 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2011 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by our united states and canadian operations due to the different tax rates of each country also certain tax deductions and credits will have a fixed impact on 2011 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced additionally significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of these tax deductions and credits on 2011 financial income tax rates 

 

given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect that our total financial income tax rate in 2011 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 0 and 10 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 20 and 30 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

north america onshore capital expenditures 

 

our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for our future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2011 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

 

given the limitations discussed above we estimate that our 2011 oil and gas development and exploration capital expenditures will be between 4500 billion and 4900 billion we estimate that our development capital will be between 3875 billion and 4175 billion development capital includes activity related to reserves classified as proved and drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation development capital also includes estimates for plugging and abandonment charges we estimate that our exploration capital will be between 625 million and 725 million exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs exploration capital also includes purchases of proved and unproved leasehold acreage in addition to the development and exploration expenditures we expect to 

capitalize between 330 million and 350 million of ga expenses and between 45 million and 55 million of interest related to our oil and gas activities 

 

in addition we expect to spend between 225 million and 300 million on our midstream assets which primarily include our oil pipelines gas processing plants and gas gathering and pipeline systems we also expect total capital for corporate activities will be between 300 million and 395 million including approximately 30 million of capitalized interest related to certain construction projects 

 

other cash uses 

 

in may 2010 our board of directors approved a 35 billion share repurchase program this program expires on december 31 2011 through february 10 2011 we had repurchased 235 million common shares for 16 billion or 6960 per share 

 

our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 016 per share quarterly dividend rate and expected share repurchases 2011 dividends are expected to approximate 264 million 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

our estimated 2011 cash uses including our capital activities are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our existing cash balances and operating cash flow supplemented with commercial paper borrowings at the beginning of 2011 we held 34 billion in cash and shortterm investments the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2011 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however if our operating cash flow were significantly less than our estimates we would access the commercial paper market also we have credit lines that we could access if deemed necessary as of february 10 2011 we had 20 billion of available credit under our credit lines 

 

another major source of liquidity in 2011 will be the proceeds from the divestiture of our assets in brazil and to a lesser extent the divestiture of our assets in angola 

 

these sources of liquidity will allow us to continue repurchasing common shares and investing in the opportunities that exist across our north america onshore portfolio of properties we expect our combined capital resources to be adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2011

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

 

commodity price risk 

 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our oil gas and ngl production through various financial transactions that hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps basis swaps and costless price collars additionally to facilitate a portion of our price swaps we have sold gas 

call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012 the key terms of our derivatives in place as of december 31 2010 are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fair values of our commodity derivatives presented in the tables above are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices at december 31 2010 a 10 increase in the forward curves associated with our gas derivative instruments would have decreased the fair value of such instruments by approximately 154 million a 10 increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivative instruments would have decreased the fair value of these instruments by approximately 142 million 

 

interest rate risk 

 

at december 31 2010 we had debt outstanding of 56 billion with fixed rates averaging 71 

 

as of december 31 2010 our interest rate swaps consisted of instruments with a total notional amount of 21 billion these consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps under the terms of the forward starting swaps we will net settle these contracts in september 2011 or sooner should we 

elect the net settlement amount will be based upon us paying a weightedaverage fixed rate of 392 and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the threemonth libor the difference between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the notional amount for the 30year period from september 30 2011 to september 30 2041 the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

the fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the federal funds rate and libor at december 31 2010 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have increased the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately 68 million 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2010 balance sheet

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in exploration development and production of natural gas and oil our oil and gas operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the united states and canada we also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the gulf of mexico and regions located offshore azerbaijan brazil and china 

 

to complement our upstream oil and gas operations we have marketing and midstream operations primarily in north america with these operations we market gas crude oil and ngls we also construct and operate pipelines storage and treating facilities and natural gas processing plants these midstream facilities are used to transport oil gas and ngls and process natural gas 

 

we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company we have been publicly held since 1988 and our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

 

strategy 

 

as an enterprise we aspire to be the premier independent natural gas and oil company in north america to achieve this we continuously strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing reserves production earnings and cash flows all on a per share basis we do this by 

 

  

over the past decade we captured an abundance of resources by carrying out this strategy we pioneered horizontal drilling in the barnett shale and extended this technique to other natural gas shale plays in the united states and canada we became proficient with steamassisted gravity drainage with our jackfish oil sands development in alberta canada we achieved key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore brazil we have more than tripled our proved oil and gas reserves since 2000 and have also assembled an extensive inventory of exploration assets representing additional unproved resources 

 

building off our past successes in november 2009 we announced plans to strategically reposition devon as a highgrowth north american onshore exploration and production company as part of this strategic repositioning we plan to bring forward the value of our offshore assets located in the gulf of mexico and countries outside north america by divesting them 

 

this repositioning is driven by our desire to unlock and accelerate the realization of the value underlying the deep inventory of opportunities we have we have assembled a valuable portfolio of offshore assets and we have a considerable inventory of premier north american onshore assets however our north american onshore assets have consistently provided us our highest riskadjusted investment returns by selling our offshore assets we can more aggressively pursue the untapped value of these north american onshore opportunities besides reducing debt the offshore divestiture proceeds are expected to provide significant funds to redeploy into our prolific north american onshore opportunities with these added funds we plan to accelerate the growth and realization of the value of our north american onshore assets 

presentation of discontinued operations 

 

as a result of the planned divestitures of our offshore assets all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore financial data and operational data such as reserves production wells and acreage provided in this document exclude amounts related to our international operations unless otherwise provided 

 

even though we are also divesting our us offshore operations these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operational data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations where appropriate we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets 

 

development of business 

 

since our first issuance of common stock to the public in 1988 we have executed strategies that have always been focused on growth and value creation for our shareholders we increased our total proved reserves from 8 mmboe at yearend 1987 to 2733 mmboe at yearend 2009 during this same time period we increased annual production from 1 mmboe in 1987 to 233 mmboe in 2009 our expansion over this time period is attributable to a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years as well as active and successful exploration and development programs in more recent years additionally our growth has provided meaningful value creation for our shareholders the growth statistics from 1987 to 2009 translate into annual per share growth rates of 11 for production and 8 for reserves 

 

as a result of this growth we have become one of the largest independent oil and gas companies in north america during 2009 we continued to build off our past successes with a number of key accomplishments including those discussed below 

 

  

construction continued throughout 2009 on a second phase of the jackfish project jackfish 2 is also sized to produce 35 mbbls of oil per day and will commence operations in 2011 we expect to file a regulatory application for a third phase of the project in the third quarter of 2010 

  

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

 

notes 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

oil natural gas and ngl marketing 

 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more or shortterm less than one year agreements regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or market sensitive prices 

 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixedprice contracts associated with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

oil marketing 

 

our oil production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of january 2010 approximately 81 of our oil production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices the remaining 19 of oil production was sold under longterm marketindexed contracts that are subject to market pricing variations 

 

natural gas marketing 

 

our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of january 2010 approximately 86 of our gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 13 of our production was committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at marketsensitive prices the remaining 1 of our gas production was sold under longterm fixedprice contracts 

 

ngl marketing 

 

our ngl production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary as of january 2010 approximately 90 of our ngl production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices the remaining 10 of ngl production was sold under shortterm fixedprice contracts 

 

marketing and midstream activities 

 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil gas and ngl production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area our midstream assets also include our 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

  

customers 

 

we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

 

the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

 

our ngl production is primarily sold to customers engaged in petrochemical refining and heavy oil blending activities pipelines railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products to market 

 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues 

 

seasonal nature of business 

 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

 

public policy and government regulation 

 

the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world laws rules regulations and other policy implementations affecting the oil and gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to public policy changes numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because public policy changes affecting the oil and gas industry are commonplace and because existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size and financial strength 

 

the following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the united states canada and other international locations in which we operate 

exploration and production regulation 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations these regulations relate to matters that include but are not limited to 

 

  

our operations also are subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the united states some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

 

certain of our us natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the bureau of land management and the minerals management service “mms” of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission also has jurisdiction over certain us offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

 

royalties and incentives in canada 

 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays tax credits and fixed rate and profitsharing royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

the provincial government of alberta enacted a new royalty regime effective january 1 2009 the new regime links royalties to price and production levels and applies to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects this regime has generally reduced our proved reserves and production in alberta as well as the related earnings and cash flows similar effects have been experienced throughout the oil and gas industry in alberta acknowledging this impact on the industry the government of alberta has announced a competitiveness review to assess the impact to the industry as a result of the royalty changes however we are uncertain whether the current regime will be modified 

 

pricing and marketing in canada 

 

any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

 

production sharing contracts 

 

some of our international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years pscs also generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions as a result at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs generally allow the government agency to retain higher fractions of revenue 

 

environmental and occupational regulations 

 

we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things 

 

  

the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems is required to be implemented for some international oil and gas operations 

 

we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures however based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however we do not maintain 100 coverage concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a violation of law 

climate change 

 

policy makers in the united states are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes however there is currently no settled scientific consensus on whether or the extent to which humanderived greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climatic change as an oil and gas company the debate on climate change is relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for develop produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases additionally the combustion of carbonbased fuels such as the oil gas and ngls we sell emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as a result some believe that combustion of carbonbased fuels contributes to climate change 

 

despite the lack of a settled scientific consensus on humanderived impacts on climate change policy makers at both the united states federal and state level have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development of “cap and trade” programs these programs generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economywide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances as a result of a gradually declining cap the number of governmentissued allowances and allowances available for trade would be reduced each year until the overall goal of greenhouse gas emission reductions is achieved 

 

because no final legislation or regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions have been enacted at this time it is not possible to estimate the costs or operational impacts we could experience to comply with new legislative or regulatory developments although we do not anticipate that we would be impacted to any greater degree than other similar oil and gas companies a stringent greenhouse gas control program could increase our cost of doing business and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that we sell however to the extent that any particular greenhouse gas program directly or indirectly encourages the use of natural gas demand for the natural gas we sell could increase 

 

the kyoto protocol was adopted by numerous countries in 1997 and implemented in 2005 the protocol requires reductions of certain emissions of greenhouse gases although the united states has not ratified the protocol certain countries in which we operate have canada ratified the protocol in april 2007 and released its regulatory framework for air emissions the canadian framework is a plan to implement mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions the mandatory reductions on greenhouse gas emissions will create additional costs for the canadian oil and gas industry including us certain provinces in canada also have implemented or are currently implementing legislation and regulations to report and reduce greenhouse gas emissions which also will carry a cost associated with compliance presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions reductions in canada or elsewhere but such expenditures could be substantial 

 

in 2006 we established our corporate climate change position and strategy key components of the strategy include initiation of energy efficiency measures tracking emerging climate change legislation and publication of a corporate greenhouse gas emission inventory we last published our emission inventory on january 2008 we will publish another emission inventory on or before march 31 2011 to comply with a reporting mandate issued by the united states environmental protection agency additionally we continue to explore energy efficiency measures and greenhouse emission reduction opportunities we also continue to monitor legislative and regulatory climate change developments such as the proposals described above 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 5400 employees we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil gas and ngls a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability 

additional discussion of our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — preparation of reserves estimates and reserves audits” 

 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons we are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries we have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur capital expenditures even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures 

 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the costs of properties available for acquisition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially 

larger than ours they also may have established strategic longterm positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

 

our operations outside north america are based primarily in azerbaijan brazil and china as noted earlier in this report we are in the process of divesting our operations outside north america however until we cease operating in these locations we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties in these areas that are more prevalent than what exist for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

 

public policy which includes laws rules and regulations can change 

 

our operations are subject to federal laws rules and regulations in the united states canada and the other countries in which we operate in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various 

states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to public policy changes numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such public policy have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability while public policy can change at any time in the future those laws and regulations outside north america to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change 

 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

 

insurance does not cover all risks 

 

exploration development production and processing of oil gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us due to changes in the insurance marketplace following hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in recent years we currently do not have coverage for any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the gulf of mexico 

 

certain of our investments are subject to risks that may affect their liquidity and value 

 

to maximize earnings on available cash balances we periodically invest in securities that we consider to be shortterm in nature and generally available for shortterm liquidity needs during 2007 we purchased assetbacked securities that have an auction rate reset feature “auction rate securities” our auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of more than 20 years however the underlying interest rates on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to 28 days therefore when we bought these securities they were generally priced and subsequently traded as shortterm investments because of the interest rate reset feature at december 31 2009 our auction rate securities totaled 115 million 

 

since february 8 2008 we have experienced difficulty selling our securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provided liquidity to these securities an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature due to continued auction failures throughout 2009 we consider these investments to be longterm in nature and generally not available for shortterm liquidity needs 

 

our auction rate securities are rated aaa — the highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and are collateralized by student loans that are substantially guaranteed by the united states government these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by problems in the global credit markets including but not limited to us subprime mortgage defaults and writedowns by major financial institutions due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios these and other related factors have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues if 

issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate our ability to liquidate these securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited under such circumstances we may record an impairment charge on these investments in the future

property overview 

 

our oil and gas operations are concentrated in various north american onshore areas in the united states and canada we also have offshore operations that are situated principally in the gulf of mexico and regions located offshore azerbaijan brazil and china as previously mentioned we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions these interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

 

we also have certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the barnett shale region in north texas these assets include approximately 3100 miles of pipeline two natural gas processing plants with 750 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator to support our continued development and growing production in the woodford shale located in southeastern oklahoma we constructed the northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008 the northridge plant has a capacity of 200 mmcf per day 

 

our midstream assets also include the access pipeline transportation system in canada this 220mile dual pipeline system extends from our jackfish operations in northern alberta to a 350 mbbls storage terminal near edmonton the dual pipeline system allows us to blend the jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the edmonton crude oil market for sale we have a 50 ownership interest in the access pipeline 

the following sections provide additional details of our oil and gas properties including information about proved reserves production wells acreage and drilling activities

preparation of reserves estimates and reserves audits 

 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations to be considered proved oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain also the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” these same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators “qualified estimators” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards 

 

the group which is led by devon’s director of reserves and economics is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates we ensure the group’s director and key members of the group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates such qualifications include any or all of the following 

 

  

the current director of the group and the group’s key members all have the qualifications listed above additionally the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the group’s director reports to our senior vice president of strategic development who reports to our president no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below the group also ensures our qualified estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

 

the group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by thirdparty consulting firms during 2009 we engaged three such firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of our proved reserves ryder scott company lp prepared the 2009 reserve estimates for all of our offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 99 of our international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2009 reserve estimates for 93 of our domestic onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants audited 91 of our canadian reserves 

set forth below is a summary of the north american reserves that were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

“prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee that consists of three independent members of our board of directors although we are not required to have a reserves committee we established ours in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee was designed to assist the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

 

the reserves committee meets at least twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following

proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves 

 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves by continent and for each significant country as of december 31 2009 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

 

 

 

  

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2009 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

proved developed reserves 

 

as presented in the previous table we had 1922 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2009 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

proved undeveloped reserves 

 

the following table presents the changes in our total proved undeveloped reserves during 2009 in mmboe 

 

 

 

during 2009 our proved undeveloped reserves increased 91 a large contributor to the increase was our 2009 drilling activities which increased our proved undeveloped reserves 316 mmboe also as a result of 2009 drilling activities we converted 81 mmboe or 19 of the 2008 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 

 

our proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2009 largely relate to our operations at jackfish and the barnett shale additionally the 2009 positive revisions due to prices largely related to jackfish at the end of 2008 none of our jackfish reserves were classified as proved due to low oil prices however as oil prices rebounded during 2009 our jackfish reserves including the reserves that were undeveloped at the end of 2008 once again became economic and were classified as proved at the end of 2009 the positive revision related to jackfish reserves was partially offset by decreases in proved undeveloped gas reserves related to certain of our north american onshore properties 

at the end of 2009 approximately 1 of our proved reserves had been classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years the majority of such reserves relate to our deepwater gulf of mexico operations where sanctioned development projects often take longer than five years to complete 

 

proved reserves cash flows 

 

the following table presents estimated cash flow information related to our december 31 2009 estimated proved reserves similar to reserves the cash flow estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

operation of properties 

 

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

 

we are the operator of 24221 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

 

title to properties 

 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

introduction 

 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be reviewed in conjunction with our “selected financial data” and “financial statements and supplementary data” our discussion and analysis relates to the following subjects 

 

 33 

 

  

overview of business 

 

devon is one of north america’s leading independent oil and gas exploration and production companies our operations are focused in the united states and canada we also own natural gas pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas making us one of north america’s larger processors of natural gas liquids 

 

as an enterprise we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing reserves production earnings and cash flows all on a per share basis we accomplish this by replenishing our reserves and production and managing other key operational elements that drive our success these items are discussed more fully below 

 

  

approximately twothirds of our planned 2010 investment in capital projects is dedicated to a foundation of lowrisk projects in our north american onshore properties the remainder of our capital has been identified for longerterm projects primarily in new unconventional natural gas plays in several us onshore regions as well as offshore activities in the gulf of mexico by deploying our capital in this manner we are able to consistently deliver costefficient drillbit growth and provide a strong source of cash flow while balancing shortterm and longterm growth targets the timing of closing the planned sales of our gulf of mexico properties will impact exactly how much of our 2010 capital is used on our gulf of mexico assets 

 

 34 

  

  

overview of 2009 results 

 

2009 was a pivotal year for us as we began repositioning devon to focus entirely on our highreturn north american onshore natural gas and oil portfolio we grew north american onshore production more than six percent in 2009 and replaced more than twice our production with the drill bit at very attractive costs the performance of these assets is reflected in our earnings which steadily increased over the last three quarters of 2009 

 

however our full year 2009 results were significantly impacted by the downward pressure in oil and natural gas prices that began in the last half of 2008 and continued throughout 2009 the henry hub natural gas index average for 2009 was 56 lower than 2008 although crude prices have improved since the end of 2008 the 2009 west texas intermediate oil index average was 38 lower than 2008 

 

the lower oil and gas prices significantly impacted our first quarter 2009 earnings which in turn impacted our full year earnings during 2009 we incurred a net loss of 25 billion or 558 per diluted share these amounts are the result of a noncash impairment of our oil and gas properties that was recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and totaled 42 billion net of income taxes substantially all of this noncash charge was the result of the drop in natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2009 

 

key measures of our performance for 2009 as well as certain operational developments are summarized below 

 

 35 

 

  

from an operational perspective we completed another successful year with the drillbit we drilled 1135 gross wells with an overall 99 rate of success this success rate enabled us to increase proved reserves by 496 million boe which was more than double our 2009 production our drilling success was driven by north american onshore development wells which represented 95 of the wells drilled 

 

besides another successful year of north american onshore drilling we had several other key operational achievements during 2009 the first phase of our 100owned jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the alberta oil sands was operational throughout 2009 as measured by production per well and steamtooil ratio jackfish is one of canada’s most successful steamassisted gravity drainage projects in late 2009 jackfish’s gross production reached 337 mbbls of oil per day the addition of four more producing wells is expected to push production to the facility’s capacity of 35 mbbls per day in early 2010 

 

we continued construction throughout 2009 on a second phase of the jackfish project jackfish 2 is also sized to produce 35 mbbls of oil per day and will commence operations in 2011 further expansion into a third phase of jackfish is planned for 2010 we expect to file a regulatory application for jackfish 3 in the third quarter of 2010 

 

elsewhere in north america we are expanding and developing five natural gas shale plays where we own a total of 16 million net acres at the barnett shale the most mature of our shale plays we pushed our total producing wells to almost 4200 at the end of 2009 and we exited the year producing just over one bcfe per day in the canawoodford shale and arkomawoodford shale we drilled a total of 108 wells increasing reserves to 120 mmboe in the haynesville shale our drilling has been focused on derisking our acreage in the greater carthage area of east texas finally at horn river we have assembled a portfolio of acreage that requires minimal drilling to hold we are in the early stages of evaluating the full potential of these leases and formulating a development plan 

 

even with the net loss we maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009 we used operating cash flow borrowings and cash on hand to fund 53 billion of capital expenditures and pay 284 million of dividends at the end of 2009 we had 10 billion of cash and 18 billion of availability under our credit lines 

 

business and industry outlook 

 

over the past decade we captured an abundance of resources we pioneered horizontal drilling in the barnett shale field in north texas and extended this technique to other natural gas shale plays in the united states and canada we became proficient with steamassisted gravity drainage with our jackfish oil sands development in alberta canada we achieved key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore brazil we have more than tripled our proved oil and gas reserves since 2000 and have also assembled an extensive inventory of exploration assets representing additional unproved resources 

 

building off our past successes in november 2009 we announced plans to strategically reposition devon as a highgrowth north american onshore exploration and production company as part of this strategic repositioning we plan to bring forward the value of our offshore assets located in the gulf of mexico and countries outside north america by divesting them 

this repositioning is driven by our desire to unlock and accelerate the realization of the value underlying the deep inventory of opportunities we have we have assembled a valuable portfolio of offshore assets and we have a considerable inventory of premier north american onshore assets however our north american onshore assets have consistently provided us our highest riskadjusted investment returns by selling our offshore assets we can more aggressively pursue the untapped value of these north american onshore opportunities 

 

we expect to receive aftertax proceeds of between 45 billion and 75 billion as we divest our us offshore and international properties in 2010 by using a portion of these proceeds to reduce debt we will further strengthen our balance sheet besides reducing debt the offshore divestiture proceeds are expected to provide significant funds to redeploy into our prolific north american onshore opportunities with these added funds we plan to accelerate the growth and realization of the value of our north american onshore assets 

 

results of operations 

 

as previously stated we are in the process of divesting our offshore assets as a result all amounts in this document related to our international operations are presented as discontinued therefore the production revenue and expense amounts presented in this “results of operations” section exclude amounts related to our international assets unless otherwise noted even though we are also divesting our us offshore operations these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules as such financial and operating data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our us offshore operations to facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures we have presented amounts related to our us offshore assets separate from those of our north american onshore assets where appropriate 

 

unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars 

 

revenues 

 

our oil gas and ngl production volumes from 2007 to 2009 are shown in the following table 

 

 37 

 

 

 

  

the following table presents the prices we realized on our production volumes from 2007 to 2009 these prices exclude any effects due to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments 

 

 38 

 

 

 

  

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales between 2007 and 2009 

 

 

 

oil sales 

 

2009 vs 2008 oil sales decreased 13 billion as a result of a 38 decrease in our realized price without hedges the average nymex west texas intermediate index price decreased 38 during the same time period accounting for the majority of the decrease in our realized price 

 

oil sales increased 258 million due to a three million barrel or 8 increase in production the increased production resulted primarily from the continued development of our jackfish thermal heavy oil project in canada 

 

2008 vs 2007 oil sales increased 894 million as a result of a 38 increase in our realized price without hedges the average nymex west texas intermediate index price increased 38 during the same time period accounting for the majority of the increase in our realized price 

 

oil sales increased 222 million due to a four million barrel or 10 increase in production production from our canadian operations increased approximately six million barrels in 2008 as a result of first oil sales 

at jackfish and heavy oil development activity at lloydminster this increase was partially offset by the deferral of 05 million barrels of oil production from our us offshore properties due to hurricanes 

 

gas sales 

 

2009 vs 2008 gas sales decreased 43 billion as a result of a 57 decrease in our realized price without hedges this decrease was largely due to decreases in the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

 

a 28 bcf or 3 increase in production during 2009 caused gas sales to increase by 222 million our north american onshore properties contributed 40 bcf of higher volumes this increase included 25 bcf of higher production in canada due to a decline in canadian government royalties resulting largely from lower gas prices the remainder of the north american onshore growth resulted from new drilling and development that exceeded natural production declines primarily in the barnett shale field in north texas these increases were partially offset by 12 bcf of lower production from our us offshore properties largely resulting from natural production declines 

 

2008 vs 2007 gas sales increased 16 billion as a result of a 29 increase in our realized price without hedges this increase was largely due to increases in the north american regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

 

a 76 bcf or 9 increase in production during 2008 caused gas sales to increase by 459 million our north american onshore properties contributed 96 bcf to our growth as a result of new drilling and development that exceeded natural production declines this increase was led by our drilling and development program in the barnett shale which contributed 83 bcf to the gas production increase this increase and the effect of new drilling and development in our other north american onshore properties were partially offset by natural production declines and the deferral of seven bcf of production in our us offshore properties in 2008 due to hurricanes 

 

ngl sales 

 

2009 vs 2008 ngl sales decreased 585 million as a result of a 44 decrease in our realized price without hedges this decrease was largely due to decreases in the regional index prices upon which our us onshore ngl sales are based ngl sales increased 89 million in 2009 due to a two million barrel or 7 increase in production the increase in production is primarily due to drilling and development in the barnett shale 

 

2008 vs 2007 ngl sales increased 178 million as a result of a 17 increase in our realized price without hedges this increase was largely due to increases in the regional index prices upon which our us onshore ngl sales are based ngl sales increased 95 million in 2008 due to a two million barrel or 10 increase in production the increase in production is primarily due to barnett shale drilling and development 

net gain loss on oil and gas derivative financial instruments 

 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil and gas derivative financial instruments from 2007 to 2009 the first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements from 2007 to 2009 the prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our oil and gas derivative financial instruments include price swaps basis swaps and costless price collars for the price swaps we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty for the basis swaps we receive a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty the price collars set a floor and ceiling price if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the 

floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we cashsettle the difference with the counterparty to the collars cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to our price swaps and collars 

 

in addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments in each reporting period we estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments based on the amount of volumes subject to our gas price swaps and collars at december 31 2009 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have increased our 2009 unrealized losses for our gas derivative financial instruments by approximately 264 million a 10 increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivative financial instruments would have increased our 2009 unrealized losses by approximately 108 million another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility 

 

counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with twelve separate counterparties additionally our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade the marktomarket exposure threshold above which collateral must be posted decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2009 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

during 2009 the fair value of our oil and gas derivative financial instruments dropped by 121 million this reduction largely resulted from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains on our gas price collar contracts which was expected as the contracts settled throughout 2009 and expired on december 31 2009 this reduction as well as the reduction related to our oil price collars were partially offset by unrealized gains on gas swap contracts that we entered into during 2009 and will be settled throughout 2010 

 

during 2008 the fair value of our gas derivative financial instruments increased by 243 million which was largely due to a decrease in the inside ferc henry hub forward curve 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

the changes in marketing and midstream revenues operating costs and expenses and the resulting operating profit between 2007 and 2009 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

2009 vs 2008 marketing and midstream revenues decreased 758 million and operating costs and expenses decreased 589 million causing operating profit to decrease 169 million both revenues and 

expenses decreased primarily due to lower natural gas and ngl prices partially offset by higher ngl production and gas pipeline throughput 

 

2008 vs 2007 marketing and midstream revenues increased 556 million and operating costs and expenses increased 394 million causing operating profit to increase 162 million both revenues and expenses increased primarily due to higher natural gas and ngl prices and increased gas pipeline throughput 

 

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

the changes in loe between 2007 and 2009 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

2009 vs 2008 loe decreased 181 million in 2009 loe dropped 182 million due to declining costs for fuel materials equipment and personnel as well as declines in maintenance and well workover projects such declines largely resulted from decreasing demand for field services due to lower oil and gas prices changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar reduced loe 49 million additionally loe decreased 31 million as a result of hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our us offshore facilities and transportation systems these factors were also the main contributors to the decrease in loe per boe on our north american onshore properties production growth at our largescale jackfish project also contributed to a decrease in loe per boe as jackfish production approached the facility’s capacity during 2009 its perunit costs declined contributing to lower overall loe per boe the remainder of our 4 production growth added 81 million to loe during 2009 

 

2008 vs 2007 loe increased 319 million in 2008 the largest individual contributor to this increase as well as the increase in loe per boe was higher perunit costs associated with the new thermal heavy oil production at jackfish in 2008 when largescale projects such as jackfish are in the early phases of production perunit operating costs are normally higher than the perunit costs for our overall portfolio of producing properties loe also increased 144 million due to our 9 growth in production additionally loe increased 31 million due to hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our us offshore facilities and transportation systems these hurricane damages also contributed to the increase in loe per boe 

taxes other than income taxes 

 

taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of production taxes and ad valorem taxes assessed by various government agencies on our us onshore properties production taxes are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by property and government jurisdiction ad valorem taxes generally are based on property values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax the following table details the changes in our taxes other than income taxes between 2007 and 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

2009 vs 2008 production taxes decreased 174 million in 2009 this decrease was largely due to lower us onshore revenues as well as an increase in tax credits associated with certain properties in the state of texas ad valorem taxes increased 13 million primarily due to higher assessed oil and gas property and equipment values 

 

2008 vs 2007 production taxes increased 90 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase in our us onshore revenues ad valorem taxes increased 27 million primarily due to higher assessed oil and gas property and equipment values 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties “dda” 

 

dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents our capitalized investment net of accumulated dda and reductions of carrying value plus future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves generally when reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however when the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

 

the changes in our production volumes dda rate per unit and dda of oil and gas properties between 2007 and 2009 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 44 

 

the following table details the changes in dda of oil and gas properties between 2007 and 2009 due to the changes in production volumes and dda rate presented in the table above 

 

 

 

2009 vs 2008 oil and gas property related dda decreased 12 billion due to a 40 decrease in the dda rate the largest contributors to the rate decrease were reductions of the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008 these reductions totaled 163 billion and resulted from full cost ceiling limitations in the united states and canada in addition the effects of changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar also contributed to the rate decrease these factors were partially offset by the effects of costs incurred and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2009 drilling activities partially offsetting the impact from the lower 2009 dda rate was our 4 production increase which caused oil and gas property related dda expense to increase 130 million 

 

our 2009 dda rate reflects our adoption of the sec’s modernization of oil and gas reporting  the impact of adopting the sec’s new rules at the end of 2009 had virtually no impact on our 2009 dda rate 

 

2008 vs 2007 oil and gas property related dda increased 312 million due to a 12 increase in the dda rate the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2008 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors that contributed to the rate increase were reductions in reserve estimates due to lower 2008 yearend commodity prices and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2008 drilling activities in addition to the impact from the higher 2008 rate the 9 production increase caused oil and gas property related dda expense to increase 224 million 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially offset by two components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration 

and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

 

 

 

 

  

2009 vs 2008 gross ga increased 4 million this increase was due to approximately 60 million of higher costs for employee compensation and benefits mostly offset by the effects of our 2009 reduced spending initiatives for certain discretionary cost categories 

 

employee cost increases in 2009 included an additional 57 million of severance costs this increase was primarily due to gulf of mexico employees that were impacted by the integration of our gulf of mexico and international operations into one offshore unit in the second quarter of 2009 and other employee departures during 2009 additionally postretirement benefits costs increased approximately 50 million the increases in employee costs were partially offset by a 27 million decrease due to accelerated sharebased compensation expense recognized in 2008 as discussed below 

 

2008 vs 2007 gross ga increased 200 million the largest contributors to the increase were higher employee compensation and benefits costs these cost increases which were largely related to our growth and industry inflation during most of 2008 caused gross ga to increase 164 million of this increase 65 million related to higher stock compensation 

 

stock compensation increased 43 million in 2008 due to a modification of the sharebased compensation arrangements for certain executives the modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who meet certain yearsofservice and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding sharebased grants as a condition to receiving the benefits of these modifications the executives must agree not to use or disclose devon’s confidential information and not to solicit devon’s employees and customers the executives are required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in each subsequent year until all grants have vested 

 

although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of the executives’ grants it does accelerate the expense recognition as executives approach the yearsofservice and age criteria when the modification was made in 2008 certain executives had already met the yearsofservice and age criteria as a result we recognized 27 million of sharebased compensation expense in the second quarter of 2008 related to this modification in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized an additional 16 million of stock compensation for grants made to these executives the additional expenses would have been recognized in future reporting periods if the modification had not been made and the executives continued their employment at devon 

 

the higher employee compensation and benefits costs exclusive of the accelerated stock compensation expense were also the primary factors that caused the 60 million increase in capitalized ga in 2008 

 

restructuring costs 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recognized 153 million of estimated employee severance costs associated with the planned divestitures of our offshore assets that was announced in november 2009 this amount was based on our estimates of the number of employees that will ultimately be impacted by the divestitures and includes 63 million related to accelerated vesting of sharebased grants of the 153 million 

total 105 million relates to our us offshore operations and the remainder relates to our international discontinued operations 

 

as of the date of this report only one of the properties we intend to sell had actually been sold furthermore the vast majority of employees will not be impacted by the divestitures until the properties are sold therefore our estimate of employee severance costs recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009 was based upon certain key estimates that could change as properties are sold these estimates include the number of impacted employees the number of employees offered comparable positions with the buyers and the date of separation for impacted employees if our estimate of the number of impacted employees were to increase 10 our estimate of employee severance costs would increase approximately 10 million if our estimate of the number of employees offered comparable positions with the buyers were to decrease by 10 our estimate of employee severance costs would increase approximately 15 million additionally if the date of separation were to occur one month after our current estimates our estimate of employee severance costs would increase approximately 2 million 

 

interest expense 

 

the following table includes the components of interest expense between 2007 and 2009 

 

 

 

2009 vs 2008 interest based on debt outstanding increased 11 million from 2008 to 2009 this increase was primarily due to interest paid on the 500 million of 5625 senior unsecured notes and 700 million of 630 senior unsecured notes that we issued in january 2009 this was partially offset by lower interest resulting from the retirement of our exchangeable debentures during the third quarter of 2008 and lower interest rates on our floatingrate commercial paper borrowings 

 

capitalized interest decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the sales of our west african exploration and development properties in 2008 and the completion of the access pipeline transportation system in canada in the second quarter of 2008 

 

2008 vs 2007 interest based on debt outstanding decreased 82 million from 2007 to 2008 this decrease was largely due to lower average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in 2008 than in 2007 the decrease in borrowings resulted largely from the use of proceeds from our west african divestiture program and cash flow from operations to repay all commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in the second quarter of 2008 additionally we retired debentures with a face value of 652 million during 2008 primarily during the third quarter 

 

capitalized interest increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher cumulative costs related to largescale development projects in the gulf of mexico partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from the completion of the access pipeline in the second quarter of 2008 

change in fair value of other financial instruments 

 

the details of the changes in fair value of other financial instruments between 2007 and 2009 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

interest rate swaps 

 

we recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps each reporting period we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers in 2009 and 2008 we recorded unrealized gains of 66 million and 104 million respectively as a result of changes in interest rates also during 2009 and 2008 we received cash settlements totaling 40 million and 1 million respectively from counterparties to settle our interest rate swaps there were no cash settlements in 2007 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by a third party based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate swaps at december 31 2009 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have increased our 2009 unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by approximately 46 million 

 

similar to our commodity derivative contracts counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with several counterparties our interest rate derivative contracts are held with seven separate counterparties additionally our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade the marktomarket exposure threshold above which collateral must be posted decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of december 31 2009 

 

chevron common stock and related embedded option 

 

until october 31 2008 we owned 142 million shares of chevron common stock and recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of this investment on october 31 2008 we exchanged these shares of chevron common stock for chevron’s interest in the drunkard’s wash properties located in eastcentral utah and 280 million in cash in accordance with the terms of the exchange the fair value of our investment in the chevron shares was estimated to be 6771 per share on the exchange date prior to the exchange of these shares we calculated the fair value of our investment in chevron common stock using chevron’s published market price 

 

we also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron common stock the embedded option was not actively traded in an established market therefore we estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for trades occurring near the valuation date 

the loss during 2008 on our investment in chevron common stock was directly attributable to a 2562 per share decrease in the estimated fair value while we owned chevron’s common stock during the year the gain on the embedded option during 2008 was directly attributable to the change in fair value of the chevron common stock from january 1 2008 to the maturity date of august 15 2008 the gain on our investment in chevron common stock and loss on the embedded option during 2007 were directly attributable to a 1980 increase in the price per share of chevron’s common stock during 2007 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

during 2009 and 2008 we reduced the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

 

 

the 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the 2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter the reductions resulted from significant decreases in each country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately preceding quarter the lower united states ceiling value in the first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of declining natural gas prices subsequent to december 31 2008 the lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008 largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil gas and ngl prices compared to september 30 2008 

 

to demonstrate these declines the march 31 2009 december 31 2008 and september 30 2008 weighted average wellhead prices are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

 

na not applicable 

 

the march 31 2009 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4966 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 363 per mmbtu for gas the december 31 2008 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4460 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 571 per mmbtu for gas the september 30 2008 wellhead prices in the table compare to the nymex cash price of 10064 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 712 per mmbtu for gas 

other income 

 

the following table includes the components of other income between 2007 and 2009 

 

 

 

interest and dividend income decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to a decrease in dividends received on our previously owned investment in chevron common stock and a decrease in interest received on cash equivalents due to lower rates and balances interest and dividend income increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher cash balances partially offset by lower interest rates and a decrease in dividends received on our investment in chevron common stock 

 

in 1995 the united states congress passed the deep water royalty relief act the intent of this legislation was to encourage deep water exploration in the gulf of mexico by providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain federal leases deep water leases issued in certain years by the minerals management service the “mms” have contained price thresholds such that if the market prices for oil or gas exceeded the thresholds for a given year royalty relief would not be granted for that year 

 

in october 2007 a federal district court ruled in favor of a plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price thresholds in deep water leases additionally in january 2009 a federal appellate court upheld this district court ruling this judgment was later appealed to the united states supreme court which in october 2009 declined to review the appellate court’s ruling the supreme court’s decision ended the mms’s judicial course to enforce the price thresholds 

 

prior to september 30 2009 we had 84 million accrued for potential royalties on various deep water leases based upon the supreme court’s decision we reduced to zero the 84 million loss contingency accrual in the third quarter of 2009 

 

in 2008 we recognized 162 million of excess insurance recoveries for damages suffered in 2005 related to hurricanes that struck the gulf of mexico the excess recoveries resulted from business interruption claims on policies that were in effect when the 2005 hurricanes occurred 

income taxes 

 

the following table presents our total income tax benefit expense related to continuing operations and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate for each of the past three years the primary factors causing our effective rates to vary from 2007 to 2009 and differ from the us statutory rate are discussed below 

 

 

 

for 2008 our effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate largely due to two related factors first during 2008 we repatriated 26 billion from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states second we made certain tax policy election changes in the second quarter of 2008 to minimize the taxes we otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations as well as the taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in west africa as a result of the repatriation and tax policy election changes we recognized additional tax expense of 312 million during 2008 of the 312 million 295 million was recognized as current income tax expense and 17 million was recognized as deferred tax expense excluding the 312 million of additional tax expense our effective income tax benefit rate would have been 34 for 2008 

 

in 2007 deferred income taxes were reduced 261 million due to a canadian statutory rate reduction that was enacted in that year 

 

earnings from discontinued operations 

 

for all years presented in the following tables our discontinued operations include amounts related to our assets in azerbaijan brazil china and other minor international properties that we are in the process of divesting additionally during 2007 and 2008 our discontinued operations included amounts related to our assets in egypt and west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the 

region until they were sold following are the components of earnings from discontinued operations between 2007 and 2009 

 

 

 

our african sales generated total proceeds of 30 billion the following table presents the gains on the african divestiture transactions by year 

 

 

 

2009 vs 2008 earnings from discontinued operations decreased 617 million in 2009 our discontinued earnings were impacted by several factors first operating revenues declined largely due to a 36 decrease in the price realized on our production which was driven by a decline in crude oil index prices second both operating revenues and expenses declined due to divestitures that closed in 2008 discontinued earnings also decreased due to 48 million of restructuring costs that relate to our planned divestitures and were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009 these costs consist of employee severance costs earnings also decreased 752 million in 2009 due to larger gains recognized on west african asset divestitures in 2008 

 

partially offsetting these decreased earnings in 2009 was the larger reduction of carrying value recognized in 2008 compared to 2009 the reductions largely consisted of full cost ceiling limitations related to our assets in brazil that were caused by a decline in oil prices 

 

2008 vs 2007 earnings from discontinued operations decreased 230 million in 2008 our earnings were impacted by several factors first operating revenues and expenses including the related production volumes decreased largely due to the timing of our 2008 and 2007 divestitures partially offset by the effects of first production in brazil discontinued earnings also decreased due to the net effect of reductions in carrying value recognized in 2008 and 2007 which largely related to our assets in brazil discontinued earnings increased 679 million in 2008 due to the larger african divestiture gains in 2008 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

the following discussion of capital resources uses and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from 2007 to 2009 the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis therefore these amounts differ from capital expenditure amounts that include accruals and are referred to elsewhere in this document additional discussion of these items follows the table 

 

 

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be our primary source of capital and liquidity in 2009 changes in operating cash flow from our continuing operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net earnings with the exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as dda financial instrument fair value changes property impairments and deferred income taxes as a result our operating cash flow decreased 50 during 2009 primarily due to the significant decrease in oil gas and ngl sales net of commodity hedge settlements as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

 

during 2009 our operating cash flow funded approximately 87 of our cash payments for capital expenditures commercial paper borrowings were used to fund the remainder of our cashbased capital expenditures during 2008 and 2007 our capital expenditures were primarily funded by our operating cash flow and preexisting cash balances 

 

other sources of cash — continuing and discontinued operations 

 

as needed we supplement our operating cash flow with cash on hand and access to our available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program we may also issue longterm debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities additionally we sometimes acquire shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances as needed we may reduce our investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow 

 

in january 2009 we issued 500 million of 5625 senior unsecured notes due january 15 2014 and 700 million of 630 senior unsecured notes due january 15 2019 the net proceeds received of 1187 billion after discounts and issuance costs were used primarily to repay devon’s 1005 billion of outstanding commercial paper as of december 31 2008 

 

subsequent to the 10 billion commercial paper repayment in january 2009 we utilized additional commercial paper borrowings of 14 billion to fund capital expenditure and dividend payments in excess of our operating cash flow during 2009 

 

during 2008 we reduced our shortterm investment balances by 250 million we also received 280 million from the exchange of our investment in chevron common stock 117 million from the sale of nonoil and gas property and equipment and 116 million from stock option exercises another significant source of cash was our african divestiture program in 2008 we received 26 billion in proceeds 19 billion net of income taxes and purchase price adjustments from sales of assets located in equatorial guinea and other west african countries also in conjunction with these asset sales we repatriated an additional 26 billion of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states we used these combined sources of cash in 2008 to fund debt repayments common stock repurchases redemptions of preferred stock and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

during 2007 we borrowed 15 billion under our unsecured revolving line of credit and reduced our shortterm investment balances by 202 million we also received 341 million of proceeds from the sale of our egyptian operations these sources of cash were used primarily to fund net commercial paper repayments longterm debt repayments common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred stock 

capital expenditures 

 

following are the components of our capital expenditures for the years ended 2009 2008 and 2007 the amounts in the table below reflect cash payments for capital expenditures including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred capital expenditures actually incurred during 2009 2008 and 2007 were approximately 47 billion 100 billion and 59 billion respectively 

 

 

 

our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 43 billion 82 billion and 52 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in capital expenditures from 2008 to 2009 was due to decreased drilling activities in most of our operating areas in response to lower commodity prices in 2009 compared to recent years the 2008 capital expenditures include 26 billion related to acquisitions of properties in texas louisiana oklahoma and canada excluding the effect of the 2008 acquisitions the increase in capital expenditures from 2007 to 2008 was due to increased drilling activities in the barnett shale gulf of mexico carthage groesbeck and washakie areas of the united states and the lloydminster and jackfish projects in canada expenditures in the first half of 2008 also increased due to inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services 

 

our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines these midstream facilities exist primarily to support our oil and gas development operations the majority of our midstream expenditures from 2007 to 2009 were related to development activities in the barnett shale the arkomawoodford shale in southeastern oklahoma the canawoodford shale in western oklahoma and jackfish in canada 

 

net repayments of debt 

 

debt repayments in 2009 include the retirement of 177 million of 10125 notes upon maturity in the fourth quarter 

 

during 2008 we repaid 15 billion in outstanding credit facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the sales of assets under our african divestiture program also during 2008 virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares of chevron common stock owned by us the debentures matured on august 15 2008 in lieu of delivering our shares of chevron common stock we exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders cash totaling 10 billion this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 652 million and a 379 million payment of the related embedded derivative option 

 

during 2007 we repaid the 400 million 4375 notes which matured on october 1 2007 also during 2007 certain holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares of chevron common stock prior to the debentures’ august 15 2008 maturity date in lieu of delivering shares of chevron common stock we exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders an amount of cash equal to the market value of chevron common stock we paid 167 million in cash to exchangeable 

debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 105 million and a 62 million payment of the related embedded derivative option 

 

repurchases of common stock 

 

during 2008 and 2007 we repurchased 106 million shares at a total cost of 10 billion or an average of 9376 per share under approved repurchase programs no shares were repurchased in 2009 the following table summarizes our repurchases under approved plans during 2008 and 2007 amounts and shares in millions both programs expired on december 31 2009 

 

 

 

redemption of preferred stock 

 

on june 20 2008 we redeemed all 15 million outstanding shares of our 649 series a cumulative preferred stock each share of preferred stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of 100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date 

 

dividends 

 

our common stock dividends were 284 million or a quarterly rate of 016 per share in both 2009 and 2008 and 249 million or a quarterly rate of 014 in 2007 common dividends increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the higher quarterly dividend rates 

 

we also paid 5 million of preferred stock dividends in 2008 and 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2007 the decrease in the preferred dividends in 2008 was due to the redemption of our preferred stock in the second quarter of 2008 

 

liquidity 

 

historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities as well as our automatically effective registration statement on form s3asr filed with the sec this registration statement can be used to offer shortterm and longterm debt securities in 2010 another major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our offshore operations which we estimate will range from 45 billion to 75 billion after taxes we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

 

operating cash flow 

 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls we produce due to sharp declines in commodity prices our operating cash flow decreased approximately 50 to 47 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 in spite of the recent commodity price declines we expect operating cash flow will continue to be a primary source of liquidity and we will need to manage our capital expenditures and other cash uses accordingly however as a result of depressed commodity prices debt borrowings have been a significant source of liquidity during 2009 during 2009 our net borrowings of longterm debt and commercial paper totaled 16 billion we anticipate utilizing commercial paper borrowings as needed to supplement operating cash flow in 2010 as the offshore divestiture transactions close we anticipate using a portion of the proceeds to repay our commercial paper borrowings 

commodity prices  — prices for oil gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in oil gas and ngl prices and are beyond our control we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2010 

 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various price swap fixedprice physical delivery and price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2010 production as of february 15 2010 approximately 65 of our estimated 2010 oil production is subject to price collars and approximately 54 of our estimated 2010 gas production is subject to price collars price swaps and fixedprice physicals we also have basis swaps associated with 02 bcf per day of our 2010 gas production 

 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases as experienced in recent years can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices such as what we are currently experiencing 

 

interest rates  — our operating cash flow can also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as of february 15 2010 we had total debt of 71 billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 593 to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility we have interest rate swap instruments with a total notional amount of 185 billion these consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps under the terms of the forward starting swaps we will net settle these contracts in september 2011 or sooner should we elect based upon us paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating rate including the effects of these swaps the weightedaverage interest rate related to our fixedrate debt was 536 as of february 15 2010 

 

credit losses  — our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate we are also exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as discussed previously in this report 

 

the recent deterioration of the global financial and capital markets combined with the drop in commodity prices has increased our credit risk exposure however we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions posting of letters of credit prepayment requirements and collateral posting requirements 

 

credit availability 

 

we have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which we can access to provide liquidity 

 

we have a 265 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the maturity date for 215 billion of the senior credit facility is april 7 2013 the maturity date for the remaining 05 billion is april 7 2012 all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders the senior credit facility includes a revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million 

 

amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as february 15 2010 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility 

 

we also have a 700 million 364day syndicated unsecured revolving senior credit facility the “shortterm facility” that matures on november 2 2010 on the maturity date all amounts outstanding will be due 

and payable at that time amounts borrowed under the shortterm facility bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months such rates are generally based on libor or the prime rate as of february 15 2010 there were no borrowings under the shortterm facility 

 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 285 billion also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility or the shortterm facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of february 15 2010 we had 13 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 025 

 

the senior credit facility and shortterm facility contain only one material financial covenant this covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2009 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 205 

 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility and shortterm facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facilities include covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

 

the following schedule summarizes the capacity of our credit facilities by maturity date as well as our available capacity as of february 15 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

debt ratings 

 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by both fitch and standard  poor’s and baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 35 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 45 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2009 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

 

capital expenditures 

 

our 2010 capital expenditures are expected to range from 60 billion to 68 billion including amounts related to our discontinued operations to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2010 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2010 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity the amount and timing of the planned offshore asset divestitures in 2010 could also result in acceleration of capital spending on our north american onshore opportunities based upon current price expectations for 2010 and the commodity hedging contracts we have in place we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2010 capital expenditures 

 

common stock repurchase programs 

 

all of our common stock repurchase programs expired on december 31 2009 none of our programs were extended to 2010 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 is provided in the following table

funded status — as compared to the projected benefit obligation our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 448 million and 501 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 

respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2009 changes to our underfunded status is included in note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 448 million underfunded status at the end of 2009 215 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans that have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2009 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 39 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

as compared to the accumulated benefit obligation our qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 164 million at december 31 2009 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels 

 

our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’ assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits earned by the participants as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the pension protection act while we did have investment gains in 2009 the investment losses experienced during 2008 significantly reduced the value of our plans’ assets we estimate we will contribute approximately 25 million to our qualified pension plans during 2010 however actual contributions may be different than this amount 

 

our funding policy regarding the nonqualified defined benefit plans is to supplement as needed the amounts accumulated in the related trusts with available cash and cash equivalents 

 

pension estimate assumptions — our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 119 million 61 million and 41 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 85 million in 2010 should our actual 2010 contributions to qualified and nonqualified plans vary significantly from our current estimate of 34 million our actual 2010 pension expense could vary from this estimate 

 

the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

 

we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 718 and 840 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets at december 31 2009 the target allocations for plan assets were 475 for equity securities 40 for fixedincome securities and 125 for other investment types equity securities consist of investments in large capitalization and small capitalization companies both domestic and international fixedincome securities include corporate bonds of investmentgrade companies from diverse industries united states treasury obligations and assetbacked securities other investment types include shortterm investment funds and a hedge fund of funds we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points would increase the expected 2010 pension expense by 5 million 

 

we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 600 at december 31 2009 and 2008 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled considering the expected timing of future cash flows related to the plans this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our pension liability at december 31 2009 by 32 million and increase estimated 2010 pension expense by 4 million 

 

at december 31 2009 we had net actuarial losses of 334 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to investment losses on plan assets in 2008 reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages we estimate that approximately 27 million and 23 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2010 and 2011 respectively the 27 million estimated to be recognized in 2010 is a component of the total estimated 2010 pension expense of 85 million referred to earlier in this section 

 

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

 

contingencies and legal matters 

 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

 

the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

full cost ceiling calculations 

 

policy description 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates 

are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 22 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the amount of our reserves that are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants 

 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 2 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the 12month period prior to the end of each quarterly period costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment this adjustment requires little judgment as the calculated average price is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges none of our outstanding derivative contracts at december 31 2009 qualified for hedge accounting treatment 

 

because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and for any particular 12month period can be either higher or lower than our longterm price forecast which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns 

 

derivative financial instruments 

 

policy description 

 

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production that hedge the future prices received these instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas price volatility our oil and gas derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps basis swaps and costless price collars additionally we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility under the terms of certain of our interestrate swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount the remainder of our swaps represent forward starting swaps under which we will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate on a total notional amount 

 

all derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met if such criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity until the hedged transaction occurs the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations if such criteria are met for fair value hedges the change in the fair value is recorded in the statement of operations with an 

offsetting amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item cash settlements with counterparties to our derivative financial instruments also increase or decrease earnings at the time of the settlement 

 

a derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business combination or other transaction that includes derivative contracts additionally we must document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the instrument we must also assess both at the instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the hedged item for derivative financial instruments held during 2009 2008 and 2007 we chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify our derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

 

we periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties andor brokers 

 

in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with twelve separate counterparties and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with seven separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment grade” the marktomarket exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2009 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our results of operations generally changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results 

that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

business combinations 

 

policy description 

 

from our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003 we grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting current accounting pronouncements require the purchase method to be used to account for any future acquisitions 

 

under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

 

generally in our business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that we assume in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not 

required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

 

except for the 2002 acquisition of mitchell energy  development corp our mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

 

the mitchell midstream assets primarily serve gas producing properties that we also acquired from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

 

in addition to the valuation methods described above we perform other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

 

in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination we compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently we compare these comparable transaction multiples to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

 

while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it is a noncash charge but it would adversely affect results of operations as discussed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital resources uses and liquidity” in calculating our debttocapitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years our annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged less than 2 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

 

valuation of goodwill 

 

policy description 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment at least annually the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value including goodwill then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the annual impairment test which we conduct as of october 31 each year requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment at october 31 2009 the fair values of our united states and canadian reporting units were more than double their related carrying values this excess largely results from the reductions of carrying value that we recognized in 2008 and 2009 due to full cost ceiling limitations which are not representative of the fair values of our oil and gas properties excluding the effects of these reductions the fair values of our united states and canadian reporting units exceeded the carrying values by approximately 40 and 80 respectively 

 

generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

 

forwardlooking estimates 

 

we are providing our 2010 forwardlooking estimates in the following discussion these estimates are based on our examination of historical operating trends the information used to prepare our december 31 2009 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties the forwardlooking estimates in this discussion were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil gas and ngls during 2010 will be substantially similar to those that existed in 2009 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using an estimated average 2010 exchange rate of 095 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

 

we plan to strategically reposition devon by divesting our us offshore and international assets we have entered into agreements to sell our interests in the cascade jack and st malo properties in the gulf of 

mexico the following estimates assume these transactions close on the expected dates during the first quarter of 2010 although we expect to complete the remainder of the divestitures throughout 2010 all estimates presented assume the remaining divestitures close at the end of 2010 

 

operating items 

 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

set forth below are our estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2010 we estimate that our combined oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 231 to 235 mmboe the following estimates for oil gas and ngl production are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total production 

 

 

 

oil and gas prices 

 

we expect our 2010 average prices for the oil and gas production from each of our operating areas to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the expected ranges for prices are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the financial contracts presented in the “commodity price risk management” section below 

 

the nymex price for oil is determined using the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma the nymex price for gas is determined using the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

 

 

 

commodity price risk management 

 

from time to time we enter into nymex related financial commodity collar price swap and basis swap contracts such contracts are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas price volatility although these financial contracts do not relate to specific production from our operating areas they will affect our overall revenues earnings and cash flow in 2010 

 

as of february 15 2010 our financial commodity contracts pertaining to 2010 consisted of oil and gas price collars gas price swaps and gas basis swaps the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that monthly nymex prices or differentials on certain regional indexes in 2010 are outside of the ranges established by the collars or differ from those established by the swaps we and the counterparties to the contracts will cashsettle the difference such settlements will either increase or decrease our revenues for the period also we will marktomarket the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2010 changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as increases or decreases to our revenues the expected ranges of our realized prices as a percentage of nymex prices which are presented earlier in this report do not include any estimates of the impact on our prices from monthly settlements or changes in the fair values of our price collars and swaps 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of gas and ngls provisions of contractual agreements and the amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes 

 

these factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that our 2010 marketing and midstream operating profit will be between 450 million and 525 million we estimate that marketing and midstream revenues will be between 1850 billion and 2125 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 1400 billion and 1600 billion 

 

lease operating expenses 

 

these expenses which include transportation costs vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties the amount of repair and workover activity required oil gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

given these uncertainties we expect that our 2010 lease operating expenses will be between 174 billion and 190 billion this estimated range includes 158 billion to 172 billion related to our north american onshore business and 016 to 018 billion associated with our us offshore operations 

 

taxes other than income taxes 

 

our taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of production taxes and ad valorem taxes that relate to our us onshore properties and are assessed by various government agencies production taxes are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by property and government jurisdiction ad valorem taxes generally are based on property values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax over time a certain property’s assessed value will increase or decrease due to changes in commodity sales prices production volumes and proved reserves therefore ad valorem taxes will generally move in the same direction as our oil gas and ngl sales but in a less predictable manner compared to production taxes additionally both production and ad valorem taxes will increase or decrease due to changes in the rates assessed by the government agencies 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our taxes other than income taxes for 2010 will be between 450 and 550 of total oil gas and ngl sales we estimate our 2010 taxes other than income taxes for our north american onshore operations will range from 475 to 575 of revenues we estimate the us offshore rates will range from 100 to 200 of revenues 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

our 2010 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2010 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts revisions to our yearend 2009 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2010 as well as reductions of carrying value resulting from full cost ceiling tests 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 760 per boe and 810 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2010 is expected to be between 177 billion and 189 billion 

 

for our north american onshore assets we estimate the dda rate will range from 765 to 815 per boe resulting in estimated dda expense of 169 billion to 180 billion our us offshore dda rate is estimated to be between 675 and 725 per boe resulting in estimated dda expense of 008 billion to 009 billion 

 

additionally we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets will total between 270 million and 300 million in 2010 this estimate relates entirely to our north american onshore assets 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2010 is expected to be between 95 million and 105 million this estimated range includes 70 million to 80 million related to our north american onshore business and 25 million associated with our us offshore operations 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant 

variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

 

given these limitations we estimate our ga for 2010 will be between 580 million and 620 million this estimate includes approximately 115 million of noncash sharebased compensation net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

 

restructuring costs 

 

in conjunction with the planned 2010 asset divestitures we estimate we will incur certain onetime restructuring costs totaling between 203 million and 273 million such costs estimates consist of employee severance and termination costs contract termination costs and other associated costs we recognized 153 million of employee severance costs during the fourth quarter of 2009 we expect the majority of the remaining restructuring costs including any revisions to the fourth quarter 2009 employee severance costs will be recognized during 2010 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

due to the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict whether we will incur full cost writedowns in 2010 

 

interest expense 

 

future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2010 from sales of oil gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow this increases the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense other factors that affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally within our control 

 

as of february 15 2010 we had total debt of 71 billion this included 58 billion of fixedrate debt and 13 billion of variablerate commercial paper borrowings the fixedrate debt bears interest at an overall weighted average rate of 72 the commercial paper borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of february 15 2010 the weighted average variable rate for our commercial paper borrowings was 025 additionally any future borrowings under our credit facilities would bear interest at various fixedrate options for periods up to twelve months and are generally less than the prime rate 

 

based on the factors above we expect our 2010 interest expense to be between 325 million and 365 million the estimated interest expense is exclusive of the anticipated effects of the interest rate swap contracts presented in the “interest rate risk management” section below 

 

the 2010 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three primary components — interest related to outstanding debt fees and issuance costs and capitalized interest we expect the interest expense in 2010 related to our fixedrate and floatingrate debt including net accretion of related discounts to be between 395 million and 435 million we expect the interest expense in 2010 related to facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to outstanding debt balances to be between 10 million and 20 million we also expect to capitalize between 80 million and 90 million of interest during 2010

from time to time we enter into interest rate swaps such contracts are used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility 

as of february 15 2010 our interest rate swaps pertaining to 2010 consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

our financial income tax rate in 2010 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2010 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by our united states and canadian operations due to the different tax rates of each country also certain tax deductions and credits will have a fixed impact on 2010 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced additionally significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of these tax deductions and credits on 2010 financial income tax rates 

 

given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect that our total financial income tax rate in 2010 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 20 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 20 these ranges do not include the impact of current and deferred income taxes that will be recognized upon the completion of the 2010 asset divestitures 

 

discontinued operations 

 

the following table shows the estimates for 2010 production pricing expenses and capital associated with our discontinued international operations for 2010 these estimates assume the sales will occur at the end of 2010 pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations the international assets will not be subject to dda during 2010 

 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

capital expenditures 

 

though we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not forecast nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions 

 

our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for our future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2010 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

 

given the limitations discussed above the following table shows expected ranges for drilling development and facilities expenditures by geographic area development capital includes development activity related to reserves classified as proved and drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

 

 

 

in addition to the above expenditures for drilling development and facilities we expect to capitalize between 330 million and 350 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 45 million and 55 million of interest we also expect to pay between 80 million and 90 million for plugging and abandonment charges additionally we expect to spend between 380 million and 430 million on our marketing and midstream assets which primarily include our oil pipelines gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems we expect to spend between 385 million and 435 million for corporate and other fixed assets 

 

other cash uses 

 

our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 016 per share quarterly dividend rate and 447 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2009 dividends are expected to approximate 286 million 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

our estimated 2010 cash uses including our capital activities are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our existing cash balances and operating cash flow another major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the divestiture of our offshore operations which we estimate will range from 45 billion to 75 billion after taxes the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2010 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited the amount of divestiture proceeds we ultimately receive is also uncertain however we expect our combined capital resources will be adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2010 additionally we can borrow commercial paper or access our lines of credit which had an available capacity of approximately 20 billion as of february 15 2010 to fund planned or additional capital activities

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

 

commodity price risk 

 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” consequently we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through various financial transactions that hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps basis swaps and costless price collars 

 

based on gas price contracts in place as of december 31 2009 we have approximately 13 bcf per day of gas production in 2010 that is associated with price swaps or fixedprice contracts this amount represents approximately 50 of our estimated 2010 gas production as of december 31 2009 we also have basis swaps associated with 02 bcf per day of our 2010 gas production all of the gas price swap contracts expire december 31 2010 the key terms of our gas price contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

based on oil price collar contracts in place as of december 31 2009 we have hedged 79000 barrels of oil per day for 2010 this amount represents approximately 65 of our estimated 2010 oil production the key terms of our oil collar contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

the fair values of our gas price and basis swaps and oil collars are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of relevant oil and gas price indexes at december 31 2009 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased the fair value of our gas price swaps by approximately 264 million a 10 increase in the forward curves associated with our oil collars would have decreased the fair value of these instruments by approximately 108 million 

interest rate risk 

 

at december 31 2009 we had debt outstanding of 73 billion of this amount 59 billion or 80 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 72 additionally we had 14 billion of outstanding commercial paper bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 029 

 

as of december 31 2009 our interest rate swaps consisted of instruments with a total notional amount of 185 billion these consist of instruments with a notional amount of 115 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate the remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps under the terms of the forward starting swaps we will net settle these contracts in september 2011 or sooner should we elect the net settlement amount will be based upon us paying a weightedaverage fixed rate of 399 and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the threemonth libor the difference between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the notional amount for the 30year period from september 30 2011 to september 30 2041 the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables 

 

 

 

 

 

the fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the federal funds rate and libor at december 31 2009 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have increased our net assets by approximately 46 million 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2009 balance sheet

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas we own oil and gas properties principally in the united states and canada and to a lesser degree various regions located outside north america including azerbaijan brazil and china in addition to our oil and gas operations we have marketing and midstream operations primarily in north america these include marketing gas crude oil and ngls and constructing and operating pipelines storage and treating facilities and natural gas processing plants a detailed description of our significant properties and associated 2008 developments can be found under “item 2 properties” 

 

we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 our common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in october 2004 we transferred our common stock listing to the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

 

strategy 

 

we have a twopronged operating strategy first we invest a significant portion of our capital budget in lowrisk development projects on our extensive north american property base which provides reliable and repeatable production and reserves additions to supplement that lowrisk part of our strategy we also annually invest capital in long cycletime projects to replenish our development inventory for the future the philosophy that underlies the execution of this strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by 

 

  

development of business 

 

during 1988 we expanded our capital base with our first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years this expansion is attributable to both a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling program we have increased our total proved reserves from 8 mmboe 1 at yearend 1987 to 2428 mmboe at yearend 2008 

 

during the same time period we have grown proved reserves from 066 boe 1 per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 544 boe per diluted share at the end of 2008 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 11 we have also increased production from 009 boe 1 per diluted share in 1987 to 053 boe per diluted share in 2008 for a compound annual growth rate of 9 this per share growth is a direct result of successful execution of our strategic plan and other key transactions and events 

 

we achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our operations during 2008 including those discussed below 

 

  

 

1 excludes the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for as poolings of interests 

  

  

we also completed construction and commenced operation of our northridge natural gas processing plant in southeastern oklahoma this plant can process up to 200 mmcf of natural gas per day and will support our growing production in the woodford shale 

 

we have also leveraged our knowledge of and expertise in the barnett shale into other unconventional natural gas plays such as the haynesville shale in eastern texas and western louisiana the cana shale play in western oklahoma and the cody play in montana we added approximately 800000 net undeveloped acres to our lease inventory positioning us with more than 14 million net acres in emerging unconventional natural gas plays 

 

in addition to production growth our us onshore properties also demonstrated measurable growth in proved reserves us onshore proved reserves grew 416 mmboe due to extensions discoveries and performance revisions this was almost three times our us onshore production in 2008 of 146 mmboe our drilling activities increased our 2008 us onshore proved reserves by 27 compared to the end of 2007 

 

  

pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations the amounts in this document related to continuing operations for 2008 and all prior years presented do not include amounts related to our operations in egypt and west africa

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

 

notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

oil natural gas and ngl marketing 

 

the spot markets for oil gas and ngls are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more or shortterm less than one year agreements regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or market sensitive prices 

 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements fixedprice contracts or firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

oil marketing 

 

our oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties as of february 2009 all of our oil production was sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

 

natural gas marketing 

 

our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2009 approximately 75 of our gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 24 of our production was committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices the remaining 1 of our gas production was sold under longterm fixedprice contracts 

ngl marketing 

 

our ngl production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary as of february 2009 approximately 97 of our ngl production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices the remaining ngl production is sold under longterm marketindexed contracts which are subject to market pricing variations 

 

marketing and midstream activities 

 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil gas and ngl production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area our midstream assets also include our 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and then transport the combined product to the edmonton area for sale 

 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

  

customers 

 

we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

 

the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

 

our ngl production is primarily sold to customers engaged in petrochemical refining and heavy oil blending activities pipelines railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products to market 

 

no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

seasonal nature of business 

 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

government regulation 

 

the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to this legislation numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size and financial strength 

 

the following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the united states canada and other international locations in which we operate 

 

exploration and production regulation 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations including but not limited to laws and regulations related to the acquisition of seismic data the location of wells drilling and casing of wells well production spill prevention plans emissions permitting the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes the plugging and abandoning of wells the transportation of production and in international operations minimum investments in the country of operations 

 

our operations are also subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in the united states some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

 

certain of our us oil and gas leases are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the bureau of land management and the minerals management service “mms” of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission also has jurisdiction over certain us offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

 

royalties and incentives in canada 

 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also 

established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

 

in december 2008 the provincial government of alberta enacted a new royalty regime the new regime provides for new royalties for conventional oil gas ngl and bitumen production effective january 1 2009 the royalties are linked to price and production levels and apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects 

 

this royalty regime reduced our proved reserves as of december 31 2008 by 28 mmboe additionally this regime is expected to reduce future earnings and cash flows from our oil and gas properties located in alberta the actual effect on our future earnings and cash flows of this royalty regime will be determined based on among other things our production rates from wells in alberta the proportion of our alberta production to our overall production our product mix in alberta commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 

 

pricing and marketing in canada 

 

any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract of a certain duration or covering a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export permit from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

 

investment canada act 

 

the investment canada act requires federal government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

 

production sharing contracts 

 

some of our international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years pscs also generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions as a result at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs generally allow the government agency to retain higher fractions of revenue 

 

environmental and occupational regulations 

 

we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste materials the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere the monitoring abandonment reclamation and remediation of well and other sites including sites of former operations and the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems is required to be implemented for some international oil and gas operations 

 

in 1997 numerous countries participated in an international conference under the united nations framework convention on climate change and adopted an agreement known as the kyoto protocol the “protocol” the protocol became effective february 16 2005 and requires reductions of certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases “ghg” certain countries in which we operate but 

not the united states have ratified the protocol pursuant to its ratification of the protocol in april 2007 the federal government of canada released its regulatory framework for air emissions a plan to implement mandatory reductions in ghg emissions by way of regulation under existing legislation the mandatory reductions on ghg emissions will create additional costs for the canadian oil and gas industry certain provinces in canada have also implemented legislation and regulations to reduce ghg emissions which will also have a cost associated with compliance presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions reductions in canada or elsewhere but such expenditures could be substantial 

 

in 2006 we published our corporate climate change position and strategy key components of the strategy include initiation of energy efficiency measures tracking emerging climate change legislation and publication of a corporate ghg emission inventory which occurred in january 2008 devon continues to explore energy efficiency measures and greenhouse gas emission reduction opportunities we also continue to monitor legislative and regulatory climate change developments all provisions of the strategy are completed or are in progress 

 

we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business with the efforts of our environmental health and safety department we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy we anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance while our unreimbursed expenditures in 2008 attributable to such matters were immaterial we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however we do not maintain 100 coverage concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a violation of law 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 5500 employees we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

 

oil gas and ngl prices are volatile 

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil gas and ngls a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating cash flows and profitability such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves the carrying value of our oil and gas properties the level of planned drilling activities and future growth historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability additional discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — proved reserves and estimated future net revenue” 

 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

 

the production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl 

production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons we are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries we have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur capital expenditures even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures 

 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls typically during times of high or rising commodity prices drilling and operating costs will also increase higher prices will also generally increase the costs of properties available for acquisition certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours and they have also established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production such as changing worldwide price and production levels the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

 

our operations outside north america are based primarily in azerbaijan brazil and china we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties in these areas that are more prevalent than what exist for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

 

government laws and regulations can change 

 

our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in the united states canada and the other countries in which we operate in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces tribal and local governments pursuant to such legislation numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such legislation have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability while such 

legislation can change at any time in the future those laws and regulations outside north america to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change 

 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

 

as an owner lessee or operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial tribal local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

 

insurance does not cover all risks 

 

exploration development production and processing of oil gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us due to changes in the insurance marketplace following hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in recent years we currently do not have coverage for any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the gulf of mexico 

 

certain of our investments are subject to risks that may affect their liquidity and value 

 

to maximize earnings on available cash balances we periodically invest in securities that we consider to be shortterm in nature and generally available for shortterm liquidity needs during 2007 we purchased assetbacked securities that have an auction rate reset feature “auction rate securities” our auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of more than 20 years however the underlying interest rates on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to 28 days therefore when we bought these securities they were generally priced and subsequently traded as shortterm investments because of the interest rate reset feature at december 31 2008 our auction rate securities totaled 122 million 

 

since february 8 2008 we have experienced difficulty selling our securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provided liquidity to these securities an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature due to continued auction failures throughout 2008 we consider these investments to be longterm in nature and generally not available for shortterm liquidity needs 

 

our auction rate securities are rated aaa — the highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and are collateralized by student loans that are substantially guaranteed by the united states government these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by continued problems in the global credit markets including but not limited to us subprime mortgage defaults writedowns by major financial institutions due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios including leveraged loans collateralized debt obligations credit default swaps and other creditlinked products these and other related factors have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues if issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate our ability to liquidate these securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited under such circumstances we may record an impairment charge on these investments in the future

substantially all of our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in our core operating areas these interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

 

we also have certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the barnett shale region in north texas these assets include approximately 3100 miles of pipeline two natural gas processing plants with 750 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator to support our continued development and growing production in the woodford shale located in southeastern oklahoma we constructed the northridge natural gas processing plant in 2008 the northridge plant has a capacity of 200 mmcf per day 

 

our midstream assets also include the access pipeline transportation system in canada this 220mile dual pipeline system extends from our jackfish operations in northern alberta to a 350 mbbls storage terminal in edmonton the dual pipeline system allows us to blend the jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the edmonton crude oil market for sale we have a 50 ownership interest in the access pipeline 

 

proved reserves and estimated future net revenue 

 

the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions existing economic and operating conditions is defined as those prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on escalations based upon future conditions 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” and require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators “qres” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards a list of our qres is kept by the senior advisor — corporate reserves all qres are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

 

the group is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserve estimates and includes the director — reserves and economics and the senior advisor — corporate reserves the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the senior vice president — strategic development is directly responsible for overseeing the group and reports to our president no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below 

 

in addition to internal audits we engage three independent petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of our proved reserves ryder scott company lp prepared the 2008 reserve estimates for all of our offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 99 of our international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2008 reserve estimates for 90 of our domestic onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants audited 78 of our canadian reserves 

set forth below is a summary of the reserves that were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

“prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee which consists of three independent members of our board of directors although we are not required to have a reserves committee we established ours in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee was designed to assist the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

 

the reserves committee meets at least twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following

the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and related estimated cash flow information as of december 31 2008 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included herein

 19 

 

as presented in the previous table we had 1934 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2008 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2008 

 

 

 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2008 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

 

the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2008 there can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

 

production revenue and price history 

 

certain information concerning oil gas and ngl production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other thirdparty interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2008 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

drilling activities

operation of properties 

 

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

 

we are the operator of 22527 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

 

organization structure and property profiles 

 

our properties are located within the us onshore and offshore regions canada and certain locations outside north america the following table presents proved reserve information for our significant properties as of december 31 2008 along with their production volumes for the year 2008 additional summary profile information for our significant properties is provided following the table 

 

we have certain north american onshore and offshore properties we consider to be significant because they may be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production however these 

properties are not included in the following table because as of december 31 2008 such properties had only minimal if any proved reserves or production onshore these properties include the haynesville cana and cody properties in the us and the horn river basin properties in canada offshore these properties include our deepwater development and exploration properties in the gulf of mexico these properties and our related development plans are discussed along with our other significant properties following the table 

 

also as presented in the table we had no proved reserves associated with our jackfish operations as of december 31 2008 during 2008 and thus far in 2009 we have been producing heavy oil from our jackfish property however due to low crude oil prices and unfavorable operating conditions as of december 31 2008 our jackfish reserves did not meet the existing economic and operating condition requirement to be classified as proved at the end of 2008

us onshore 

 

barnett shale  — the barnett shale located in north texas is our largest property both in terms of production and proved reserves our leases include approximately 715000 net acres located primarily in denton johnson parker tarrant and wise counties the barnett shale is a nonconventional reservoir and it produces natural gas and ngls we have an average working interest of greater than 90 we drilled 659 gross wells in 2008 

 

carthage  — the carthage area in east texas includes primarily harrison marion panola and shelby counties our average working interest is about 85 and we hold approximately 173000 net acres our carthage area wells produce primarily natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs we drilled 132 gross wells in 2008 

 

permian basin texas  — our oil and gas properties in the permian basin of west texas comprise approximately 470000 net acres located primarily in andrews crane ector martin terry ward and yoakum counties these properties produce both oil and gas from conventional reservoirs our average working interest in these properties is about 40 we drilled 71 gross wells in 2008 

 

washakie  — our washakie area leases are concentrated in carbon and sweetwater counties in southern wyoming our average working interest is about 76 and we hold about 157000 net acres in the area the washakie wells produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs in 2008 we drilled 115 gross wells 

 

groesbeck  — the groesbeck area of east texas includes portions of freestone leon limestone and robertson counties our average working interest is approximately 72 and we hold about 168000 net acres of land the groesbeck wells produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs in 2008 we drilled 16 gross wells 

 

woodford shale  — our woodford shale properties in southeastern oklahoma produce natural gas and ngls from a nonconventional reservoir our 54000 net acres are concentrated in coal and hughes counties and have an average working interest of about 57 in 2008 we drilled 131 gross wells in this area to support our production in the woodford shale we also brought online a 200 mmcf per day natural gas processing plant in 2008 

 

2009 development plans  — we expect 2009 oil gas and ngl prices will be noticeably lower than those for 2008 as a result we expect our operating cash flow will also be lower than that for 2008 and will require us to scale back our anticipated capital expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008 accordingly we expect to drill fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008 for the key us onshore areas discussed above 

 

our reduction in 2009 drilling activities in these areas is also related to our plan to devote a portion of our planned 2009 capital expenditures to develop three new unconventional natural gas plays in 2008 we built a position of nearly 13 million net acres in these unconventional natural gas plays in east texas and north louisiana we have accumulated approximately 570000 net acres prospective for the haynesville shale formation in western oklahoma our cana leasehold position targets the deep woodford shale formation in the anadarko basin we hold about 112000 net acres in the cana area in south central montana we have accumulated a significant leasehold position for our cody project area we hold approximately 575000 net acres in this region in 2009 we will continue to evaluate our acreage and drill wells in these emerging plays to assess the reserve and production potential of our acreage position 

us offshore 

 

deepwater producing  — our assets in the gulf of mexico include three significant producing properties — magnolia merganser and nansen — located in deep water greater than 600 feet we have a 50 working interest in merganser and nansen and a 25 working interest in magnolia the three fields are located on federal leases and total approximately 23000 net acres the properties produce both oil and gas 

 

deepwater development  — in addition to our three significant deepwater producing properties we will continue development activities on our deepwater cascade project throughout 2009 cascade was discovered in 2002 and is located on federal leases encompassing approximately 12000 net acres we have a 50 working interest in cascade production from cascade which will be primarily oil is expected to begin in 2010 cascade will be the first project in the gulf to utilize an fpso 

 

deepwater exploration  — our exploration program in the gulf of mexico is focused primarily on deepwater opportunities our deepwater exploratory prospects include mioceneaged objectives five million to 24 million years and older and deeper lower tertiary objectives we hold federal leases comprising approximately one million net acres in our deepwater exploration inventory 

 

in 2006 a successful production test of the jack no 2 well provided evidence that our lower tertiary properties may be a source of meaningful future reserve and production growth through 2008 we have drilled four discovery wells in the lower tertiary these include cascade in 2002 see “deepwater development” above st malo in 2003 jack in 2004 and kaskida in 2006 we currently hold 161 blocks in the lower tertiary and we have identified 21 additional prospects to date 

 

at st malo in which our working interest is 25 we drilled two delineation wells in 2008 at jack where our working interest is 25 we drilled a second appraisal well in 2008 a sidetrack appraisal well was drilled on the kaskida unit in 2008 and we commenced an additional delineation well in late 2008 our working interest in kaskida is 30 and we believe kaskida is the largest of our four lower tertiary discoveries to date 

 

also in 2008 we participated in a sidetrack delineation well on the mioceneaged mission deep discovery in which we have a 50 working interest we have identified 14 additional prospects in our deepwater miocene inventory to date 

 

in total we drilled seven exploratory and appraisal wells in the deepwater gulf of mexico in 2008 our working interests in these exploratory opportunities range from 25 to 50 in 2009 we will continue to perform additional delineation drilling and continue to plan the development of jack and st malo 

 

canada 

 

lloydminster  — our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta and western saskatchewan lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without steam injection we hold 25 million net acres and have an 89 average working interest in our lloydminster properties in 2008 we drilled 425 gross wells in the area 

 

peace river arch  — the peace river arch is located in west central alberta we hold approximately 569000 net acres in the area which produces primarily natural gas and ngls from conventional reservoirs our average working interest in the area is approximately 70 we drilled 66 gross wells in the peace river arch in 2008 

 

deep basin  — our properties in canada’s deep basin include portions of west central alberta and east central british columbia we hold approximately 602000 net acres in the deep basin the area produces primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs our average working interest in the deep basin is 45 in 2008 we drilled 61 gross wells 

 

northeast british columbia  — our northeast british columbia properties are located primarily in british columbia and to a lesser extent in northwestern alberta we hold approximately 17 million net acres in the 

area these properties produce principally natural gas from conventional reservoirs we hold a 76 average working interest in these properties we drilled 37 gross wells in the area in 2008 

 

jackfish  — by the end of 2008 we ramped up production from our 100owned jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta to 22000 bbls per day we are employing steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish production is expected to increase in 2009 to its peak production target of 35000 bbls per day we hold approximately 75000 net acres in the entire jackfish area which can support expansion of the original project in 2008 we received regulatory approval to develop a second phase of jackfish like the first phase this second phase of jackfish is also expected to eventually produce 35000 bbls per day of heavy oil production 

 

2009 development plans  — similar to our 2009 plans for our us onshore areas discussed above we expect to drill fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008 for the key areas in canada discussed above our plans to drill fewer wells in these areas is also affected by our intentions to devote a portion of our planned 2009 capital expenditures to develop our positions in the horn river basin in northeast british columbia in 2008 we accumulated approximately 153000 net acres targeting the devonian shale in this area in 2009 we will continue to evaluate our acreage and drill wells in this area to assess the reserve and production potential of our acreage position 

 

international 

 

azerbaijan  — outside north america devon’s largest international property in terms of proved reserves is the azerichiraggunashli “acg” oil field located offshore azerbaijan in the caspian sea acg produces crude oil from conventional reservoirs we hold approximately 6000 net acres in the acg field and have a 56 working interest in 2008 we participated in drilling 15 gross wells 

 

china  — our production in china is from the panyu development in the pearl river mouth basin in the south china sea the panyu fields produce oil from conventional reservoirs in addition to panyu which is located on block 1534 we hold leases in four exploratory blocks offshore china in total we have 79 million net acres under lease in china we have a 245 working interest at panyu and 100 working interests in the exploratory blocks we drilled seven gross wells in china in 2008 

 

brazil  — in 2008 we continued to ramp up production from our polvo development which we operate with a 60 working interest polvo is located offshore in the campos basin in block bmc8 we experienced mechanical issues during 2008 at polvo that delayed bringing a portion of our expected production online as of december 31 2008 the mechanical issues appear to have been corrected and we exited the year with gross production at approximately 17000 bbls per day in addition to our development project at polvo we hold acreage in eight exploratory blocks in aggregate we have 14 million net acres in brazil our working interests range from 18 to 100 in these blocks we drilled 12 gross wells in brazil in 2008 and over the next two years we plan to drill up to eight exploratory wells 

 

title to properties 

 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

royalty matters 

 

numerous natural gas producers and related parties including devon have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act the suits allege that the producers and related parties used belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and ngls produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel wright v chevron usa inc et al the “wright case” the suit was originally filed in august 1996 in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas but was consolidated in october 2000 with other suits for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming on july 10 2003 the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings on april 12 2007 the court entered a trial plan and scheduling order in which the case will proceed in phases two phases have been scheduled to date the first phase was scheduled to begin in august 2008 but the defendant settled prior to trial the second phase was scheduled to begin in february 2009 but the defendants settled prior to trial devon was not included in the groups of defendants selected for these first two phases devon believes that it has acted reasonably has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit and has paid royalties in good faith devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with respect to this lawsuit and therefore no liability related to this lawsuit has been recorded

overview of business 

 

devon is one of the world’s leading independent oil and gas exploration and production companies our operations are focused primarily in the united states and canada however we also explore for and produce oil and gas in select international areas including azerbaijan brazil and china we also own natural gas pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas making us one of north america’s larger processors of natural gas liquids 

 

our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable production and a platform for future growth over 90 percent of our production from continuing operations is from north america our production mix in 2008 was approximately 65 gas and 35 oil and ngls such as propane butane and ethane we are currently producing 26 bcf of gas each day or about 3 of all the gas consumed in north america 

 

in managing our global operations we have an operating strategy that is focused on creating and increasing value per share key elements of this strategy are building oil and gas reserves and production exercising capital discipline and controlling operating costs we also use our marketing and midstream operations to improve our overall performance finally we must continually preserve our financial flexibility to achieve sustainable longterm success 

 

  

approximately twothirds of our planned 2009 investment in capital projects is dedicated to a foundation of lowrisk projects primarily in north america the remainder of our capital has been identified for longerterm projects primarily in new unconventional natural gas plays in several united states onshore regions as well as continued offshore activities in the gulf of mexico brazil and china by deploying our capital in this manner we are able to consistently deliver costefficient drillbit growth and provide a strong source of cash flow while balancing shortterm and longterm growth targets

overview of 2008 results 

 

2008 was a year of contrasts by many measures 2008 was the best year in our history throughout the year we achieved key operational successes as we continued to execute on our operating strategy we drilled a record amount of wells with a 98 success rate and delivered a record amount of operating cash flow as a result of our operational success and rising commodity prices in the third quarter of 2008 we reported the largest quarterly earnings in our history 

 

however sharp declines in oil gas and ngl prices during the fourth quarter caused us to record noncash impairments of our oil and gas properties totaling 71 billion net of income taxes due to this impairment charge our record earnings in the third quarter were immediately followed by a record quarterly loss in the fourth quarter 

 

we account for our oil and gas properties using the full cost accounting method full cost impairment calculations require the use of quarterend prices as a result such calculations do not indicate the true fair value of the underlying reserves because of the volatile nature of commodity prices in fact the sec recently recognized that impairment calculations based upon prices as of a single day of the year are not ideal and issued new rules that require the use of 12month average prices for impairment calculations these new rules will be effective for our 2009 yearend reporting had these new rules been in place as of december 31 2008 we would not have recognized the noncash impairments 

 

key measures of our performance for 2008 as well as certain operational developments are summarized below 

 

 33 

 

despite these positive results we reported a net loss of 21 billion or 485 per diluted share for 2008 this represents a 58 billion decrease in earnings compared to 2007 which was primarily attributable to the 71 billion net of income tax property impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

from an operational perspective we completed another successful year with the drillbit we drilled a record 2441 gross wells with an overall 98 rate of success this success rate enabled us to increase proved reserves by 584 million boe which represented nearly 2 and one half times our 2008 production consistent with our twopronged operating strategy 93 of the wells we drilled were north american development wells 

 

besides completing another successful year of drilling we also had several other key operational achievements during 2008 in the gulf of mexico we continued to build off prior years’ successful drilling results with our deepwater exploration and development program at cascade we commenced drilling the first of two initial producing wells and continued work on production facilities and subsea equipment we also continued progressing toward commercial development of our other previous discoveries in the lower tertiary trend of the gulf of mexico we also added some 800000 net undeveloped acres to our lease inventory positioning us with more than 14 million net acres in four emerging unconventional natural gas plays in the united states 

 

in 2008 we substantially completed our african divestiture program we have now sold all our oil and gas producing properties in africa generating aggregate proceeds of 22 billion after income taxes 

 

additionally on october 31 2008 we transferred our 142 million shares of chevron common stock to chevron in exchange we received chevron’s interest in the drunkard’s wash coalbed natural gas field in eastcentral utah and 280 million in cash the field has approximately 51000 net acres and had net production of about 40 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day at the time of the exchange 

 

even with the fourth quarter net loss we strengthened our financial position during 2008 we used cash on hand operating cash flow divestiture proceeds and chevron exchange proceeds to fund 94 billion of capital expenditures reduce debt by 21 billion repurchase 815 million of common and preferred stock and pay 289 million of dividends at the end of 2008 we had 379 million of cash and as of january 31 2009 we had 31 billion of availability under our credit lines 

 

business and industry outlook 

 

as previously mentioned our current and future earnings depend largely on our ability to replace and grow oil and gas reserves increase production and exert cost discipline we must also manage commodity pricing risks to achieve longterm success 

 

oil and gas prices reached historical high levels in recent years and during the first half of 2008 we have utilized the record operating cash flows generated by high commodity prices along with proceeds from our african divestitures to among other uses repay outstanding debt during 2008 and 2007 we repaid outstanding debt totaling 39 billion during this same period we also repurchased 10 billion of our common stock and redeemed 150 million of preferred stock high commodity prices have also been a key factor driving cost increases in the oil and gas industry that have exceeded general inflation trends we are no different from others in the industry in that we have been impacted by these cost increases 

 

as we exited the third quarter of 2008 oil and gas prices had declined sharply from their recent record levels and declined even further through the end of 2008 in addition recent problems in the credit markets steep stock market declines financial institution failures and government bailouts provide evidence of a weakening united states and global economy as a result of the market turmoil and price decreases oil and gas companies with high debt levels and lack of liquidity have been and will continue to be negatively impacted however we do not consider ourselves to be in this category based on our current debt level and credit availability 

 

the only constant in the oil and gas business is volatility and 2008 presented us with some remarkable reminders our response to the current environment is to dramatically cut capital expenditures we are 

budgeting exploration and development capital at 35 billion to 41 billion for 2009 this is less than half of our 2008 investment in exploration and development with the addition of nonoil and gas capital and other capitalized costs we are forecasting total 2009 capital expenditures of 47 billion to 54 billion 

 

assuming average benchmark prices of 4500 per barrel of crude oil and 550 per mcf of gas our 2009 capital budget will require deficit spending of about 1 billion our philosophy has always been to live roughly within our cash flow and we clearly will not continue to spend at this rate in future years without some improvement in oil and gas prices however in order to preserve our business and maintain a level of momentum that will allow us to take advantage of stronger prices when markets recover we believe it is prudent to use our balance sheet strength to fund this additional 1 billion of spending in 2009 if we see further price weakness in 2009 or beyond we are prepared to make further cuts 

 

we are dramatically decreasing our activity across most of our nearterm development projects in north america we will continue activity at a rate that will keep us competitive but at a far lower level than in 2008 however we are going to continue the momentum of some of our longerterm growth projects that will position us to bring on new production when oil and gas demand recovers we are continuing to fund the second phase of our operations at jackfish and the evaluation and development of our lower tertiary assets in the gulf of mexico we will also move forward with the evaluation of our sizable acreage positions in several emerging natural gas plays in north america 

 

this decrease in development drilling will impact our oil and gas production we are currently forecasting our 2009 production will be essentially flat with that of 2008 

 

we are fortunate that we are positioned to withstand the downturn in the global economy and the resulting weakness in oil and gas prices the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our oil and gas properties position us to emerge from the current environment and prosper in the future 

 

results of operations 

 

revenues 

 

changes in oil gas and ngl production prices and revenues from 2006 to 2008 are shown in the following tables the amounts for all periods presented exclude results from our egyptian and west african operations which are presented as discontinued operations unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

nm — not meaningful 

 

the volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil gas and ngl sales between 2006 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

oil sales 

 

2008 vs 2007 oil sales increased 12 billion as a result of a 35 increase in our realized price without hedges the average nymex west texas intermediate index price increased 38 during the same time period accounting for the majority of the increase 

 

oil sales decreased 104 million due to a two million barrel decrease in production our international production decreased approximately six million barrels due to reaching certain cost recovery thresholds of our carried interest in azerbaijan we also deferred 05 million barrels of oil production due to hurricanes these 

decreases were partially offset by additional production resulting from increased development activity at our jackfish and lloydminster areas in canada and at our polvo development in brazil 

 

2007 vs 2006 oil sales increased 700 million due to a 13 million barrel increase in production the increase in our 2007 oil production was primarily due to our properties in azerbaijan where we achieved payout of certain carried interests in the last half of 2006 this led to a nine million barrel increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 production also increased 35 million barrels due to increased development activity in our lloydminster area in canada also oil sales from our polvo field in brazil began during the fourth quarter of 2007 which resulted in 05 million barrels of increased production 

 

oil sales increased 359 million as a result of an 11 increase in our realized price without hedges the average nymex west texas intermediate index price increased 9 during the same time period accounting for the majority of the increase 

 

 

gas sales 

 

2008 vs 2007 gas sales increased 17 billion as a result of a 29 increase in our realized price without hedges this increase was largely due to increases in the regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based 

 

a 77 bcf increase in production during 2008 caused gas sales to increase by 462 million our drilling and development program in the barnett shale field in north texas contributed 83 bcf to the gas production increase this increase and the effect of new drilling and development in our other north american properties were partially offset by natural production declines and the deferral of seven bcf of production in 2008 due to hurricanes 

 

2007 vs 2006 a 55 bcf increase in production caused gas sales to increase by 327 million our drilling and development program in the barnett shale field in north texas contributed 53 bcf to the gas production increase the june 2006 chief holdings llc “chief” acquisition also contributed 12 bcf of increased production during 2007 we also began first production from the merganser field in the deepwater gulf of mexico which resulted in seven bcf of increased production these increases and the effects of new drilling and development in our other north american properties were partially offset by natural production declines primarily in canada 

 

a 1 decline in our average realized price without hedges caused gas sales to decrease 52 million in 2007 

net loss gain on oil and gas derivative financial instruments 

 

the following tables provide financial information associated with our oil and gas hedges from 2006 to 2008 the first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues the subsequent tables present our oil gas and ngl prices with and without the effects of the cash settlements from 2006 to 2008 the prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our oil and gas derivative financial instruments include price swaps and costless price collars for the price swaps we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty the costless price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we cashsettle the difference with the counterparty cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized losses or gains related to our price swaps and collars 

during 2008 we received 27 million or 051 per bbl from counterparties to settle our oil price collars we paid 424 million or 045 per mcf to counterparties during 2008 to settle our gas price swaps and collars during 2007 we received 40 million or 004 per mcf from counterparties to settle our gas price swaps and collars in 2006 cash payments related to our gas price swaps and collars were completely offset by cash receipts 

 

in addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments in each reporting period we estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations from time to time we validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments based on the amount of volumes subject to price swaps and collars at december 31 2008 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased our 2008 unrealized gain for our oil and gas collar derivative financial instruments by approximately 54 million another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility 

 

counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with eight separate counterparties additionally our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment grade” the threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2008 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

the 243 million net unrealized gain recognized in 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in the inside ferc henry hub forward curve subsequent to our contract trade dates 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

the details of the changes in marketing and midstream revenues operating costs and expenses and the resulting operating profit between 2006 and 2008 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

2008 vs 2007 marketing and midstream revenues increased 556 million and operating costs and expenses increased 397 million causing operating profit to increase 159 million both revenues and expenses increased primarily due to higher natural gas and ngl prices and increased gas pipeline throughput 

 

2007 vs 2006 marketing and midstream revenues increased 64 million while operating costs and expenses decreased 9 million causing operating profit to increase 73 million revenues increased primarily due to higher prices realized on ngl sales 

oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses 

 

the details of the changes in oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses between 2006 and 2008 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

2008 vs 2007 loe increased 389 million in 2008 the largest contributor to this increase as well as the increase in loe per boe was higher perunit costs associated with new thermal heavy oil production from our jackfish operations in canada as well as new oil production from brazil as these largescale projects are in the early phases of production perunit operating costs are higher than the perunit costs for our overall portfolio of producing properties loe also increased 112 million due to our 6 growth in production additionally loe increased 31 million due to damages to certain of our facilities and transportation systems caused by hurricane ike in the third quarter of 2008 these hurricane damages also contributed to the increase in loe per boe 

 

2007 vs 2006 loe increased 403 million in 2007 the largest contributor to this increase was our 12 growth in production which caused an increase of 168 million another key contributor to the loe increase was the effects of inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services increased demand for these services continued to drive costs higher for materials equipment and personnel used in both recurring activities as well as wellworkover projects during 2007 furthermore changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar also caused loe to increase 40 million 

 

production taxes 

 

the following table details the changes in production taxes between 2006 and 2008 the majority of our production taxes are assessed on our onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the changes due to revenues in the table primarily relate to changes in oil gas and ngl revenues from our us onshore properties 

 

 

 

2008 vs 2007 production taxes increased 59 million due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2008 our higher production tax rates in 2008 were largely due to higher rates in china which are 

based on the level of crude oil prices as our realized price for crude oil sales in china increases or decreases production tax rates will increase or decrease in a like manner 

 

2007 vs 2006 production taxes decreased 66 million due to a decrease in the effective production tax rate in 2007 our lower production tax rates in 2007 were primarily due to an increase in tax credits received on certain horizontal wells in the state of texas and the increase in azerbaijan revenues subsequent to the payouts of our carried interests in the last half of 2006 our azerbaijan revenues are not subject to production taxes therefore the increased revenues generated in azerbaijan in 2007 caused our overall rate of production taxes to decrease 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties “dda” 

 

dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents our net capitalized investment plus future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

 

the changes in our production volumes dda rate per unit and dda of oil and gas properties between 2006 and 2008 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table details the increases in dda of oil and gas properties between 2006 and 2008 due to the changes in production volumes and dda rate presented in the table above 

 

 

 

2008 vs 2007 oil and gas property related dda increased 434 million due to a 15 increase in the dda rate the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2008 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors contributing to the rate increase include reductions in reserve estimates due to lower 2008 yearend commodity prices and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2008 drilling activities in addition to the impact from the higher 2008 rate our 6 production increase caused oil and gas property related dda expense to increase 164 million 

2007 vs 2006 oil and gas property related dda increased 355 million due to a 15 increase in the dda rate the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2007 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors contributing to the rate increase include the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2007 drilling activities and a higher canadiantous dollar exchange rate in 2007 the net effect of these increases was partially offset by higher reserve estimates due to higher 2007 yearend commodity prices in addition to the impact from the higher 2007 rate our 12 production increase caused oil and gas property related dda expense to increase 242 million 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially offset by two components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

 

 

 

 

  

2008 vs 2007 gross ga increased 241 million the largest contributors to the increase were higher employee compensation and benefits costs these cost increases which were largely related to our growth and industry inflation during most of 2008 caused gross ga to increase 184 million of this increase 79 million related to higher stock compensation 

 

stock compensation increased 27 million in the second quarter of 2008 due to a modification of the sharebased compensation arrangements for certain of our executives the modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who meet certain yearsofservice and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding sharebased grants as a condition to receiving the benefits of these modifications the executives must agree not to use or disclose devon’s confidential information and not to solicit devon’s employees and customers the executives are required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in each subsequent year until all grants have vested 

 

although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of the executives’ grants it does accelerate the expense recognition as executives approach the yearsofservice and age criteria when the modification was made in the second quarter of 2008 certain executives had already met the yearsofservice and age criteria as a result we recognized 27 million of sharebased compensation expense in the second quarter of 2008 related to this modification in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized an additional 16 million of stock compensation for grants made to these executives the additional expenses would have been recognized in future reporting periods if the modification had not been made and the executives continued their employment at devon 

the higher employee compensation and benefits costs exclusive of the accelerated stock compensation expense were also the primary factors that caused the 94 million increase in capitalized ga in 2008 

 

2007 vs 2006 gross ga increased 198 million the largest contributors to this increase were higher employee compensation and benefits costs these cost increases which were related to our growth and industry inflation during 2007 caused gross ga to increase 134 million of this increase 55 million related to higher stock compensation in addition changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate caused a 13 million increase in costs 

 

the factors discussed above were also the primary factors that caused the 69 million increase in capitalized ga in 2007 

 

interest expense 

 

the following schedule includes the components of interest expense between 2006 and 2008 

 

 

 

interest based on debt outstanding decreased 82 million from 2007 to 2008 this decrease was largely due to lower average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in 2008 than in 2007 the decrease in borrowings resulted largely from the use of proceeds from our west african divestiture program and cash flow from operations to repay all commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in the second quarter of 2008 additionally we retired debentures with a face value of 652 million during 2008 primarily during the third quarter 

 

interest based on debt outstanding increased 22 million from 2006 to 2007 this increase was largely due to higher average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in 2007 than in 2006 partially offset by the effects of repaying various maturing notes in 2007 and 2006 

 

capitalized interest increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher cumulative costs related to largescale development projects in the gulf of mexico and brazil partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from the completion of the access pipeline in canada 

 

capitalized interest increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to higher cumulative costs related to largescale development projects in the gulf of mexico and brazil higher cumulative costs related to the development of the second phase of our jackfish heavy oil development project in canada and the construction of the related access pipeline also contributed to the increase 

change in fair value of other financial instruments 

 

the details of the changes in fair value of other financial instruments between 2006 and 2008 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

chevron common stock and related embedded option 

 

prior to 2007 we recognized unrealized changes in the fair values of our investment in 142 million shares of chevron common stock as part of other comprehensive income effective january 1 2007 as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standard no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115  we began recognizing unrealized gains and losses on our investment in chevron common stock in net earnings rather than as part of other comprehensive income on october 31 2008 we exchanged these shares of chevron common stock for chevron’s interest in the drunkard’s wash properties located in eastcentral utah and 280 million in cash in accordance with the terms of the exchange the fair value of our investment in the chevron shares was estimated to be 6771 per share on the exchange date prior to the exchange of these shares we calculated the fair value of our investment in chevron common stock using chevron’s published market price 

 

we also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron common stock the embedded option was not actively traded in an established market therefore we estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for trades occurring near the valuation date since the exchangeable debentures were retired in august 2008 we will not recognize any future gains or losses from the embedded option 

 

the loss during 2008 on our investment in chevron common stock was directly attributable to a 2562 per share decrease in the estimated fair value while we owned chevron’s common stock during the year the gain on the embedded option during 2008 was directly attributable to the change in fair value of the chevron common stock from january 1 2008 to the maturity date of august 15 2008 the gain on our investment in chevron common stock and loss on the embedded option during 2007 were directly attributable to a 1980 increase in the price per share of chevron’s common stock during 2007 

 

interest rate swaps 

 

we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps each reporting period we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields from time to time we validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers 

 

the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by a third party based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate swaps at december 31 2008 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased our 2008 unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by approximately 3 million 

during 2008 we recorded a 104 million unrealized gain as a result of changes in interest rates subsequent to the trade dates of our contracts 

 

as previously discussed for our commodity derivative contracts counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative valuations we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our interest rate derivative contracts are held with five separate counterparties and have cash collateral posting requirements additionally the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of december 31 2008 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

during 2008 and 2006 we reduced the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

 

 

2008 reductions 

 

the 2008 reductions were all recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 and resulted primarily from a significant decrease in each country’s full cost ceiling the lower ceiling values largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil gas and ngl prices compared to previous quarterend prices to demonstrate this decline the december 31 2008 and september 30 2008 weighted average wellhead prices for the united states canada and brazil are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

 

na — not applicable 

 

the december 31 2008 oil and gas wellhead prices in the table above compare to the nymex cash price of 4460 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 571 per mmbtu for gas the september 30 2008 wellhead prices in the table compare to the nymex cash price of 10064 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 712 per mmbtu for gas 

 

2006 reductions 

 

as a result of a decline in the estimated future net revenues the carrying value of our russian oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling by 10 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006 therefore we 

recognized a 20 million reduction of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in russia offset by a 10 million deferred income tax benefit 

 

during the second quarter of 2006 we drilled two unsuccessful exploratory wells in brazil and determined that the capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired therefore in the second quarter of 2006 we recognized a 16 million impairment of our investment in brazil equal to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no tax benefit related to this impairment the two wells were unrelated to our polvo development project in brazil 

 

other income net 

 

the following schedule includes the components of other income between 2006 and 2008 

 

 

 

interest and dividend income decreased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in interest rates as well as a decrease in dividends received on our investment in chevron common stock interest and dividend income decreased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in incomeearning cash and investment balances partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate on our investment in chevron common stock 

 

we suffered insured damages in the third quarter of 2005 related to hurricanes that struck the gulf of mexico during 2006 and 2007 we received 480 million as a full settlement of the amount due from our primary insurers and certain of our secondary insurers during the fourth quarter of 2008 we received 106 million as full settlement of the amount due from our remaining secondary insurers our claims under our then existing insurance arrangements included both physical damages and business interruption claims as of december 31 2008 we had utilized 424 million of these proceeds as reimbursement of repair costs and deductible amounts resulting in excess recoveries the 162 million of excess recoveries was recorded as other income during 2008 

 

income taxes 

 

the following table presents our total income tax benefit expense related to continuing operations and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate for each of the past three years the primary factors causing our effective rates to vary from 2006 to 2008 and differ from the us statutory rate are discussed below 

 

 

 

for 2008 our effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate largely due to two related factors first during 2008 we repatriated 26 billion from certain foreign subsidiaries to the 

united states second we made certain tax policy election changes in the second quarter of 2008 to minimize the taxes we otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations as well as the taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in west africa as a result of the repatriation and tax policy election changes we recognized additional tax expense of 307 million during 2008 of the 307 million 290 million was recognized as current income tax expense and 17 million was recognized as deferred tax expense excluding the 307 million of additional tax expense our effective income tax benefit rate would have been 32 for 2008 

 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 deferred income taxes were reduced 7 million 261 million and 243 million respectively due to successive canadian statutory rate reductions that were enacted in each such year 

 

in 2006 deferred income taxes increased 39 million due to the effect of a new incomebased tax enacted by the state of texas that replaced a previous franchise tax the new tax was effective january 1 2007 

 

earnings from discontinued operations 

 

our discontinued operations consist of our operations in egypt and west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region 

 

in october 2007 we completed the sale of our egyptian operations and received proceeds of 341 million as a result of this sale we recognized a 90 million aftertax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007 

 

in the second quarter of 2008 we sold our assets and terminated our operations in certain west african countries consisting primarily of equatorial guinea and gabon as a result of the sales we recognized gains totaling 736 million 674 million after income taxes in 2008 from proceeds of 24 billion 17 billion net of income taxes and purchase price adjustments 

 

in the third quarter of 2008 we sold our assets and terminated our operations in cote d’ivoire as a result of this sale we recognized a gain of 83 million 95 million after income taxes in 2008 from proceeds of 205 million 163 million net of income taxes and purchase price adjustments 

 

with the cote d’ivoire transaction we completed the divestiture of all our oil and gas producing properties in africa the africa divestitures generated just over 30 billion of sales proceeds after income taxes and purchase price adjustments such proceeds totaled 22 billion and generated aftertax gains of 08 billion 

 

following are the components of earnings from discontinued operations between 2006 and 2008 

 

 

 

2008 vs 2007 earnings from discontinued operations increased 471 million in 2008 earnings in 2008 included 769 million of aftertax divestiture gains as discussed above this was 679 million more than the 90 million aftertax gain from the sale of our egyptian operations in 2007 the increase in 2008 was partially offset by a decrease of 212 million from reduced earnings due to the timing of the 2008 and 2007 divestitures 

 

2007 vs 2006 earnings from discontinued operations increased 248 million in 2007 in addition to variances caused by changes in production volumes and realized prices our earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 were impacted by other significant factors pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations we ceased recording dda in november 2006 related to our egyptian operations and in january 2007 related to our west african operations this reduction in dda caused earnings from discontinued operations to increase 119 million in 2007 earnings in 2007 also benefited from the 90 million gain from the sale of our egyptian operations 

in addition earnings from discontinued operations increased 90 million in 2007 due to the net effect of reductions in carrying value in 2006 and 2007 our earnings in 2007 were reduced by 13 million from these reductions compared to 103 million of reductions recorded in 2006 due to unsuccessful drilling activities in nigeria in the first quarter of 2006 we recognized an 85 million impairment of our investment in nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no income tax benefit related to this impairment as a result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in egypt during 2006 the net book value of our egyptian oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the ceiling by 18 million as of the end of september 30 2006 therefore in 2006 we recognized an 18 million aftertax loss 31 million pretax in the second quarter of 2007 based on drilling activities in nigeria we recognized a 13 million aftertax loss 64 million pretax 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

the following discussion of capital resources uses and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from 2006 to 2008 the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis therefore these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document additional discussion of these items follows the table 

 

 

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be our primary source of capital and liquidity in 2008 changes in operating cash flow are largely due to the same factors that affect our net earnings with the exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as dda financial instrument fair value changes property impairments and deferred income taxes as a result our operating cash flow increased 50 during 2008 primarily due to the 30 billion increase in oil gas and ngl revenues net of commodity hedge settlements as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 our capital expenditures were primarily funded by our operating cash flow in 2006 we used a combination of commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments to fund the 20 billion chief acquisition in june 2006 

 

other sources of cash 

 

as needed we utilize cash on hand and access our credit facilities and commercial paper program as sources of cash to supplement the liquidity provided by our operating cash flow additionally we sometimes acquire shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances as needed we may reduce such shortterm investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow 

 

during 2008 we reduced our shortterm investment balances by 250 million we also received 280 million from the exchange of our investment in chevron common stock 117 million from the sale of nonoil and gas property and equipment and 116 million from stock option exercises another significant source of cash was our african divestiture program in the second and third quarters of 2008 we received 26 billion in proceeds 19 billion net of income taxes and purchase price adjustments from sales of assets located in equatorial guinea and other west african countries also in conjunction with these asset sales we repatriated an additional 26 billion of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states 

 

we used these combined sources of cash in 2008 to fund debt repayments common stock repurchases redemptions of preferred stock and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

during 2007 we borrowed 15 billion under our unsecured revolving line of credit and reduced our shortterm investment balances by 202 million we also received 341 million of proceeds from the sale of our egyptian operations these sources of cash were used primarily to fund net commercial paper repayments longterm debt repayments common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

during 2006 we borrowed 18 billion under our commercial paper program and reduced our shortterm investment balances by 106 million these sources of cash were largely used to fund the 20 billion acquisition of chief in june 2006 also during 2006 we supplemented operating cash flow with cash on hand which was used to fund scheduled longterm debt maturities common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

capital expenditures 

 

following are the components of our capital expenditures for the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 87 billion 56 billion and 68 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 2008 capital expenditures include 26 billion related to acquisitions of properties in texas louisiana oklahoma and canada the 2006 capital expenditures include 20 billion related to the acquisition of the chief properties excluding the effect of these acquisitions the increase in capital expenditures from 2006 to 2008 was due to increased drilling activities in the barnett shale gulf of mexico carthage cana woodford shale groesbeck and washakie areas of the united states the lloydminster and jackfish projects in canada and in the polvo development in brazil expenditures also increased due to inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services 

 

our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines these midstream facilities exist primarily to support our oil and gas development operations the majority of our midstream expenditures from 2006 to 2008 were related to development activities in the barnett shale the woodford shale in southeastern oklahoma and jackfish in canada 

 

debt repayments 

 

during 2008 we repaid 15 billion in outstanding credit facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the sales of assets under our african divestiture program also during 2008 virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares of chevron common stock owned by us the debentures matured on august 15 2008 in lieu of delivering our shares of chevron common stock we exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders cash totaling 10 billion this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 652 million and a 379 million payment of the related embedded derivative option 

 

during 2007 we repaid the 400 million 4375 notes which matured on october 1 2007 also during 2007 certain holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares of chevron common stock prior to the debentures’ august 15 2008 maturity date in lieu of delivering shares of chevron common stock we exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders an amount of cash equal to the market value of chevron common stock we paid 167 million in cash to exchangeable debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 105 million and a 62 million payment of the related embedded derivative option 

 

during 2006 we retired the 500 million 275 notes and the 178 million 200 million canadian 655 senior notes we also repaid 180 million of debt acquired in the chief acquisition 

 

repurchases of common stock 

 

during the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 148 million shares at a total cost of 12 billion or 8398 per share under various repurchase programs during 2008 we repurchased 65 million shares at a cost of 665 million or 10256 per share during 2007 we repurchased 41 million shares at a cost of 326 million or 7980 per share during 2006 we repurchased 42 million shares at a cost of 253 million or 5961 per share 

 

redemption of preferred stock 

 

on june 20 2008 we redeemed all 15 million outstanding shares of our 649 series a cumulative preferred stock each share of preferred stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of 100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date 

dividends 

 

our common stock dividends were 284 million or a quarterly rate of 016 per share 249 million or a quarterly rate of 014 per share and 199 million or a quarterly rate of 01125 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively common dividends increased primarily due to the higher quarterly dividend rates 

 

we also paid 5 million of preferred stock dividends in 2008 and 10 million of preferred stock dividends in both 2007 and 2006 the decrease in the preferred dividends in 2008 was due to the redemption of our preferred stock in the second quarter of 2008 

 

liquidity 

 

historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow during 2008 we repatriated earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states in conjunction with the divestitures of our assets in west africa subsequent to these repatriations we do not expect to repatriate similar earnings from our historical operations in the foreseeable future additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and longterm debt we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

 

operating cash flow 

 

our operating cash flow has increased approximately 73 since 2006 reaching a total of 93 billion in 2008 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil gas and ngls we produce 

 

commodity prices  — prices for oil gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors which are difficult to predict create volatility in oil gas and ngl prices and are beyond our control although we expect this volatility to continue throughout 2009 we expect 2009 oil gas and ngl prices will be noticeably lower than those for 2008 the corresponding reduction in our operating cash flow will require us to scale back certain uses of cash during 2009 compared to 2008 including most notably our capital expenditures 

 

to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices we have utilized various price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of our production we have also utilized various price swap contracts and fixedprice physical delivery contracts to fix the price of a portion of our future oil and gas production based on contracts in place as of february 16 2009 in 2009 approximately 10 of our estimated gas production is subject to either price collars or fixedprice contracts the key terms of these contracts are summarized in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases as experienced in recent years can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow however the inverse is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices such as what we are currently experiencing 

 

interest rates — our operating cash flow can also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as of january 31 2009 we had longterm debt of 62 billion this included 60 billion of fixedrate debt and 02 billion of variablerate commercial paper borrowings the fixedrate debt bears interest at an overall weighted average rate of 723 we also have interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our fixedrate debt under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount of 105 billion including the effects of these swaps the weightedaverage interest rate related to our fixedrate debt was 664 as of january 31 2009 the key terms of these interest rate swaps are included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk” 

credit losses — our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways we are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil gas and ngl production we are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our jointinterest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate we are also exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as discussed previously in this report 

 

the recent deterioration of the global financial and capital markets combined with the drop in commodity prices has increased our credit risk exposure however we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers partners and counterparties such mechanisms include under certain conditions prepayment requirements for commodity sales and collateral posting requirements in our existing derivative contracts 

 

credit availability 

 

we have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program that we intend to access during 2009 to provide liquidity although we are reducing our planned 2009 capital expenditures we anticipate our operating cash flow in 2009 will be approximately 10 billion less than our capital expenditures due to significantly lower commodity prices 

 

we have a 265 billion syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the maturity date for 215 billion of the senior credit facility is april 7 2013 the maturity date for the remaining 05 billion is april 7 2012 all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders the senior credit facility includes a revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million 

 

amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of january 31 2009 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility 

 

on november 5 2008 we established a new 700 million 364day syndicated unsecured revolving senior credit facility the “shortterm facility” the shortterm facility provides us with incremental liquidity for nearterm capital expenditures 

 

the shortterm facility matures on november 3 2009 on the maturity date all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time amounts borrowed under the shortterm facility bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months such rates are generally based on libor or the prime rate as of january 31 2009 there were no borrowings under the shortterm facility 

 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 285 billion also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility or the shortterm facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of january 31 2009 we had 02 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 333 

 

the senior credit facility and shortterm facility contain only one material financial covenant this covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2008 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 186 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility and shortterm facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facilities include covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

 

the following schedule summarizes the capacity of our credit facilities by maturity date as well as our available capacity as of january 31 2009 

 

 

 

debt ratings 

 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by both fitch and standard  poor’s and baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s 

 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs from libor plus 35 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 45 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2008 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in february 2009 we provided guidance for our 2009 capital expenditures which are expected to range from 47 billion to 54 billion this estimate is significantly lower than our 2008 capital expenditures which coincides with the significant decline in current oil gas and ngl prices as well as the nearterm price expectations to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2009 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods 

beyond 2009 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current price expectations for 2009 and the commodity price collars and fixedprice contracts we have in place we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2009 capital expenditures 

 

common stock repurchase programs 

 

we have an ongoing annual stock repurchase program to minimize dilution resulting from restricted stock issued to and options exercised by employees in 2009 the repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 48 million shares or a cost of 360 million whichever amount is reached first 

 

in anticipation of the completion of our west african divestitures our board of directors approved a separate program to repurchase up to 50 million shares this program expires on december 31 2009 

 

in response to the current economic environment and recent downturn in commodity prices we have indefinitely suspended activity under both these programs as a result we do not anticipate repurchasing shares under these programs in the foreseeable future should economic conditions or commodity prices strengthen we will consider resumption of share repurchases under our authorized programs 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 is provided in the following table

pension funding and estimates 

 

funded status as compared to the projected benefit obligation our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 501 million and 230 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2008 changes to our underfunded status is included in note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 501 million underfunded status at the end of 2008 211 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans that have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2008 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 50 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

as compared to the accumulated benefit obligation our qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 209 million at december 31 2008 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels 

 

our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’ assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits earned by the participants as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the pension protection act “ppa” during 2008 investment losses significantly reduced the value of our plans’ assets this decrease was the primary contributor to the significant decrease in the funded status of our pension plans during 2008 the 2008 investment losses combined with our target funding levels will cause our 2009 contributions to be higher than those made in recent years we estimate we will contribute up to approximately 173 million to our qualified pension plans during 2009 however actual contributions may be less than this amount 

 

pension estimate assumptions our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 61 million 41 million and 31 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 

respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 114 million in 2009 should our actual 2009 contributions vary significantly from our current estimate of 173 million our actual 2009 pension expense could vary from this estimate 

 

the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

 

we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 725 and 840 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets at december 31 2008 the target investment allocation for our plan assets is 30 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 40 debt securities the target investment allocation for our plan assets at december 31 2007 was 50 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 725 to 625 would increase the expected 2009 pension expense by 5 million 

 

we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 600 and 622 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled considering the expected timing of future cash flows related to the plans this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 600 to 575 would increase our pension liability at december 31 2008 by 31 million and increase estimated 2009 pension expense by 5 million 

 

at december 31 2008 we had net actuarial losses of 440 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to the large investment losses on plan assets in 2008 reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages we estimate that approximately 45 million and 41 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2009 and 2010 respectively the 45 million estimated to be recognized in 2009 is a component of the total estimated 2009 pension expense of 114 million referred to earlier in this section 

 

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

 

contingencies and legal matters 

 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

 

the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

full cost ceiling calculations 

 

policy description 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

 

if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 20 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the amount of our reserves that are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants 

 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged less than 2 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used and that 

prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs rather they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment this adjustment requires little judgment as the endofperiod price is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges none of our outstanding derivative contracts at december 31 2008 qualified for hedge accounting treatment 

 

because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and gas prices have historically been volatile on any particular day at the end of a quarter prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns however considering current and nearterm estimates of oil and gas prices such writedowns may be more likely to occur during 2009 than in recent periods 

 

the sec recently revised the requirement to use quarterend prices to calculate the full cost ceiling beginning on december 31 2009 the ceiling will be calculated using a 12month average price see “modernization of oil and gas reporting” for more information on the sec’s revised rules

we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production that hedge the future prices received these instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas price volatility our derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps and costless price collars under the terms of the swaps we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty the price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we will cashsettle the difference with the counterparty to the collars 

 

we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility we use these swaps to mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our fixedrate debt under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount 

 

all derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met if such criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity until the hedged transaction occurs the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations if such criteria are met for fair value hedges the change in the fair value is recorded in the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item cash settlements with counterparties to our derivative financial instruments also increase or decrease earnings at the time of the settlement 

 

a derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business combination or other transaction that includes derivative contracts additionally we must document the relationship between the 

hedging instrument and hedged item as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the instrument we must also assess both at the instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the hedged item for derivative financial instruments held during 2008 2007 and 2006 we chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify our derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment 

 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment we estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices we base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the inside ferc henry hub forward curve for gas instruments and the nymex west texas intermediate forward curve for oil instruments another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials 

 

we estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yields the most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields we base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the libor or the federal funds rate provided by third parties another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward yields which we base primarily upon implied volatility the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter these yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields 

 

from time to time we validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties andor brokers 

 

in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations this is primarily the result of two factors first we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties our commodity derivative contracts are held with eight separate counterparties and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with five separate counterparties second our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment grade” the threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade such thresholds generally range from zero to 50 million for the majority of our contracts as of december 31 2008 the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade 

 

quarterly changes in our derivative fair value estimates have only a minimal impact on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations as long as the derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can have a significant impact on our results of operations but generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 

 

settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

business combinations 

 

policy description 

 

from our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003 we grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting current accounting pronouncements require the purchase method to be used to account for any future acquisitions 

 

under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies endofperiod price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

 

generally in our business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that we assume in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

 

except for the 2002 acquisition of mitchell energy  development corp our mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and 

production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

 

the mitchell midstream assets primarily serve gas producing properties that we also acquired from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

 

in addition to the valuation methods described above we perform other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

 

in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination we compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently we compare these comparable transaction multiples to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

 

while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it is a noncash charge but it would adversely affect results of operations as discussed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital resources uses and liquidity” in calculating our debttocapitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

 

our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years our annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged less than 2 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there 

are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

 

valuation of goodwill 

 

policy description 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment at least annually the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value of the reporting unit if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value including goodwill then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the annual impairment test requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities because quoted market prices are not available for devon’s reporting units the fair values of the reporting units are estimated in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment 

 

generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

 

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r business combinations  which replaces statement no 141 statement no 141r retains the fundamental requirements of statement no 141 that an acquirer be identified and the acquisition method of accounting previously called the purchase method be used for all business combinations statement no 141r’s scope is broader than that of statement no 141 which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses statement no 141r improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports statement no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as well as any resulting goodwill statement no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we will evaluate how the new requirements of statement no 141r would impact any business combinations completed in 2009 or thereafter 

 

in december 2007 the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51  a noncontrolling interest sometimes called a minority interest is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent statement no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary under statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary must be reported as a component of 

consolidated equity separate from the parent’s equity additionally the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest must be reported separately on the face of the income statement statement no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited the adoption of statement no 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued staff position no fas 132r1 employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  staff position 132r1 amends fasb statement no 132 revised 2003 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  to require additional disclosures about the types of assets and associated risks in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan staff position 132r1 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 we are evaluating the impact the adoption of staff position 132r1 will have on our financial statement disclosures however our adoption of staff position 132r1 will not affect our current accounting for our pension and postretirement plans 

 

modernization of oil and gas reporting 

 

in december 2008 the sec adopted revisions to its required oil and gas reporting disclosures the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves in the three decades that have passed since adoption of these disclosure items there have been significant changes in the oil and gas industry the amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology in addition the amendments concurrently align the sec’s full cost accounting rules with the revised disclosures the revised disclosure requirements must be incorporated in registration statements filed on or after january 1 2010 and annual reports on form 10k for fiscal years ending on or after december 31 2009 a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 

 

the following amendments have the greatest likelihood of affecting our reserve disclosures including the comparability of our reserves disclosures with those of our peer companies 

 

  

the revised rules also amend the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to include reserves located beyond development spacing areas that are immediately adjacent to developed spacing areas if economic producibility can be established with reasonable certainty these revisions are designed to permit the use of alternative technologies to establish proved reserves in lieu of requiring companies to use specific tests in addition they establish a uniform standard of reasonable certainty that applies to all proved reserves regardless of location or distance from producing wells 

because the revised rules generally expand the definition of proved reserves we expect our proved reserve estimates will increase upon adoption of the revised rules however we are not able to estimate the magnitude of the potential increase at this time 

 

  

forwardlooking estimates 

 

we are providing our 2009 forwardlooking estimates in the following discussion these estimates are based on our examination of historical operating trends the information used to prepare our december 31 2008 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties the forwardlooking estimates in this discussion were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil gas and ngls during 2009 will be substantially similar to those that existed in 2008 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2009 exchange rate of 080 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

 

operating items 

 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

set forth below are our estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2009 we estimate that our combined 2009 oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 235 to 241 mmboe of this total approximately 97 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2008 the following estimates for oil gas and ngl production are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total production 

 

 

 

oil and gas prices 

 

we expect our 2009 average prices for the oil and gas production from each of our operating areas to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the expected ranges for gas prices are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the gas financial contracts presented in the “commodity price risk management” section below 

the nymex price for oil is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma the nymex price for gas is determined to be the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

 

 

 

 

nm — not meaningful 

 

commodity price risk management 

 

from time to time we enter into nymex related financial commodity collar and price swap contracts such contracts are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas price volatility although these financial contracts do not relate to specific production from our operating areas they will affect our overall revenues earnings and cash flow in 2009 

 

as of february 3 2009 our financial commodity contracts pertaining to 2009 consisted only of gas collars the key terms of these contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

to the extent that monthly nymex prices in 2009 are outside of the ranges established by the gas collars we and the counterparties to the contracts will settle the difference such settlements will either increase or decrease our revenues for the period also we will marktomarket the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2009 changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as increases or decreases to our revenues the expected ranges of our realized gas prices as a percentage of nymex prices which are presented earlier in this report do not include any estimates of the impact on our gas prices from monthly settlements or changes in the fair values of our gas collars 

 

in january 2009 we entered into an early settlement arrangement with one of our counterparties as a result of this early settlement we received 36 million in january 2009 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of gas and ngls provisions of contractual agreements and the amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes 

 

these factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that our 2009 marketing and midstream operating profit will be between 375 million and 425 million we estimate that marketing and midstream revenues will be 

between 1075 billion and 1425 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 0700 billion and 1000 billion 

 

production and operating expenses 

 

our production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties the amount of repair and workover activity required and changes in production tax rates oil gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

 

given these uncertainties we expect that our 2009 lease operating expenses will be between 193 billion and 227 billion additionally we estimate that our production taxes for 2009 will be between 325 and 375 of total oil gas and ngl revenues excluding the effect on revenues from financial collar contracts upon which production taxes are not assessed 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

our 2009 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2009 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts and revisions to our yearend 2008 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2009 our reserve estimates as of december 31 2008 included negative price revisions of 473 mmboe the following oil and gas property related dda estimates are largely based on the assumption that the yearend 2008 negative price revisions will not reverse during 2009 however if such negative price revisions reverse in whole or in part our actual oil and gas property related dda rate could vary materially from our estimate 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 1025 per boe and 1075 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2009 is expected to be between 244 billion and 256 billion 

 

additionally we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets will total between 315 million and 335 million in 2008 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligations 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligations in 2009 is expected to be between 85 million and 95 million 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

 

given these limitations we estimate our ga for 2009 will be between 565 million and 605 million this estimate includes approximately 110 million of noncash sharebased compensation net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict whether we will incur full cost writedowns in 2009 however such writedowns may be more likely to occur during 2009 than in recent 

periods considering current and nearterm estimates of oil and gas prices which are generally expected to be lower than prices in existence prior to the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

we recognized full cost ceiling writedowns related to our oil and gas properties in the united states canada and brazil in the fourth quarter of 2008 these writedowns resulted primarily from significant declines in oil and gas prices compared to previous quarterend prices the december 31 2008 weighted average wellhead prices for these countries are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

 

na — not applicable 

 

the wellhead prices in the table above compare to the december 31 2008 nymex cash price of 4460 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 571 per mmbtu for gas should 2009 quarterend prices approximate or decrease from these december 31 2008 prices the likelihood that we will incur full cost writedowns during 2009 will increase 

 

 

interest expense 

 

future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2009 from sales of oil gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow this increases the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense other factors which affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally within our control 

 

as of january 31 2009 we had total debt of 62 billion this included 60 billion of fixedrate debt and 02 billion of variablerate commercial paper borrowings the fixedrate debt bears interest at an overall weighted average rate of 723 the commercial paper borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of january 31 2009 the weighted average variable rate for our commercial paper borrowings was 333 additionally any future borrowings under our credit facilities would bear interest at various fixedrate options for periods up to twelve months and are generally less than the prime rate 

 

based on the factors above we expect our 2009 interest expense to be between 330 million and 340 million this estimate assumes no material changes in prevailing interest rates or to our existing interest rate swap contracts presented above this estimate also assumes that our total debt will increase approximately 10 billion during 2009 primarily in the form of commercial paper borrowings 

 

the 2009 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three primary components — interest related to outstanding debt fees and issuance costs and capitalized interest we expect the interest expense in 2009 related to our fixedrate and floatingrate debt including net accretion of related discounts to be between 435 million and 445 million we expect the interest expense in 2009 related to facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to outstanding debt balances to be between 5 million and 15 million we also expect to capitalize between 110 million and 120 million of interest during 2009 

interest rate risk management 

 

we also have interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our fixedrate debt under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount of 105 billion the key terms of these interest rate swaps are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

including the effects of these swaps the weightedaverage interest rate related to our fixedrate debt was 664 as of january 31 2009 

 

income taxes 

 

our financial income tax rate in 2009 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2009 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2009 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced 

 

given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect that our consolidated financial income tax rate in 2009 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 20 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 20 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2009 financial income tax rates 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

capital expenditures 

 

though we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not “budget” nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions 

 

our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for our future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2009 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

 

given the limitations discussed above the following table shows expected ranges for drilling development and facilities expenditures by geographic area development capital includes development activity related to reserves classified as proved and drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there 

is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

 

 

 

in addition to the above expenditures for drilling development and facilities we expect to spend between 325 million to 425 million on our marketing and midstream assets which primarily include our oil pipelines natural gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems additionally we expect to capitalize between 460 million and 480 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 110 million and 120 million of interest we also expect to pay between 105 million and 115 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 230 million and 250 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets we anticipate spending between 40 million and 50 million to fulfill drilling commitments related to our assets held for sale 

 

other cash uses 

 

our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 016 per share quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2008 dividends are expected to approximate 284 million 

 

we have various defined benefit pension plans the vast majority of these plans are subject to minimum funding requirements during 2008 investment losses significantly reduced the funded status of these plans accordingly our 2009 contributions to these plans are expected to be significantly higher than those made in recent years depending on the funding targets we may attempt to achieve we estimate we will contribute between 100 million and 175 million to our pension plans during 2009 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

our estimated 2009 cash uses including our drilling and development activities and retirement of maturing debt are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our existing cash balances and operating cash flow any remaining cash uses could be funded by increasing our borrowings under our commercial paper program or with borrowings from the available capacity under our credit facilities which was approximately 31 billion as of january 31 2009 the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2009 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however we expect our combined capital resources to be adequate to fund our capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2009 

 

if significant other acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year we could utilize our existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” 

 

we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through various financial transactions that hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we will settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 

 

based on gas contracts in place as of february 16 2009 we have approximately 03 bcf per day of gas production in 2009 that is associated with price collars or fixedprice contracts this amount represents approximately 10 of our estimated 2009 gas production or 7 of our total boe production all of the price collar contracts expire december 31 2009 our fixedprice physical delivery contracts extend through 2011 these physical delivery contracts relate to our canadian gas production and range from six bcf to 14 bcf per year these physical delivery contracts are not expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices from 2009 through 2011 

 

the key terms of our gas price collar contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

the fair values of our and gas price collars are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of relevant oil and gas price indexes at december 31 2008 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased the net assets recorded for our commodity hedging instruments by approximately 54 million 

 

interest rate risk 

 

at december 31 2008 we had debt outstanding of 58 billion of this amount 48 billion or 83 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 72 additionally we had 10 billion of outstanding commercial paper bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 30 

 

we also have interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our fixedrate debt under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount of 105 billion the key terms of these interest rate swaps are presented in the following table 

 

 

the fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the federal funds rate and libor at december 31 2008 a 10 increase in these forward curves would have decreased our net assets by approximately 3 million 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2008 balance sheet

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas we own oil and gas properties principally in the united states and canada and to a lesser degree various regions located outside north america including azerbaijan brazil and china we also own properties in west africa that we intend to sell in 2008 in addition to our oil and gas operations we have marketing and midstream operations primarily in north america these include marketing natural gas crude oil and ngls and constructing and operating pipelines storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of our significant properties and associated 2007 developments can be found under “item 2 properties” 

 

we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 our common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in october 2004 we transferred our common stock listing to the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

 

strategy 

 

we have a twopronged operating strategy first we invest the vast majority of our capital budget in lowrisk exploitation and development projects on our extensive north american property base which provides reliable and repeatable production and reserves additions to supplement that lowrisk part of our strategy we also annually invest a measured amount of capital in highimpact long cycletime projects to replenish our development inventory for the future the philosophy that underlies the execution of this strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by 

 

  

development of business 

 

during 1988 we expanded our capital base with our first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years this expansion is attributable to both a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling program we have increased our total proved reserves from 8 mmboe 1 at yearend 1987 to 2496 mmboe 2 at yearend 2007 

 

during the same time period we have grown proved reserves from 066 boe 1 per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 556 boe 2 per diluted share at the end of 2007 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 11 we have also increased production from 009 boe 1 per diluted share in 1987 to 050 boe 2 per diluted share in 2007 for a compound annual growth rate of 9 this per share growth is a direct result of successful execution of our strategic plan and other key transactions and events 

 

 

1 excludes the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for as poolings of interests 

2 excludes reserves in west africa that are held for sale and classified as discontinued operations as of december 31 2007 

we achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our operations during 2007 including those discussed below 

 

  

in addition to production growth our us onshore properties also demonstrated measurable growth in proved reserves us onshore proved reserves grew 282 mmboe due to extensions discoveries and performance revisions this was more than double our us onshore production in 2007 of 125 mmboe our drilling activities increased our 2007 us onshore proved reserves by14 compared to the end of 2006 

 

  

specific gulf of mexico developments in 2007 included the following 

 

  

 6 

  

  

in november 2006 and january 2007 we announced plans to divest our operations in egypt and west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in north america and in the deepwater gulf of mexico additionally we will sharpen our focus in north america and concentrate our international operations in brazil and china where we have established competitive advantages 

 

in october 2007 we completed the sale of our operations in egypt and received proceeds of 341 million as a result of this sale we recognized a 90 million aftertax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007 in november 2007 we announced an agreement to sell our operations in gabon for 2055 million we are finalizing purchase and sales agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government approvals for the remaining properties in the west african divestiture package we are optimistic we can complete these sales during the first half of 2008 

 

pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations the amounts in this document related to continuing operations for 2007 and all prior years presented do not include amounts related to our operations in egypt and west africa 

 

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

 

notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

oil natural gas and ngl marketing 

 

the spot market for oil gas and ngls is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate as detailed below we sell our production under both longterm one year or more or shortterm less than one year agreements regardless of the term of the contract the vast majority of our production is sold at variable or market sensitive prices 

 

additionally we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements fixedprice contracts or firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

oil marketing 

 

our oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties as of february 2008 all of our oil production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

 

natural gas marketing 

 

our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2008 approximately 81 of our natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 17 of our production was committed under various longterm 

contracts which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices the remaining 2 of our gas production was sold under longterm fixed price contracts 

 

ngl marketing 

 

our ngl production is sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary as of february 2008 approximately 69 of our ngl production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices the remaining ngl production is sold under longterm marketindexed contracts which are subject to market pricing variations 

 

marketing and midstream activities 

 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil gas and ngl production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area our midstream assets also include our 50 interest in the access pipeline transportation system in canada this pipeline system allows us to blend our jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and then transport the combined product to the edmonton area 

 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

  

customers 

 

we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

 

the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

 

our ngl production is primarily sold to customers engaged in petrochemical refining and heavy oil blending activities pipelines railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products to market 

 

no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2007 2006 or 2005 

 

seasonal nature of business 

 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas 

storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

 

government regulation 

 

the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to this legislation numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability because new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 

 

the following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the united states canada and other international locations in which we operate 

 

exploration and production regulation 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations including regulations related to the acquisition of seismic data the location of wells drilling and casing of wells well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes the plugging and abandoning of wells the transportation of production and in international operations minimum investments in the country of operations 

 

our operations are also subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and natural gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties in the united states some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

 

certain of our us oil and natural gas leases are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the bureau of land management and the minerals management service “mms” of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission also has jurisdiction over certain us offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

 

royalties and incentives in canada 

 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed 

reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

 

on october 25 2007 the provincial government of alberta announced a new royalty regime the new regime contemplates the introduction of new royalties for conventional oil natural gas ngl and bitumen production effective january 1 2009 the royalties will be linked to price and production levels and will apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects 

 

the implementation of the proposed changes to the royalty regime in alberta is subject to certain risks and uncertainties the significant changes to the royalty regime require new legislation changes to the existing legislation and regulation and development of proprietary software to support the calculation and collection of royalties additionally certain proposed changes contemplate further public andor industry consultation finally the proposed royalty structure may be modified prior to its implementation 

 

we believe this proposal would reduce future earnings and cash flows from our oil and gas properties located in alberta additionally assuming all other factors are equal higher royalty rates would likely result in lower levels of capital investment in alberta relative to our other areas of operations however the magnitude of the potential impact which will depend on the final form of enacted legislation and other factors that impact the relative expected economic returns of capital projects cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

 

pricing and marketing in canada 

 

any oil or natural gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract of a certain duration or covering a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export permit from canada’s national energy board “neb” the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere 

 

investment canada act 

 

the investment canada act requires government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

 

production sharing contracts 

 

many of our international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years pscs also generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions as a result at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs generally allow the government agency to retain higher fractions of revenue 

 

environmental and occupational regulations 

 

we are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste materials the monitoring abandonment reclamation and remediation of well and other sites including sites of former operations and the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans 

the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems is required to be implemented for some international oil and gas operations 

 

in 1997 numerous countries participated in an international conference under the united nations framework convention on climate change and adopted an agreement known as the kyoto protocol the “protocol” the protocol became effective february 16 2005 and requires reductions of certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases “ghg” certain countries in which we operate but not the united states have ratified the protocol pursuant to its ratification of the protocol in april 2007 the federal government of canada released its regulatory framework for air emissions a plan to implement mandatory reductions in ghg emissions by way of regulation under existing legislation the mandatory reductions on ghg emissions will create additional costs for the canadian oil and gas industry certain provinces in canada have also implemented legislation and regulations to reduce ghg emissions which will also have a cost associated with compliance presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions reductions in canada or elsewhere but such expenditures could be substantial 

 

in 2006 we published our corporate climate change position and strategy key components of the strategy include initiation of energy efficiency measures tracking emerging climate change legislation and publication of a corporate ghg emission inventory which occurred in january 2008 all provisions of the strategy are completed or are in progress 

 

we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business with the efforts of our environmental health and safety department we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental and safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy we anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment while our unreimbursed expenditures in 2007 concerning such matters were immaterial we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however we do not maintain 100 coverage concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a violation of law 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 5000 employees we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees 

 

competition

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

 

oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile 

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil natural gas and ngls a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves revenues and operating cash flows as well as the level of planned drilling activities such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future growth historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability additional discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — proved reserves and estimated future net revenue” 

 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

 

the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl 

production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons we are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries we have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur capital expenditures even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures 

 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls higher recent commodity prices have increased drilling and operating costs higher prices have also increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of publicly traded companies and privateequity firms with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours and they have also established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

 

our operations outside north america are based primarily in azerbaijan brazil and china we also have operations in various countries in west africa that we intend to sell in 2008 in these areas outside of north america we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties that are more prevalent than what exist for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

 

government laws and regulations can change 

 

our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in the united states canada and the other countries in which we operate in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces and local governments pursuant to such legislation numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such legislation have affected and at times in the future could affect our operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability while such legislation can change at 

any time in the future those laws and regulations outside north america to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change 

 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

 

insurance does not cover all risks 

 

exploration development production and processing of oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us due to changes in the insurance marketplace following the 2005 hurricanes in the gulf of mexico we currently have only a de minimis amount of coverage for any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the gulf of mexico 

 

our shortterm investments are subject to risks which may affect their liquidity and value 

 

to maximize earnings on available cash balances we periodically invest in securities that we consider to be shortterm in nature and generally available for shortterm liquidity needs such investments include assetbacked securities that have an auction rate reset feature “auction rate securities” our auction rate securities are collateralized by student loans which are substantially guaranteed by the united states government and generally have contractual maturities of more than 20 years however the underlying interest rates on such securities are scheduled to reset every 28 days therefore these auction rate securities are generally priced and subsequently trade as shortterm investments because of the interest rate reset feature 

 

at december 31 2007 we held 372 million of auction rate securities subsequent to december 31 2007 we have reduced our auction rate securities holdings to 153 million however beginning on february 8 2008 we experienced difficulty selling additional securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provides liquidity to these securities an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every 28 days until the auction succeeds the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature accordingly there may be no effective mechanism for selling these securities 

 

all of our auction rate securities including those subject to failed auctions are currently rated aaa — the highest rating — by one or more rating agencies however these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by continued problems in the global credit markets including but not limited to us subprime mortgage defaults writedowns by major financial institutions due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios including leveraged loans collateralized debt obligations credit default swaps and other creditlinked products these and other related factors have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues if issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate our ability to liquidate these securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited as a result we may deem such investments to be longterm in nature and generally not available for shortterm liquidity needs additionally under such circumstances we may record an impairment charge on these investments in the future

substantially all of our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in our core operating areas these interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

 

we also have certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the barnett shale region in north texas these assets include approximately 2700 miles of pipeline two gas processing plants with 750 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator to support our production in the woodford shale located in southeast oklahoma we plan to bring online a 200 mmcf per day gas processing plant in 2008 

 

our midstream assets also include the access pipeline transportation system in canada this 220mile dual pipeline system extends from our jackfish operations in northern alberta to a 350 mbbls storage terminal in edmonton the dual pipeline system allows us to blend the jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the combined product to the edmonton crude oil market we have a 50 ownership interest in the access pipeline 

 

proved reserves and estimated future net revenue 

 

the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on escalations based upon future conditions 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” our policies also require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators “qres” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards a list of our qres is kept by the senior advisor — corporate reserves all qres are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

 

the group is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates and includes the manager — reserves and economics and the senior advisor — corporate reserves the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the vice president — strategic planning is directly responsible for overseeing the group and reports to our president no portion of the group’s compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below 

 

in addition to internal audits we engage three independent petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of our proved reserves ryder scott company lp prepared the 2007 reserves estimates for all our offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 99 of our international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2007 reserves estimates for 88 of our domestic onshore 

properties ajm petroleum consultants prepared estimates covering 34 of our 2007 canadian reserves and audited an additional 51 of our canadian reserves 

 

set forth below is a summary of the reserves that were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

“prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

 

in addition to conducting these internal and external reviews we also have a reserves committee which consists of four independent members of our board of directors although we are not required to have a reserves committee we established ours in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process the reserves committee was designed to assist the board of directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves much like our audit committee assists the board of directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements besides being independent the members of our reserves committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process 

 

the reserves committee meets at least twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants the responsibilities of the reserves committee include the following

 19 

as presented in the previous table we had 1874 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2007 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2007 

 

 

 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2007 except in filings with the sec and the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

 

the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2007 there can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

 

production revenue and price history 

 

certain information concerning oil natural gas and ngl production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other third party interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2007 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

operation of properties 

 

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

 

we are the operator of 21226 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

organization structure and property profiles 

 

our properties are located within the us onshore and offshore regions canada and certain locations outside north america the following table presents proved reserve information for our significant properties as of december 31 2007 along with their production volumes for the year 2007 included in the table are certain us offshore properties that currently have no proved reserves or production such properties are considered significant because they may be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production the table does not include our west african operations that were classified as discontinued in 2007 additional summary profile information for our significant properties is provided following the table

in 2006 a successful production test of the jack no 2 well provided evidence that our lower tertiary properties may be a source of meaningful future reserve and production growth through 2007 we have drilled four discovery wells in the lower tertiary these include cascade in 2002 see “deepwater development” above st malo in 2003 jack in 2004 and kaskida in 2006 we currently hold 194 blocks in the lower tertiary and we have identified 21 additional prospects to date 

 

at st malo in which our working interest is 225 we expect to complete two delineation wells in 2008 at jack where our working interest is 25 we expect to complete a second appraisal well in early 2008 a second well cortez bank was drilled on the kaskida unit in 2007 and other well operations are 

planned for 2008 our working interest in kaskida is 20 and we believe kaskida is the largest of our four lower tertiary discoveries to date the kaskida discovery was our first in the keathley canyon deepwater lease area of our additional 21 lower tertiary exploration prospects we have identified 15 are on our keathley canyon acreage 

 

also in 2007 we participated in a delineation well on the mioceneaged mission deep prospect in which we have a 50 working interest we have identified 15 additional prospects in our deepwater miocene inventory to date 

 

in total we drilled one exploratory and one delineation well in the deepwater gulf of mexico in 2007 and plan to drill between 10 and 12 such wells in 2008 our working interests in these exploratory opportunities range from 20 to 50

title to properties 

 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

introduction 

 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be reviewed in conjunction with our “selected financial data” and “financial statements and supplementary data” our discussion and analysis relates to the following subjects 

 

 29 

 

overview of business 

 

devon is the largest us based independent oil and gas producer and processor of natural gas and natural gas liquids in north america our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable production and a platform for future growth over 90 percent of our production from continuing operations is from north america we also operate in selected international areas including azerbaijan brazil and china our production mix in 2007 was 64 percent natural gas and 36 percent oil and ngls such as propane butane and ethane we are currently producing 24 bcf of natural gas each day or about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in north america 

 

in managing our global operations we have an operating strategy that is focused on creating and increasing value per share key elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves growing production and exercising capital discipline we must also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks to achieve longterm success 

 

 30 

 

overview of 2007 results and outlook 

 

2007 was devon’s best year in its 20year history as a public company we achieved key operational successes and continued to execute our strategy to increase value per share as a result we delivered record amounts for earnings earnings per share and operating cash flow and also grew proved reserves to a new alltime high key measures of our financial and operating performance for 2007 as well as certain operational developments are summarized below 

 

  

operating costs increased due to the 12 growth in production inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services and the weakened us dollar compared to the canadian dollar per unit lease operating expenses increased 15 to 816 per boe 

 

during 2007 we used 62 billion of cash flow from continuing operations along with other capital resources to fund 62 billion of capital expenditures reduce debt obligations by 567 million repurchase 326 million of our common stock and pay 259 million in dividends to our stockholders we also ended the year with 17 billion of cash and shortterm investments 

 

from an operational perspective we completed another successful year with the drillbit we drilled 2440 wells with an overall 98 rate of success this success rate enabled us to increase our proved reserves by 9 to a record of 25 billion boe at the end of 2007 we added 390 mmboe of proved reserves during the year with extensions discoveries and performance revisions which was well in excess of the 224 mmboe we produced during the year consistent with our twopronged operating strategy 92 of the wells we drilled were north american development wells 

 

besides completing another successful year of drilling we also had several other key operational achievements during 2007 in the gulf of mexico we continued to build off prior years’ successful drilling results with our deepwater exploration and development program we commenced production from the merganser field and we also began drilling our first operated exploratory well in the lower tertiary trend of the gulf of mexico we also made progress toward commercial development of our four previous discoveries in the lower tertiary trend 

 

at our 100owned jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the alberta oil sands we completed construction and commenced steam injection oil production from jackfish is expected to ramp up throughout 2008 toward a peak production target of 35000 bbls per day additionally we began frontend engineering and design work on an extension of our jackfish project like the first phase this second phase of jackfish is also expected to eventually produce 35000 bbls per day 

 

finally we completed construction and fabrication of the polvo oil development project offshore brazil and began producing oil from the first of ten planned wells polvo located in the campos basin was discovered in 2004 and is our first operated development project in brazil 

in november 2006 and january 2007 we announced plans to divest our operations in egypt and west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in north america and in the deepwater gulf of mexico additionally we will sharpen our focus in north america and concentrate our international operations in brazil and china where we have established competitive advantages 

 

in october 2007 we completed the sale of our operations in egypt and received proceeds of 341 million as a result of this sale we recognized a 90 million aftertax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007 in november 2007 we announced an agreement to sell our operations in gabon for 2055 million we are finalizing purchase and sales agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government approvals for the remaining properties in the west african divestiture package we are optimistic we can complete these sales during the first half of 2008 and then primarily use the proceeds to repay our outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit facility borrowings and resume common stock repurchases 

 

looking to 2008 we announced in february 2008 that we have hedged a meaningful portion of our expected 2008 production with financial price collar and swap arrangements as of february 15 2008 approximately 62 of our expected 2008 gas production is subject to either price collars with a floor price of 750 per mmbtu and an average ceiling price of 943 per mmbtu or price swaps with an average price of 824 per mmbtu another 2 of our expected 2008 gas production is subject to fixedprice physical contracts also as of february 15 2008 approximately 12 of our expected 2008 oil production is subject to price collars with a floor price of 7000 per barrel and an average ceiling price of 14023 per barrel 

 

additionally our operational accomplishments in recent years have laid the foundation for continued growth in future years at competitive unit costs which we expect will continue to create additional value for our investors in 2008 we expect to deliver proved reserve additions of 390 to 410 million boe with related capital expenditures in the range of 61 to 64 billion we expect production to increase approximately 9 from 2007 to 2008 which reflects our significant reserve additions in recent years as well as those expected in 2008 additionally our exploration program exposes us to highimpact projects in north america and international locations that can fuel more growth in the years to come

the following table details the effects of changes in volumes and prices on our oil gas and ngl revenues between 2005 and 2007 

 

 

 

oil revenues 

 

2007 vs 2006 oil revenues increased 700 million due to a 13 million barrel increase in production the increase in our 2007 oil production was primarily due to our properties in azerbaijan where we achieved payout of certain carried interests in the last half of 2006 this led to a nine million barrel increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 production also increased 35 million barrels due to increased development activity in our 

lloydminster area in canada also oil sales from our polvo field in brazil began during the fourth quarter of 2007 which resulted in 05 million barrels of increased production 

 

oil revenues increased 359 million as a result of a 11 increase in our realized price the average nymex west texas intermediate index price increased 9 during the same time period accounting for the majority of the increase 

 

2006 vs 2005 oil revenues decreased 155 million due to a four million barrel decrease in production production lost from properties divested in 2005 caused a decrease of four million barrels and production declines related to our us and canadian properties caused a decrease of three million barrels these decreases were partially offset by a three million barrel increase from reaching payout of certain carried interests in azerbaijan 

 

oil revenues increased 795 million as a result of a 49 increase in our realized price the expiration of oil hedges at the end of 2005 and a 17 increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price caused the increase in our realized oil price 

 

gas revenues 

 

2007 vs 2006 a 55 bcf increase in production caused gas revenues to increase by 329 million our drilling and development program in the barnett shale field in north texas contributed 53 bcf to the gas production increase the june 2006 chief holdings llc “chief” acquisition also contributed 12 bcf of increased production during 2007 we also began first production from the merganser field in the deepwater gulf of mexico which resulted in seven bcf of increased production these increases and the effects of new drilling and development in our other north american properties were partially offset by natural production declines primarily in canada 

 

a 1 decline in our average realized price caused gas revenues to decrease 78 million in 2007 

 

2006 vs 2005 an 11 bcf decrease in production caused gas revenues to decrease by 77 million production lost from the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of 35 bcf as a result of hurricanes katrina rita dennis and ivan which occurred in 2005 gas volumes suspended in 2006 were three bcf more than those suspended in 2005 these decreases were partially offset by the june 2006 chief acquisition which contributed 10 bcf of production during the last half of 2006 and additional production from new drilling and development in our us onshore and offshore properties 

 

a 14 decline in average prices caused gas revenues to decrease 772 million in 2006 the 2005 average gas price was impacted by the supply disruptions caused by that year’s hurricanes 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

the details of the changes in marketing and midstream revenues operating costs and expenses and the resulting operating profit between 2005 and 2007 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 36 

 

2007 vs 2006 marketing and midstream revenues increased 64 million while operating costs and expenses decreased 9 million causing operating profit to increase 73 million revenues increased primarily due to higher prices realized on ngl sales 

 

2006 vs 2005 marketing and midstream revenues decreased 120 million and operating costs and expenses also decreased 106 million causing operating profit to decrease 14 million both revenues and expenses in 2006 decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices partially offset by the effect of higher gas pipeline throughout 

 

oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses 

 

the details of the changes in oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses between 2005 and 2007 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

  

lease operating expenses “loe” 

 

2007 vs 2006 loe increased 403 million in 2007 the largest contributor to this increase was our 12 growth in production which caused an increase of 168 million another key contributor to the loe increase was the continued effects of inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services increased demand for these services continue to drive costs higher for materials equipment and personnel used in both recurring activities as well as wellworkover projects furthermore changes in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar also caused loe to increase 40 million 

 

2006 vs 2005 loe increased 181 million in 2006 largely due to higher commodity prices commodity price increases in 2005 and the first half of 2006 contributed to industrywide inflationary pressures on materials and personnel costs additionally the availability of higher commodity prices contributed to our decision to perform more well workovers and maintenance projects to maintain or improve production volumes commodity price increases also caused operating costs such as ad valorem taxes power and fuel costs to rise 

 

a higher canadiantous dollar exchange rate in 2006 caused loe to increase 34 million loe also increased 33 million due to the june 2006 chief acquisition and the payouts of our carried interests in azerbaijan in the last half of 2006 the increases in our loe were partially offset by a decrease of 82 million related to properties that were sold in 2005 

 

the factors described above were also the primary factors causing loe per boe to increase during 2006 although we divested properties in 2005 that had higher perunit operating costs the cost escalation largely 

related to higher commodity prices and the weaker us dollar had a greater effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures 

 

production taxes 

 

the following table details the changes in production taxes between 2005 and 2007 the majority of our production taxes are assessed on our onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the changes due to revenues in the table primarily relate to changes in oil gas and ngl revenues from our us onshore properties 

 

 

 

2007 vs 2006 production taxes decreased 66 million due to a decrease in the effective production tax rate in 2007 our lower production tax rates in 2007 were primarily due to an increase in tax credits received on certain horizontal wells in the state of texas and the increase in azerbaijan revenues subsequent to the payouts of our carried interests in the last half of 2006 our azerbaijan revenues are not subject to production taxes therefore the increased revenues generated in azerbaijan in 2007 caused our overall rate of production taxes to decrease 

 

2006 vs 2005 production taxes increased 31 million due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2006 a new chinese “special petroleum gain” tax was the primary contributor to the higher rate 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties “dda” 

 

dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents our net capitalized investment plus future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

 

the changes in our production volumes dda rate per unit and dda of oil and gas properties between 2005 and 2007 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 38 

 

the following table details the increases and decreases in dda of oil and gas properties between 2005 and 2007 due to the changes in production volumes and dda rate presented in the table above 

 

 

 

2007 vs 2006 the 12 production increase caused oil and gas property related dda to increase 242 million in addition oil and gas property related dda increased 355 million due to a 15 increase in the dda rate the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2007 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors contributing to the rate increase include the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2007 drilling activities and a higher canadiantous dollar exchange rate in 2007 the effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease resulting from higher reserve estimates due to the effects of higher 2007 yearend commodity prices 

 

2006 vs 2005 the 3 production decrease caused oil and gas property related dda to decrease 51 million however oil and gas property related dda increased 342 million due to a 20 increase in the dda rate the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2006 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors contributing to the rate increase included the june 2006 chief acquisition and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2006 drilling activities a reduction in reserve estimates due to the effects of lower 2006 yearend commodity prices also contributed to the rate increase 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

 

 

 

 39 

2007 vs 2006 gross ga increased 198 million the largest contributors to this increase were higher employee compensation and benefits costs these cost increases which were related to our continued growth and industry inflation caused gross ga to increase 134 million of this increase 55 million related to higher stock compensation in addition changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate caused a 13 million increase in costs 

 

2006 vs 2005 gross ga increased 189 million higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross ga to increase 148 million of this increase 34 million represented stock option expense recognized pursuant to our adoption in 2006 of statement of financial accounting standard no 123r sharebased payment  an additional 28 million of the increase related to higher restricted stock compensation in addition changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate caused an 11 million increase in costs 

 

the factors discussed above were also the primary factors that caused the 69 million and 85 million increases in capitalized ga in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

interest expense 

 

the following schedule includes the components of interest expense between 2005 and 2007 

 

 

 

interest based on debt outstanding increased 22 million from 2006 to 2007 this increase was largely due to higher average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in 2007 than in 2006 partially offset by the effects of repaying various maturing notes in 2007 and 2006 interest based on debt outstanding decreased 21 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the repayment of various maturing notes in 2005 and 2006 partially offset by an increase in commercial paper borrowings during 2006 to fund the june 2006 chief acquisition 

 

capitalized interest increased from 2005 to 2007 primarily due to higher cumulative costs related to the development of the second phase of our jackfish heavy oil development project in canada and the construction of the related access pipeline higher development costs in the gulf of mexico and brazil also contributed to the increase 

 

during 2005 we redeemed our 400 million 675 notes due march 15 2011 and our zero coupon convertible senior debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates the other interest category in the table above includes 81 million in 2005 related to these early retirements 

 

change in fair value of financial instruments 

 

the details of the changes in fair value of financial instruments between 2005 and 2007 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

the change in the fair value of the embedded option relates to the debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron common stock these unrealized losses were caused primarily by increases in the price of chevron’s common stock 

 

effective january 1 2007 as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standard no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115  we began recognizing unrealized gains and losses on our investment in chevron common stock in net earnings rather than as part of other comprehensive income the change in fair value of our investment in chevron common stock resulted from an increase in the price of chevron’s common stock during 2007 

 

in 2005 we recognized a 39 million loss on certain oil derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual and projected production under these contracts the lower than expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that affected offshore production in the gulf of mexico 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

during 2006 and 2005 we reduced the carrying value of certain of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities a detailed description of how full cost ceiling limitations are determined is included in the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section of this report a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

 

 

2006 reductions 

 

during the second quarter of 2006 we drilled two unsuccessful exploratory wells in brazil and determined that the capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired therefore in the second quarter of 2006 we recognized a 16 million impairment of our investment in brazil equal to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no tax benefit related to this impairment the two wells were unrelated to our polvo development project in brazil 

 

as a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows the carrying value of our russian properties exceeded the full cost ceiling by 10 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006 therefore we recognized a 20 million reduction of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in russia offset by a 10 million deferred income tax benefit 

2005 reduction 

 

prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 we were capitalizing the costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in brazil pending the determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in brazil at the end of 2005 it was expected that a small initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at polvo would be recorded in 2006 based on preliminary estimates developed in the fourth quarter of 2005 the value of this initial partial booking of proved reserves was not sufficient to offset the sum of the related proportionate polvo costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts therefore we determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to the polvo project should be impaired these costs totaled approximately 42 million there was no tax benefit related to this brazilian impairment 

 

other income net 

 

the following schedule includes the components of other income between 2005 and 2007 

 

 

 

interest and dividend income decreased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in incomeearning cash and investment balances partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate on our investment in chevron common stock interest and dividend income increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an increase in cash and shortterm investment balances and higher interest rates 

 

during 2005 we sold certain noncore midstream assets for a net gain of 150 million also during 2005 we incurred a 55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end of their original term these hedges related to us and canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005 property divestiture program this loss was partially offset by a 7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction with the early redemption of the 400 million 675 senior notes in 2005 

 

income taxes 

 

the following table presents our total income tax expense related to continuing operations and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate for each of the past three years the primary factors causing our effective rates to vary from 2005 to 2007 and differ from the us statutory rate are discussed below 

 

 

in 2007 2006 and 2005 deferred income taxes were reduced 261 million 243 million and 14 million respectively due to successive canadian statutory rate reductions that were enacted in each such year 

 

in 2006 deferred income taxes increased 39 million due to the effect of a new incomebased tax enacted by the state of texas that replaced a previous franchise tax the new tax was effective january 1 2007 

 

in 2005 we recognized 28 million of taxes related to our repatriation of 545 million to the united states the cash was repatriated to take advantage of us tax legislation that allowed qualifying companies to repatriate cash from foreign operations at a reduced income tax rate substantially all of the cash repatriated by us in 2005 related to prior earnings of our canadian subsidiary 

 

earnings from discontinued operations 

 

in november 2006 and january 2007 we announced our plans to divest our operations in egypt and west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations we have classified all 2007 and prior period amounts related to our operations in egypt and west africa as discontinued operations 

 

in october 2007 we completed the sale of our egyptian operations and received proceeds of 341 million as a result of this sale we recognized a 90 million aftertax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007 in november 2007 we announced an agreement to sell our operations in gabon for 2055 million we are finalizing purchase and sales agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government approvals for the remaining properties in the west african divestiture package we are optimistic we can complete these sales during the first half of 2008 

 

following are the components of earnings from discontinued operations between 2005 and 2007 

 

 

 

2007 vs 2006 earnings from discontinued operations increased 248 million in 2007 in addition to variances caused by changes in production volumes and realized prices our earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 were impacted by other significant factors pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations we ceased recording dda in november 2006 related to our egyptian operations and in january 2007 related to our west african operations this reduction in dda caused earnings from discontinued operations to increase 119 million in 2007 earnings in 2007 also benefited from the 90 million gain from the sale of our egyptian operations 

 

in addition earnings from discontinued operations increased 90 million in 2007 due to the net effect of reductions in carrying value in 2006 and 2007 our earnings in 2007 were reduced by 13 million from these reductions compared to 103 million of reductions recorded in 2006 due to unsuccessful drilling activities in nigeria in the first quarter of 2006 we recognized an 85 million impairment of our investment in nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no income tax benefit related to this impairment as a result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in egypt during 2006 the net book value of our egyptian oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the ceiling by 18 million as of the end of september 30 2006 therefore in 2006 we recognized an 18 million aftertax loss 31 million pretax in the second quarter of 2007 based on drilling activities in nigeria we recognized a 13 million aftertax loss 64 million pretax 

 

2006 vs 2005 earnings from discontinued operations increased 179 million in 2006 this increase was largely due to an increase in realized crude oil prices partially offset by a 19 decline in oil production 

in addition earnings from discontinued operations increased 16 million due to the net effect of a 119 million aftertax impairment of our investment in angola in 2005 partially offset by the 2006 nigerian and egyptian impairments totaling 103 million as described above our interests in angola were acquired through the 2003 ocean energy merger and our angolan drilling program discovered no proven reserves after drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that all of the angolan capitalized costs should be impaired as a result we recognized a 170 million impairment with a 51 million related tax benefit 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

the following discussion of capital resources uses and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from 2005 to 2007 the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis therefore these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document additional discussion of these items follows the table 

 

 

 

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be our primary source of capital and liquidity in 2007 changes in operating cash flow are largely due to the same factors that affect 

our net earnings with the exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as dda financial instrument fair value changes property impairments and deferred income tax expense as a result our operating cash flow increased in 2007 primarily due to the increase in earnings as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

 

during 2007 and 2006 operating cash flow was primarily used to fund our capital expenditures excluding the 20 billion chief acquisition in june 2006 our operating cash flow was sufficient to fund our 2007 and 2006 capital expenditures during 2005 operating cash flow was sufficient to fund our 2005 capital expenditures and 13 billion of debt repayments 

 

other sources of cash 

 

as needed we utilize cash on hand and access our available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program as sources of cash to supplement our operating cash flow additionally we invest in highly liquid shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances as needed we may reduce such shortterm investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow 

 

during 2007 we borrowed 15 billion under our unsecured revolving line of credit and reduced our shortterm investment balances by 202 million we also received 341 million of proceeds from the sale of our egyptian operations these sources of cash were used primarily to fund net commercial paper repayments longterm debt repayments common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

during 2006 we borrowed 18 billion under our commercial paper program and reduced our shortterm investment balances by 106 million these sources of cash were largely used to fund the 20 billion acquisition of chief in june 2006 also during 2006 we supplemented operating cash flow with cash on hand which was used to fund scheduled longterm debt maturities common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred stock 

 

during 2005 we generated 22 billion in pretax proceeds from sales of property and equipment these consisted of 20 billion related to the sale of noncore oil and gas properties and 164 million related to the sale of noncore midstream assets net of related income taxes these proceeds were 20 billion during 2005 we also reduced shortterm investment balances by 287 million these sources of cash were used primarily to repurchase 23 billion of common stock 

 

capital expenditures 

 

our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations our midstream operations and other corporate activities the vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 57 billion 68 billion and 36 billion in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 capital expenditures included 20 billion related to the acquisition of the chief properties excluding the effect of the chief acquisition the increase in such capital expenditures from 2005 to 2007 was due to inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field services and increased drilling activities in the barnett shale gulf of mexico carthage and groesbeck areas of the united states additionally capital expenditures also increased on our properties in azerbaijan where we achieved payout of certain carried interests in the last half of 2006 

 

our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines these midstream facilities exist primarily to support our oil and gas development operations such expenditures were 371 million 357 million and 121 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the majority of our midstream expenditures from 2005 to 2007 have related to development activities in the barnett shale the woodford shale in eastern oklahoma and jackfish in canada 

 

debt repayments 

 

during 2007 we repaid the 400 million 4375 notes which matured on october 1 2007 also during 2007 certain holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares 

of chevron common stock prior to the debentures’ august 15 2008 maturity date we have the option in lieu of delivering shares of chevron common stock to pay exchanging debenture holders an amount of cash equal to the market value of chevron common stock we paid 167 million in cash to debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights this amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value of 105 million and a 62 million reduction of the related embedded derivative option’s balance 

 

during 2006 we retired the 500 million 275 notes and the 178 million 200 million canadian 655 we also repaid 180 million of debt acquired in the chief acquisition 

 

during 2005 we spent 08 billion to retire zero coupon convertible debentures due in 2020 and 400 million 675 notes due in 2011 before their scheduled maturity dates we also spent 04 billion to repay various notes that matured in 2005 

 

repurchases of common stock 

 

during the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 we repurchased 552 million shares at a total cost of 28 billion or 5149 per share under various repurchase programs during 2007 we repurchased 41 million shares at a cost of 326 million or 7980 per share during 2006 we repurchased 42 million shares at a cost of 253 million or 5961 per share during 2005 we repurchased 469 million shares at a cost of 23 billion or 4828 per share 

 

dividends 

 

our common stock dividends were 249 million 199 million and 136 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we also paid 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2007 2006 and 2005 the increases in common stock dividends from 2005 to 2007 were primarily related to 25 and 50 increases in the quarterly dividend rate in the first quarters of 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase from 2005 to 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares due to share repurchases 

 

liquidity 

 

historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and longterm debt during 2008 another major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our operations in west africa we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments common stock repurchases and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

 

operating cash flow 

 

our operating cash flow has increased approximately 16 since 2005 reaching a total of 62 billion in 2007 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

 

we periodically deem it appropriate to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices accordingly we have utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of our production we have also utilized various price swap contracts and fixedprice physical delivery contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production based on contracts in place as of february 15 2008 in 2008 approximately 64 of our estimated natural gas production and 12 of our estimated oil production are subject to either price collars swaps or fixedprice contracts the key terms of these contracts are summarized in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases as experienced in recent years can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow 

 

credit availability 

 

we have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program which we can access to provide liquidity at december 31 2007 our total available borrowing capacity was 13 billion 

 

our 25 billion fiveyear syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” matures on april 7 2012 and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders 

 

the senior credit facility includes a fiveyear revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2007 there were 14 billion of borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 527 

 

on august 7 2007 we established a new 15 billion 364day syndicated unsecured revolving senior credit facility the “shortterm facility” this facility provides us with provisional interim liquidity until we receive the proceeds from divestitures of assets in west africa the shortterm facility was also used to support an increase in our commercial paper program from 2 billion to 35 billion 

 

the shortterm facility matures on august 5 2008 at that time all amounts outstanding will be due and payable unless the maturity is extended prior to august 5 2008 we have the option to convert any outstanding principal amount of loans under the shortterm facility to a term loan which will be repayable in a single payment on august 4 2009 

 

amounts borrowed under the shortterm facility bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months such rates are generally less than the prime rate we may also elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2007 there were no borrowings under the shortterm facility 

 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 35 billion also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility or the shortterm facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of december 31 2007 we had 10 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 507 

 

the senior credit facility and shortterm facility contain only one material financial covenant this covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements as defined in the agreement total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with this covenant our debttocapitalization ratio at december 31 2007 as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement was 238 

 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility and shortterm facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations 

properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our credit facilities include covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

 

debt ratings 

 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a positive outlook by standard  poor’s baa1 with a stable outlook by moody’s and bbb with a positive outlook by fitch 

 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility and shortterm facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our credit facilities under the terms of the senior credit facility and the shortterm facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs for the credit facilities from libor plus 35 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 45 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2007 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies

in february 2008 we provided guidance for our 2008 capital expenditures which are expected to range from 66 billion to 70 billion this represents the largest planned use of our 2008 operating cash flow with the high end of the range being 13 higher than our 2007 capital expenditures to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2008 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2008 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2008 and the commodity price collars swaps and fixedprice contracts we have in place we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2008 capital expenditures 

 

common stock repurchase programs 

 

we have an ongoing annual stock repurchase program to minimize dilution resulting from restricted stock issued to and options exercised by employees in 2008 the repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up to 48 million shares or a cost of 422 million whichever amount is reached first 

 

in anticipation of the completion of our west african divestitures our board of directors has approved a separate program to repurchase up to 50 million shares this program expires on december 31 2009 

 

exchangeable debentures 

 

as of december 31 2007 our outstanding debt included debentures that are exchangeable for chevron common stock these debentures have a scheduled maturity date of august 15 2008 although these debentures are now due within one year we continue to classify this debt as longterm because we have the intent and ability to refinance these debentures on a longterm basis with the available capacity under our existing credit facilities or other longterm financing arrangements 

canadian royalties 

 

on october 25 2007 the alberta government proposed increases to the royalty rates on oil and natural gas production beginning in 2009 we believe this proposal would reduce future earnings and cash flows from our oil and gas properties located in alberta additionally assuming all other factors are equal higher royalty rates would likely result in lower levels of capital investment in alberta relative to our other areas of operation however the magnitude of the potential impact which will depend on the final form of enacted legislation and other factors that impact the relative expected economic returns of capital projects cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 is provided in the following table

pension funding and estimates 

 

funded status as compared to the “projected benefit obligation” our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 230 million and 178 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2007 changes to our underfunded status is included in note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 230 million underfunded status at the end of 2007 198 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans that have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2007 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 59 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

as compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation” our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by 62 million at december 31 2007 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels our current intentions are to provide sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated benefit obligation remains fully funded the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets and payments made to participants required contributions also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period particularly the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2008 we anticipate the accumulated benefit obligation will remain fully funded without contributing to our qualified defined benefit plans therefore we don’t expect to contribute to the plans during 2008 

 

pension estimate assumptions our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 41 million 31 million and 26 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 61 million in 2008 

the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

 

we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 840 at both december 31 2007 and 2006 we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets the target investment allocation for our plan assets is 50 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 840 to 740 would increase the expected 2008 pension expense by 6 million 

 

we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 622 and 572 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled considering the expected timing of future cash flows related to the plans this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 622 to 597 would increase our pension liability at december 31 2007 by 28 million and increase estimated 2008 pension expense by 4 million 

 

at december 31 2007 we had actuarial losses of 208 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages we estimate that approximately 14 million and 12 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2008 and 2009 respectively the 14 million estimated to be recognized in 2008 is a component of the total estimated 2008 pension expense of 61 million referred to earlier in this section 

 

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

 

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act was signed into law beginning in 2008 this act will cause extensive changes in the determination of both the minimum required contribution and the maximum tax deductible limit because the new required contribution will approximate our current policy of fully funding the accumulated benefit obligation the changes are not expected to have a significant impact on future cash flows 

 

contingencies and legal matters 

 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

 

the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

full cost ceiling calculations 

 

policy description 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 

 

if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 1 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely therefore the 

future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs rather they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment this adjustment requires little judgment as the endofperiod price is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges none of our outstanding derivative contracts at december 31 2007 qualified for hedge accounting treatment 

 

because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile on any particular day at the end of a quarter prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

derivative financial instruments 

 

policy description 

 

the majority of our historical derivative instruments have consisted of commodity financial instruments used to manage our cash flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility we have also entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility the interest rate swaps mitigate either the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on interest expense for variablerate debt instruments or the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixedrate debt we also have an embedded option derivative related to the fair value of our debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock 

 

all derivatives are recognized at their current fair value on our balance sheet changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met if such criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity until the hedged transaction occurs the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations if hedge accounting criteria are met for fair value hedges the change in the fair value is recorded in the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item 

 

a derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of an acquisition or business combination that includes derivative contracts additionally we must document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the instrument we must also assess both at the instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the hedged item 

 

for the derivative financial instruments we have executed in 2006 2007 and to date in 2008 we have chosen to not meet the necessary criteria to qualify such instruments for hedge accounting 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments require substantial judgment for these instruments we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter in addition we estimate the option value of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional price differentials and interest 

rates fair values of our other derivative instruments require less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers 

 

quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal impact on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations as long as the derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can have a significant impact on our results of operations but generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

business combinations 

 

policy description 

 

from our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003 we grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 

 

under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies endofperiod price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the 

discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

 

generally in our business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that we assume in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

 

except for the 2002 acquisition of mitchell energy  development corp our mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

 

the mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that we also acquired from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

 

in addition to the valuation methods described above we perform other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

 

in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination we compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently we compare these comparable transaction multiples to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

 

while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower 

future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it is a noncash charge but it would adversely affect results of operations as discussed in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital resources uses and liquidity” in calculating our debttocapitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

 

our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years our annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

 

valuation of goodwill 

 

policy description 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

 

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r business combinations  which replaces statement no 141 statement no 141r retains the fundamental requirements of statement no 141 that an acquirer be identified and the acquisition method of accounting previously called the purchase method be used for all business combinations statement no 141r’s scope is broader than that of statement no 141 which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses statement no 141r improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports statement no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as well as any resulting goodwill statement no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we will evaluate how the new requirements of statement no 141r would impact any business combinations completed in 2009 or thereafter 

in december 2007 the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51  a noncontrolling interest sometimes called a minority interest is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent statement no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary under statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary must be reported as a component of consolidated equity separate from the parent’s equity additionally the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest must be reported separately on the face of the income statement statement no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited we do not expect the adoption of statement no 160 to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 

 

2008 estimates 

 

the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on our examination of historical operating trends the information that was used to prepare the december 31 2007 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties these forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil natural gas and ngls during 2008 will be substantially similar to those of 2007 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2008 exchange rate of 098 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

 

in january 2007 we announced our intent to divest our west african oil and gas assets and terminate our operations in west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire gabon and other countries in the region in november 2007 we announced an agreement to sell our operations in gabon for 2055 million we are finalizing purchase and sales agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government approvals for the remaining properties in this divestiture package we are optimistic we can complete these sales during the first half of 2008 

 

all west african related revenues expenses and capital will be reported as discontinued operations in our 2008 financial statements accordingly all forwardlooking estimates in the following discussion exclude amounts related to our operations in west africa unless otherwise noted 

 

though we have completed several major property acquisitions and dispositions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus the following forwardlooking estimates do not include any financial and operating effects of potential property acquisitions or divestitures that may occur during 2008 except for west africa as previously discussed 

 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

set forth below are our estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2008 we estimate that our combined 2008 oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 240 to 247 mmboe of this total approximately 92 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2007 the following estimates for oil gas and ngl production are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total production 

 

 

oil and gas prices 

 

oil and gas operating area prices 

 

we expect our 2008 average prices for the oil and gas production from each of our operating areas to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table these expected ranges are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the oil and gas financial contracts presented in the “commodity price risk management” section below 

 

the nymex price for oil is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma the nymex price for gas is determined to be the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

 

 

 

commodity price risk management 

 

from time to time we enter into nymexrelated financial commodity collar and price swap contracts such contracts are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas price volatility although these financial contracts do not relate to specific production from our operating areas they will affect our overall revenues and average realized oil and gas prices in 2008 

 

the key terms of our 2008 oil and gas financial collar and price swap contracts are presented in the following tables the tables include contracts entered into as of february 15 2008 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that monthly nymex prices in 2008 differ from those established by the gas price swaps or are outside of the ranges established by the oil and natural gas collars we and the counterparties to the contracts will settle the difference such settlements will either increase or decrease our oil and gas revenues for the period also we will marktomarket the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2008 changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as increases or decreases to our oil and gas revenues the expected ranges of our realized oil and gas prices as a percentage of nymex prices which are presented earlier in this document do not include any estimates of the impact on our oil and gas prices from monthly settlements or changes in the fair values of our oil and gas price swaps and collars 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of gas and ngls provisions of contractual agreements and the amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes 

 

these factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that our 2008 marketing and midstream operating profit will be between 510 million and 550 million we estimate that marketing and midstream revenues will be between 161 billion and 201 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 110 billion and 146 billion 

 

production and operating expenses 

 

our production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties the amount of repair and workover activity required and changes in production tax rates oil gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

 

given these uncertainties we expect that our 2008 lease operating expenses will be between 217 billion to 224 billion additionally we estimate that our production taxes for 2008 will be between 35 and 40 of total oil gas and ngl revenues excluding the effect on revenues from financial collars and price swap contracts upon which production taxes are not assessed 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

our 2008 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2008 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts and the revisions to our yearend 2007 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2008 

 

given these uncertainties we estimate that our oil and gas propertyrelated dda rate will be between 1275 per boe and 1325 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2008 is expected to be between 309 billion and 320 billion 

 

additionally we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets will total between 260 million and 270 million in 2008 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2008 is expected to be between 75 million and 85 million 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

 

given these limitations we estimate our ga for 2008 will be between 590 million and 610 million this estimate includes approximately 90 million of noncash sharebased compensation net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates” reductions to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our quarterly reporting periods due to the uncertain nature of future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices we are not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in 2008 

 

interest expense 

 

future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2008 from sales of oil gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow likewise we can only marginally influence the timing of the closing of our west african divestitures and the attendant cash receipts these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense other factors that affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally within our control 

 

based on the information related to interest expense set forth below we expect our 2008 interest expense to be between 340 million and 350 million this estimate assumes no material changes in prevailing interest rates this estimate also assumes no material changes in our expected level of indebtedness except for an assumption that our commercial paper and credit facility borrowings will decrease in conjunction with the planned divestiture of our west african operations which we are optimistic will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2008 

 

the interest expense in 2008 related to our fixedrate debt including net accretion of related discounts will be approximately 385 million this fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but not all of our longterm debt 

 

our floating rate debt is comprised of variablerate commercial paper and borrowings against our senior credit facility our floating rate debt is summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 60 

 

  

based on estimates of future libor and prime rates as of december 31 2007 interest expense on floating rate debt including net amortization of premiums is expected to total between 70 million and 80 million in 2008 

 

our interest expense totals include payments of facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding we expect between 5 million and 15 million of such items to be included in our 2008 interest expense also we expect to capitalize between 120 million and 130 million of interest during 2008 including amounts related to our discontinued operations 

 

other income 

 

we estimate that our other income in 2008 will be between 55 million and 75 million 

 

as of the end of 2007 we had received insurance claim settlements related to the 2005 hurricanes that were 150 million in excess of amounts incurred to repair related damages none of this 150 million excess has been recognized as income pending the resolution of the amount of future necessary repairs and the settlement of certain claims that have been filed with secondary insurers based on the most recent estimates of our costs for repairs we believe that some amount will ultimately be recorded as other income however the timing and amount that would be recorded as other income are uncertain therefore the 2008 estimate for other income above does not include any amount related to hurricane proceeds 

 

income taxes 

 

our financial income tax rate in 2008 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2008 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2008 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced 

 

given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect that our consolidated financial income tax rate in 2008 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 15 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 10 and 25 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2008 financial income tax rates 

 

discontinued operations 

 

as previously discussed in november 2007 we announced an agreement to sell our operations in gabon for 2055 million we are finalizing purchase and sales agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government approvals for the remaining properties in the west african divestiture package we are optimistic we can complete these sales during the first half of 2008 

 

the following table presents the 2008 estimates for production production and operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with these discontinued operations these estimates include amounts related to 

all assets in the west african divestiture package for the first half of 2008 pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations the west african assets are not subject to dda during 2008 

 

 

 

year 2008 potential capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

capital expenditures 

 

though we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not “budget” nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions 

 

our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for our future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2008 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

 

given the limitations discussed above the following table shows expected drilling development and facilities expenditures by geographic area development capital includes development activity related to reserves classified as proved as of yearend 2007 and drilling activity in areas that do not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

 

 

 

in addition to the above expenditures for drilling development and facilities we expect to spend between 325 million to 375 million on our marketing and midstream assets which primarily include our oil pipelines gas processing plants and gas pipeline systems we expect to capitalize between 335 million and 345 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 110 million and 120 million of interest we also expect to pay between 70 million and 80 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 130 million and 140 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets 

 

other cash uses 

 

our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 014 per share quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2007 dividends are expected to approximate 250 million also we have 150 million of 649 cumulative preferred stock upon which we will pay 10 million of dividends in 2008 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

our estimated 2008 cash uses including our drilling and development activities retirement of debt and repurchase of common stock are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of existing cash and shortterm investments operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of our assets in west africa any remaining cash uses could be funded by increasing our borrowings under our commercial paper program or with borrowings from the available capacity under our credit facilities which was approximately 13 billion at december 31 2007 the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2008 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however we expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2008 if significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year we could utilize our existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing 

 

our 372 million of shortterm investments as of december 31 2007 consisted entirely of auction rate securities collateralized by student loans which are substantially guaranteed by the united states government subsequent to december 31 2007 we have reduced our auction rate securities holdings to 153 million however beginning on february 8 2008 we experienced difficulty selling additional securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provides liquidity to these securities the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every 28 days until the auction succeeds the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature accordingly there may be no effective mechanism for selling these securities and the securities we own may become longterm investments at this time we do not believe such securities are impaired or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

 

commodity price risk 

 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” 

 

we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through various financial transactions that hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars we will settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 

 

based on natural gas contracts in place as of february 15 2008 we have approximately 16 bcf per day of gas production in 2008 that is subject to either price swaps or collars or fixedprice contracts this amount represents approximately 64 of our estimated 2008 gas production or 40 of our total boe production all of these price swap and collar contracts expire december 31 2008 as of february 15 2008 we do not have any gas price swaps or collars extending beyond 2008 however our fixedprice physical delivery contracts 

extend through 2011 these physical delivery contracts relate to our canadian natural gas production and range from six bcf to 14 bcf per year these physical delivery contracts are not expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices from 2009 through 2011 

 

the key terms of our 2008 gas financial collar and price swap contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

based on oil contracts in place as of february 15 2008 we have approximately 22000 bbls per day of oil production in 2008 that is subject to price collars this amount represents approximately 12 of our estimated 2008 oil production or 3 of our total boe production all of these price collar contracts expire december 31 2008 as of february 15 2008 we do not have any oil price swaps or collars extending beyond 2008 

 

the key terms of our 2008 oil financial collar contracts are presented in the following table 

 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

at december 31 2007 we had debt outstanding of 79 billion of this amount 55 billion or 69 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 73 additionally we had 10 billion of outstanding commercial paper and 14 billion of credit facility borrowings bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 507 and 527 respectively at the end of 2007 and as of february 15 2008 we did not have any interest rate hedging instruments 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2007 balance sheet

based on their evaluation devon’s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that devon’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 were effective as of december 31 2007 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by devon in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms 

 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

devon’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for devon as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 under the supervision and with the participation of devon’s management including our principal executive and principal financial officers devon conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso framework” based on this evaluation under the coso framework which was completed on february 5 2008 management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 

 

the effectiveness of devon’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm who audited devon’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 as stated in their report which is included under “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there was no change in devon’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect devon’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas we own oil and gas properties principally in the united states and canada and to a lesser degree various regions located outside north america including azerbaijan brazil and china we also own properties in west africa and egypt that we intend to sell in 2007 in addition to our oil and gas operations we have marketing and midstream operations primarily in north america these include marketing natural gas crude oil and ngls and constructing and operating pipelines storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of our significant properties and associated 2006 developments can be found under “item 2 properties” 

 

we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 our common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in october 2004 we transferred our common stock listing to the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

 

strategy 

 

we have a twopronged operating strategy first we invest the vast majority of our capital budget in lowrisk exploitation and development projects on our extensive north american property base which provides reliable and repeatable production and reserves additions to supplement that strategy we annually invest a measured amount of capital in highimpact long cycletime projects to replenish our development inventory for the future the philosophy that underlies the execution of this strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by 

 

  

development of business 

 

during 1988 we expanded our capital base with our first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years this expansion is attributable to both a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling program total proved reserves increased from 8 mmboe 1 at yearend 1987 to 2376 mmboe 2 at yearend 2006 

 

during the same time period we have grown proved reserves from 066 boe 1 per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 530 boe 2 per diluted share at the end of 2006 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 12 we have also increased production from 009 boe 1 per diluted share in 1987 to 048 boe 2 per diluted share in 2006 for a compound annual growth rate of 9 this per share growth is a direct result of successful execution of our strategic plan and other key transactions and events 

 

 

1 excludes the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for as poolings of interests 

2 excludes reserves in egypt that are held for sale and classified as discontinued operations as of december 31 2006 

 

we achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our operations during 2006 including those discussed below 

 

  

in addition to production growth our us onshore properties also demonstrated significant growth in proved reserves us onshore production in 2006 of 110 mmboe was more than offset by 265 mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries during the year as well as 105 mmboe added through acquisitions primarily the chief acquisition the additional reserves added by drilling and acquisition activities caused our 2006 us onshore proved reserves to increase 21 compared to the end of 2005 

 

  

specific gulf of mexico developments in 2006 included the following 

 

  

 6 

 

  

on november 14 2006 we announced our plans to divest our operations in egypt at december 31 2006 our egyptian operations had proved reserves of eight million boe subsequently on january 23 2007 we announced our plans to divest our operations in west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire and other countries in the region at december 31 2006 our west african operations had proved reserves of 90 million boe we anticipate completing the sale of our egyptian operations in the first half of 2007 and our west african operations in the third quarter of 2007 divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in north america and in the deepwater gulf of mexico additionally we will sharpen our focus in north america and concentrate our international operations in brazil and china where we have established competitive advantages 

 

pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations our egyptian operations were classified as discontinued operations at the end of 2006 accordingly we have classified all amounts related to our operations in egypt as discontinued therefore all amounts for all periods presented in this document related to our continuing operations exclude egypt our west african operations did not meet the criteria to be considered discontinued operations at the end of 2006 therefore all amounts related to our operations in west africa are still presented in this document as part of our continuing operations beginning in 2007 our operations in west africa will be considered and classified as discontinued 

 

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

 

notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

 

oil and natural gas marketing 

 

the spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements fixedprice contracts or firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

oil marketing 

 

our oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties all of our oil production is sold at variable or marketsensitive prices 

 

natural gas marketing 

 

our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2007 approximately 75 of our natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 23 of our production was committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices our remaining gas production was sold under longterm fixed price contracts 

 

marketing and midstream activities 

 

the primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil and gas production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant marketing and midstream asset is the bridgeport 

processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area 

 

our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by 

 

  

our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 

  

customers 

 

we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

 

the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

 

during 2006 revenues received from exxonmobil and its affiliates were 11 billion or 10 of our consolidated revenues no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2005 or 2004 

 

seasonal nature of business 

 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

 

government regulation 

 

the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 

 

the following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the united states canada and other international locations in which we operate 

 

exploration and production regulation 

 

our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations including regulations related to the acquisition of seismic data the location of wells drilling and casing of wells well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes the plugging and abandoning of wells the transportation of production and in international operations minimum investments in the country of operations 

 

our operations are also subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit the rate of production allowable from oil and natural gas wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties in the united states some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

 

certain of our us oil and natural gas leases are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the bureau of land management and the minerals management service “mms” of the department of the interior such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission also has jurisdiction over certain us offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

 

royalties and incentives in canada 

 

the royalty system in canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the federal and provincial governments of canada have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues earnings and cash flow 

 

pricing and marketing in canada 

 

an order from canada’s national energy board “neb” is required for oil and natural gas exports from canada any oil or natural gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract of a certain duration or covering a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb which requires the approval of the government of canada exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers provided that the export contracts meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability transportation arrangements and market considerations 

 

investment canada act 

 

the investment canada act requires government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

 

production sharing contracts 

 

many of our international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years pscs also generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions as a result at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs generally allow the government partner to retain higher fractions of revenue 

 

environmental and occupational regulations 

 

we are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health and the discharge of materials into and the protection of the environment environmental laws and regulations relate to among other things assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste materials the monitoring abandonment reclamation and remediation of well and other sites including sites of former operations and the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems are required to be implemented for some international oil and gas operations 

 

in 1997 numerous countries participated in an international conference under the united nations framework convention on climate change and adopted an agreement known as the kyoto protocol the “protocol” the protocol became effective february 14 2005 and requires reductions of certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases certain countries in which we operate but not the united states have ratified the protocol presently it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve such emissions reductions but such expenditures could be substantial in 2006 devon published its corporate climate change position and strategy key components of the strategy include initiation of energy conservation measures tracking emerging climate changes legislation and publication of a corporate greenhouse gas emission inventory by the end of 2007 all provisions of the strategy are in progress 

 

we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business with the efforts of our environmental health and safety department we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental and safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy we anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment while our unreimbursed expenditures in 2006 concerning such matters were immaterial we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

 

we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however we do not maintain 100 coverage concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a violation of law 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 4600 employees we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees 

 

competition

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks although we have a diversified asset base a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital expenditure and investment programs and to pay dividends if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition andor liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

 

oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile 

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil natural gas and ngls a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves revenues and operating cash flows as well as the level of planned drilling activities such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future growth historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve 

estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability additional discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — proved reserves and estimated future net revenue” 

 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

 

the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

 

substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons we are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries we have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur capital expenditures even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures 

 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls higher recent commodity prices have increased drilling and operating costs of existing properties higher prices have also increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of publicly traded companies and privateequity firms with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours and they have also established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

 

our operations outside north america are based primarily in azerbaijan brazil china and various countries in west africa as a result we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties that are less prevalent for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

 

the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines 

production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

 

government laws and regulations can change 

 

our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in the united states canada and the other international countries in which we operate in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces and local governments pursuant to such legislation numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such legislation have affected and at times in the future could affect our future operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could significantly impact our profitability while such legislation can change at any time in the future those laws and regulations outside north america to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change 

 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

 

as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state provincial local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 

 

insurance does not cover all risks 

 

exploration development production and processing of oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us due to changes in the marketplace following the 2005 hurricanes in the gulf of mexico we currently have only a de minimis amount of coverage for any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the gulf of mexico

substantially all of our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in our core operating areas these interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

 

we also have certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the barnett shale region in north texas these assets include approximately 2700 miles of pipeline two gas processing plants with 680 mmcf per day of total capacity and a 15 mbbls per day ngl fractionator 

 

proved reserves and estimated future net revenue 

 

the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on escalations based upon future conditions 

 

the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” our policies also require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators “qres” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards a list of our qres is kept by the senior advisor — corporate reserves all qres are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

 

the group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and certification and includes the manager — ep budgets and reserves and the senior advisor — corporate reserves the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the vice president — planning and evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the group and reports to the president of devon no portion of the group’s compensation is dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

 

throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants discussed below 

 

in addition to internal audits we engage three independent petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of our proved reserves ryder scott company lp prepared the 2006 reserves estimates for all our offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 99 of our international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the 2006 reserves estimates for 87 of our domestic onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants prepared estimates covering 46 of our 2006 canadian reserves and audited an additional 39 of our canadian reserves 

 

set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

“prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

 

in addition to internal and external reviews three independent members of our board of directors have been assigned to a reserves committee the reserves committee meets at lease twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants the reserves committee assists the board of directors with the oversight of the following

the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and the related estimated pretax future net revenues pretax 10 present value and aftertax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december 31 2006 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein

these amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect for each individual property as of december 31 2006 these prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts these assumptions yield average prices over the life of our properties of 4611 per bbl of oil 506 per mcf of natural gas and 2763 per bbl of ngls these prices compare to the december 31 2006 nymex cash price of 6105 per bbl for crude oil and the henry hub spot price of 564 per mmbtu for natural gas 

 

the present value of aftertax future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum “standardized measure” was 166 billion at the end of 2006 included as part of standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of 75 billion excluding these taxes the present value of our pretax future net revenue “pretax 10 present value” was 241 billion we believe the pretax 10 present value is a useful measure in addition to the aftertax standardized measure the pretax 10 present value assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies the aftertax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company while the pretax 10 present value is based on prices and discount factors which are more consistent from company to company we also understand that securities analysts use the pretax 10 present value measure in similar ways 

 

3 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

as presented in the previous table we had 1674 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2006 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2006 

 

 

 

no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except in filings with the sec and 

the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

 

the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2006 there can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

 

production revenue and price history 

 

certain information concerning oil natural gas and ngl production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other third party interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2006 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

operation of properties 

 

the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

 

we are the operator of 22434 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

 

organization structure and property profiles 

 

our properties are located within the us onshore and offshore regions canada and certain locations outside north america the following table presents proved reserve information for our significant properties as of december 31 2006 along with their production volumes for the year 2006 included in the table are certain us offshore properties which currently have no proved reserves or production such properties are considered significant because they may be the source of significant growth in proved reserves and production in the future also included in the table are properties located in west africa that we intend to sale in 2007 the table does not include our egyptian operations that were classified as discontinued at the end of 2006 additional summary profile information for our significant properties is provided following the table

us offshore 

 

deepwater producing  — our assets in the gulf of mexico include four significant producing properties located in deep water greater than 600 feet these properties are magnolia nansen red hawk and zia they are all located on federal leases and total approximately 48000 net acres the properties produce both crude oil and natural gas our working interest is 65 in zia and 50 in each of the other three properties 

we drilled a total of two gross deepwater producing wells in 2006 and expect to drill four additional gross wells in 2007 

 

deepwater development  — in addition to our four significant deepwater producing properties we are in the process of developing two other deepwater projects merganser and cascade merganser and cascade are located on federal leases encompassing a total of approximately 11500 net acres we have 50 working interests in both properties 

 

we drilled two producing wells at merganser in 2006 these wells are expected to commence producing natural gas in mid2007 no additional drilling is planned at merganser 

 

we announced in 2006 our plans to develop the 2002 cascade discovery using an fpso vessel cascade is expected to begin producing primarily oil in late 2009 additional drilling at cascade is in the planning stage 

 

deepwater exploration  — our exploration program in the gulf of mexico is focused primarily on deepwater opportunities our deepwater exploratory prospects include mioceneaged objectives five million to 24 million years and older and deeper lower tertiary objectives we hold federal leases comprising approximately 12 million net acres in our deepwater exploration inventory 

 

in 2006 various drilling and testing operations provided evidence that our lower tertiary properties may be a source of meaningful reserve and production growth in the future prior to 2006 we had drilled three discovery wells in the lower tertiary these include cascade in 2002 see “deepwater development” above st malo in 2003 and jack in 2004 operations in 2006 included a successful production test of the jack no 2 well and participation in the kaskida discovery which is our fourth lower tertiary discovery we currently hold 273 blocks in the lower tertiary and have identified 19 additional prospects to date 

 

at st malo in which our working interest is 225 we plan to drill a second delineation well in late 2007 or early 2008 at jack where our working interest is 25 we continue to evaluate with our partners our development options following the successful production test in 2006 

 

in addition to the 2006 kaskida discovery a subsequent sidetrack well at kaskida was drilled in 2006 and another well operation is planned for 2007 our working interest in kaskida is 20 and we believe kaskida is the largest of our four lower tertiary discoveries to date the kaskida discovery was our first in the keathley canyon deepwater lease area twelve of the 19 additional lower tertiary exploratory prospects we have identified to date are on our keathley canyon acreage 

 

also in 2006 we participated in a miocene discovery on the mission deep prospect in which we have a 50 working interest we have fifteen additional prospects in our deepwater miocene inventory 

 

in total we drilled three exploratory and delineation wells in the deepwater gulf of mexico in 2006 and plan to drill six such wells in 2007 our working interests in these exploratory opportunities range from 20 to 100 

 

canada 

 

jackfish  — we are currently developing our 100owned jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the nonconventional oil sands of east central alberta we will employ steamassisted gravity drainage at jackfish and we expect to begin steam injection in the second quarter of 2007 production is expected to eventually reach 35000 barrels per day by the end of 2008 we drilled 19 pairs of producing and steaminjection wells in 2006 bringing the total number of wellpairs to 24 we hold approximately 80000 net acres in the entire jackfish area which can support expansion of the original project we requested regulatory approval in late september 2006 to increase the scope and size of the original project we expect to decide in 2007 whether to proceed with this expansion which could eventually add an additional 35000 barrels per day of production 

 

deep basin  — our properties in canada’s deep basin include portions of west central alberta and east central british columbia we hold approximately 646000 net acres in the deep basin the area produces primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs our average working interest in the 

deep basin is 46 we drilled 115 gross wells in the deep basin in 2006 and plan to drill 57 gross wells in the area in 2007 

 

lloydminster  — our lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of jackfish in eastern alberta and western saskatchewan lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means without steam injection we hold 21 million net acres and have a 97 average working interest in our lloydminster properties in 2006 we drilled 397 gross wells in the area and plan to drill 395 gross wells in 2007 

 

peace river arch  — the peace river arch is located in west central alberta we hold approximately 476000 net acres in the area which produces primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs our average working interest in the area is about 69 we drilled 82 gross wells in the peace river arch in 2006 and we expect to drill 62 additional wells here in 2007

title to properties 

 

title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

 

as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations generally including a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

royalty matters 

 

numerous gas producers and related parties including devon have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act the suits allege that the producers and related parties used belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel wright v chevron usa inc et al the “wright case” the suit was originally filed in august 1996 in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas but was consolidated in october 2000 with the other suits for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming on july 10 2003 the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings on february 1 2006 the court entered a scheduling order in which trial is set for november 2007 we believe we have acted reasonably have legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit and have paid royalties in good faith we do not currently believe that we are subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no related liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

 

equatorial guinea investigation 

 

the sec has been conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea and to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea on august 9 2005 we received a subpoena issued by the sec pursuant to a formal order of investigation we have cooperated fully with the sec’s requests for information in this inquiry after responding in 2005 to such requests for information we have not been contacted by the sec in the event that we receive any further inquiries we will work with the sec in connection with its investigation

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

introduction 

 

the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future reference is made to “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” our discussion and analysis will relate to the following subjects 

 

  

overview of business 

 

devon is one of the largest us based independent oil and gas producers and processors of natural gas and natural gas liquids in north america our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable production and a platform for future growth about 90 percent of our production is from north america we also operate in selected international areas including azerbaijan brazil and china our production mix is about 65 percent natural gas and 35 percent oil and natural gas liquids such as propane butane and ethane we are currently producing about 23 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day or about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in north america 

 

in managing our global operations we have an operating strategy that is focused on creating and increasing value per share key elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves growing production and exercising capital discipline we must also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks to achieve longterm success the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors 

 

 29 

  

  

overview of 2006 results and outlook 

 

2006 was one of the best years in devon’s history we achieved key operational successes and continued to execute our strategy to increase value per share as a result we delivered record amounts for earnings per share and operating cash flow and grew proved reserves to a new alltime high key measures of our financial and operating performance for 2006 as well as certain operational developments are summarized below 

 

  

we produced 214 million boe in 2006 representing a 4 decrease compared to 2005 excluding the effects of production lost due to the sale of noncore properties in the first half of 2005 our yearoveryear production remained constant operating costs increased due to inflationary pressure driven by the effects of 

higher commodity prices and due to the weakened us dollar compared to the canadian dollar per unit lease operating expenses increased 17 to 695 per boe 

 

during 2006 we utilized cash on hand cash flow from operations and 18 billion of commercial paper borrowings to fund our capital expenditures repay 862 million in debt and repurchase 253 million of our common stock we ended the year with 13 billion of cash and shortterm investments 

 

from an operational perspective our deepwater gulf of mexico exploration program has reached several important milestones related to the lower tertiary trend to date we have drilled four discovery wells in the lower tertiary — cascade in 2002 st malo in 2003 jack in 2004 and kaskida in the third quarter of 2006 also in the third quarter of 2006 we announced the successful production test of the jack no 2 well in the lower tertiary we currently hold 273 blocks in the lower tertiary and have identified 19 additional exploratory prospects within these blocks to date these achievements support our positive view of the lower tertiary and demonstrate the growth potential of our highimpact exploration strategy on longterm production reserves and value 

 

on june 29 2006 we acquired chief’s oil and gas assets located in the barnett shale area of texas for 22 billion this transaction added 997 million boe of proved reserves and 169000 net acres to our barnett shale assets this acquisition combined with our organic growth continues to extend our leadership position in the barnett shale and provides years of additional drilling inventory 

 

on november 14 2006 we announced our plans to divest our operations in egypt at december 31 2006 egypt had proved reserves of eight million boe subsequently on january 23 2007 we announced our plans to divest our operations in west africa including equatorial guinea cote d’ivoire and other countries in the region at december 31 2006 our west africa operations had proved reserves of 90 million boe or 4 of total proved reserves we anticipate completing the sale of our egyptian assets in the first half of 2007 and our west african assets in the third quarter of 2007 divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in north america and in the deepwater gulf of mexico additionally we will sharpen our focus in north america and concentrate our international operations in brazil and china where we have established competitive advantages 

 

looking to 2007 we intend to use the proceeds from the sales of our operations in egypt and west africa to repay our outstanding commercial paper and resume common stock repurchases in addition our operational accomplishments to date have laid the foundation for continued growth in future years at competitive unit costs that we expect will continue to create additional value for our investors in 2007 we expect to deliver reserve additions of 350 to 370 million boe with related capital expenditures in the range of 53 to 57 billion we expect production related to our continuing operations to increase approximately 10 from 2006 to 2007 which reflects the significant reserve additions in 2005 and 2006 and those expected in 2007 

 

results of operations 

 

revenues 

 

changes in oil gas and ngl production prices and revenues from 2004 to 2006 are shown in the following tables the amounts for all periods presented exclude our egyptian operations unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 33 

 

the average prices shown in the preceding tables include the effect of our oil and gas price hedging activities following is a comparison of our average prices with and without the effect of hedges for each of the last three years 

 

 

 

the following table details the effects of changes in volumes and prices on our oil gas and ngl revenues between 2004 and 2006 

 

 

 

oil revenues 

 

2006 vs 2005 oil revenues decreased 270 million due to a seven million barrel decrease in production production lost from properties divested in 2005 accounted for four million barrels of the decrease a contractual reduction of our share of production from one of our international properties in mid2005 also lowered 2006 volumes these decreases were partially offset by a three million barrel increase in production resulting from reaching payout of certain carried interests in azerbaijan 

 

oil revenues increased 11 billion as a result of a 53 increase in our realized price the expiration of oil hedges at the end of 2005 and a 17 increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price caused the increase in our realized oil price 

 

2005 vs 2004 oil revenues decreased 347 million due to a 12 million barrel decrease in production production lost from the 2005 property divestitures accounted for seven million barrels of the decrease we also suspended certain domestic production in 2005 and 2004 due to the effects of hurricanes katrina rita dennis and ivan the volumes suspended in 2005 were one million barrels more than in 2004 the remainder of the decrease is due to certain international properties in which our ownership interest decreased after we recovered our costs under the applicable production sharing contracts 

 

higher realized prices caused oil revenues to increase 607 million in 2005 our 2005 oil prices rose primarily due to a 37 increase in the average nymex west texas intermediate index price 

 

gas revenues 

 

2006 vs 2005 a 12 bcf decrease in production caused gas revenues to decrease by 86 million production lost from the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of 35 bcf as a result of the previously mentioned hurricanes gas volumes suspended in 2006 were three bcf more than those suspended in 2005 these decreases were partially offset by the june 2006 chief acquisition which contributed 10 bcf of production during the last half of 2006 and additional production from new drilling and development in our us onshore and offshore properties 

 

a 13 decline in average prices caused gas revenues to decrease 766 million in 2006 

 

2005 vs 2004 a 64 bcf decrease in production caused gas revenues to decrease by 337 million production associated with the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of 89 bcf we also suspended certain domestic gas production in 2005 and 2004 due to the previously mentioned hurricanes the volumes suspended in 2005 were 12 bcf more than in 2004 these decreases were partially offset by new drilling and development and increased performance in us onshore and offshore properties 

 

a 32 increase in average gas prices contributed 14 billion of additional revenues in 2005 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses 

 

the following table details the changes in our marketing and midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses between 2004 and 2006 the changes due to prices in the table represent the net effect on both revenues and expenses due to changes in the market prices for natural gas and ngls 

 

 

 

2006 vs 2005 volume increases in our gas pipeline gas sales and ngl marketing activities caused both revenues and expenses to increase in 2006 this additional activity was primarily due to our continued growth in the barnett shale and higher natural gas deliveries from thirdparty producers 

 

2005 vs 2004 volume decreases in 2005 caused both revenues and expenses to decline in 2005 the lower activity was primarily attributable to the sale of certain noncore assets in 2004 and 2005 

 

oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses 

 

the details of the changes in oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses between 2004 and 2006 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 35 

 

2006 vs 2005 lease operating expenses increased 164 million in 2006 largely due to higher commodity prices commodity price increases in 2005 and the first half of 2006 contributed to industrywide inflationary pressures on materials and personnel costs additionally consideration of higher commodity prices contributed to our decision to perform more well workovers and maintenance projects to maintain or improve production volumes commodity price increases also caused operating costs such as ad valorem taxes power and fuel costs to rise 

 

a higher canadiantous dollar exchange rate in 2006 caused a 34 million increase in our costs lease operating expenses also increased 33 million due to the june 2006 chief acquisition and the payouts of our carried interests in azerbaijan in the last half of 2006 the increases in our lease operating expenses were partially offset by a decrease of 82 million related to properties that were sold in 2005 

 

the factors described above were also the primary factors causing lease operating expenses per boe to increase during 2006 although we divested properties in 2005 that had higher perunit operating costs the cost escalation largely related to higher commodity prices and the weaker us dollar had a greater effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures 

 

2005 vs 2004 lease operating expenses increased 65 million in 2005 largely due to higher commodity prices as addressed above commodity price increases led to overall industry inflation additionally a higher canadiantous dollar exchange rate in 2005 caused a 30 million increase in 2005 partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of 144 million in lease operating expenses related to properties that were sold in 2005 

 

the increases described above were also the primary factors causing lease operating expenses per boe to increase although we divested properties that had higher perunit operating costs the cost escalation largely related to higher commodity prices and the weaker us dollar had a greater effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures 

 

the following table details the changes in production taxes between 2004 and 2006 the majority of our production taxes are assessed on our onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the changes due to revenues in the table primarily relate to changes in oil gas and ngl revenues from our us onshore properties 

 

 

 

2006 vs 2005 production taxes increased 29 million due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2006 a new chinese “special petroleum gain” tax was the primary contributor to the higher rate 

 

2005 vs 2004 production taxes increased 30 million due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2005 an increase in russian export tax rates was the primary contributor to the higher rate 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties “dda” 

 

dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents the net capitalized investment plus future development costs in those reserves generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by 

production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

 

the following table details the changes in dda of oil and gas properties between 2004 and 2006 the changes due to volumes in the table represent the effect on dda due to decreases in combined oil gas and ngl production 

 

 

 

2006 vs 2005 oil and gas property related dda increased 370 million in 2006 due to an increase in the dda rate from 886 per boe in 2005 to 1059 per boe in 2006 the largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2006 as well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on proved undeveloped reserves other factors contributing to the rate increase include the june 2006 chief acquisition and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of 2006 drilling activities a reduction in reserve estimates due to the effects of 2006 yearend commodity prices also contributed to the rate increase 

 

2005 vs 2004 oil and gas property related dda increased 99 million in 2005 due to an increase in the dda rate from 841 per boe in 2004 to 886 per boe in 2005 the largest contributor to the rate increase was the effect of inflationary pressure on finding and development costs for reserve discoveries and extensions changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate also caused the rate to increase these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the rate as a result of our 2005 property divestitures 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

 

 

2006 vs 2005 gross ga increased 192 million higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross ga to increase 149 million of this increase 34 million represented stock option expense recognized pursuant to our adoption in 2006 of statement of financial accounting standard no 123r sharebased payment an additional 28 million of the increase related to higher restricted stock compensation in addition changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate caused a 11 million increase in costs 

 

2005 vs 2004 gross ga increased 32 million higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross ga to increase 35 million of this increase 17 million related to higher restricted stock compensation in addition changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate caused a 9 million increase in costs these increases were partially offset by an 8 million decrease in rent expense resulting primarily from the abandonment of certain canadian office space in 2004 

 

the factors discussed above were also the primary factors that caused the 88 million and 15 million increases in capitalized ga in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

interest expense 

 

the following schedule includes the components of interest expense between 2004 and 2006 

 

 

 

interest based on debt outstanding decreased from 2004 to 2006 primarily due to the net effect of debt repayments during 2005 and 2006 this was partially offset by the effect of increased commercial paper borrowings during the last half of 2006 related to the acquisition of the chief properties 

 

during 2005 we redeemed our 400 million 675 notes due march 15 2011 and our zero coupon convertible senior debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates the other interest category in the table above includes 81 million in 2005 related to these early retirements 

 

during 2004 we repaid the balance under our 3 billion term loan credit facility prior to the scheduled repayment date the other interest category in the table above includes 16 million in 2004 related to this early repayment 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

during 2006 and 2005 we reduced the carrying value of certain of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities a detailed description of how full cost ceiling limitations are determined is included in the “critical accounting policies and estimates” section of this report a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

 

 

2006 reductions 

 

we have committed to drill four wells in nigeria the first two wells were unsuccessful after drilling the second unsuccessful well in the first quarter of 2006 we determined that the capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired therefore in the first quarter of 2006 we recognized an 85 million impairment of our investment in nigeria equal to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no tax benefit related to this impairment 

 

during the second quarter of 2006 we drilled two unsuccessful exploratory wells in brazil and determined that the capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired therefore in the second quarter of 2006 we recognized a 16 million impairment of our investment in brazil equal to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of blockrelated costs there was no tax benefit related to this impairment the two wells were unrelated to devon’s polvo development project in brazil 

 

as a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows the carrying value of our russian properties exceeded the full cost ceiling by 10 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006 therefore we recognized a 20 million reduction of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in russia offset by a 10 million deferred income tax benefit 

 

2005 reductions 

 

our interests in angola were acquired through the 2003 ocean energy merger our angolan drilling program discovered no proven reserves after drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that all of the angolan capitalized costs should be impaired 

 

prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 we were capitalizing the costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in brazil pending the determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in brazil we have been successful in our drilling efforts on block bmc8 in brazil and are currently developing the polvo project on this block the ultimate value of the polvo project is expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in brazil which were capitalized however the polvo proved reserves will be recorded over a period of time at the end of 2005 it was expected that a small initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at polvo would be recorded in 2006 based on preliminary estimates developed in the fourth quarter of 2005 the value of this initial partial booking of proved reserves was not sufficient to offset the sum of the related proportionate polvo costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts therefore we determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to the polvo project should be impaired these costs totaled approximately 42 million there was no tax benefit related to this brazilian impairment 

 

change in fair value of derivative financial instruments 

 

the details of the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments between 2004 and 2006 are shown in the table below 

 

 

 

the change in the fair value of the embedded option relates to the debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock these expenses were caused primarily by increases in the price of chevron corporation’s common stock 

 

in 2005 we recognized a 39 million loss on certain oil derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual and projected production under these contracts the lower than expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that affected offshore production in the gulf of mexico 

 

other income net 

 

the following schedule includes the components of other income between 2004 and 2006 

 

 

 

interest and dividend income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to an increase in cash and shortterm investment balances and higher interest rates 

 

during 2005 we sold certain noncore midstream assets for a net gain of 150 million also during 2005 we incurred a 55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end of their original term these hedges related to us and canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005 property divestiture program this loss was partially offset by a 7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction with the early redemption of the 400 million 675 senior notes in 2005 

 

the gains in 2005 and 2004 from changes in foreign exchange rates were primarily related to 400 million of canadian subsidiary debt that was denominated in us dollars the debt was retired in 2005 

 

income taxes 

 

the following table presents our total income tax expense related to continuing operations and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the us statutory income tax rate for each of the past three years the primary factors causing our effective rates to vary from 2004 to 2006 and differ from the us statutory rate are discussed below 

 

 

 

in 2006 2005 and 2004 deferred income taxes were reduced 243 million 14 million and 36 million respectively due to canadian statutory rate reductions that were enacted in each such year 

 

in 2006 deferred income taxes increased 39 million due to the effect of a new incomebased tax enacted by the state of texas that replaces a previous franchise tax the new tax is effective january 1 2007 

 

in 2006 and 2005 income taxes were reduced 12 million and 25 million respectively due to a new us tax deduction for companies with domestic production activities including oil and gas extraction 

 

in 2005 we recognized 28 million of taxes related to our repatriation of 545 million to the us the cash was repatriated due to tax legislation that allowed qualifying companies to repatriate cash from foreign operations at a reduced income tax rate substantially all of the cash repatriated by us in 2005 related to earnings of our canadian subsidiary 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

on november 14 2006 we announced our plans to divest our operations in egypt we anticipate completing the sale of our egyptian operations in the first half of 2007 pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations egypt is considered a discontinued operation at the end of 2006 as a result the egypt financial results for 2006 and all prior periods have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations 

 

following are the components of the results of discontinued operations between 2004 and 2006 

 

 

 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

the following discussion of capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from 2004 to 2006 the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis therefore these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document additional discussion of these items follows the table 

 

 

 

operating cash flow — continuing operations 

 

net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” is our primary source of capital and liquidity changes in operating cash flow are largely due to the same factors that affect our net earnings with the exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as dda property impairments derivative fair value changes and deferred income tax expense as a result our operating cash flow increased in 2006 and 2005 compared to the previous years largely due to increases in net earnings as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

 

sales of property and equipment 

 

in 2005 we generated 22 billion in pretax proceeds from sales of property and equipment these consisted of 20 billion related to the sale of noncore oil and gas properties and 02 billion related to the sale of noncore midstream assets net of related income taxes these proceeds were 18 billion for oil and gas properties and 01 billion for midstream assets 

 

net commercial paper borrowings 

 

on june 29 2006 we acquired chief for 2 billion of cash and the assumption of 02 billion of liabilities we funded a portion of the purchase price with 14 billion of borrowings issued under our commercial paper program as a result of the chief acquisition and success in other onshore us locations we accelerated certain oil and gas development activities into the last half of 2006 we borrowed an additional 04 billion of commercial paper to fund this accelerated development 

 

capital expenditures 

 

the increases in operating cash flow have enabled us to invest larger amounts in capital projects as a result excluding the acquisition of the chief properties our capital expenditures increased 38 in 2006 the majority of this increase related to our expenditures for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 50 billion in 2006 excluding the chief acquisition inflationary pressure driven by higher commodity prices and increased drilling activities in the barnett shale gulf of mexico carthage and groesbeck areas of the us contributed to the increase in addition the payouts of our carried interests in azerbaijan in the last half of 2006 and the weaker us dollar impact on our canadian operations also contributed to the increase 

 

capital expenditures in 2005 increased 32 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in our expenditures for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 39 billion in 2005 increased drilling activities in the barnett shale the approximately 200 million acquisition of iron river acreage in canada and the 74 million purchase of the serpentina fpso in offshore equatorial guinea were large contributors to the increase inflationary pressure driven by higher commodity prices and the weaker us dollar also caused our expenditures to increase from 2004 to 2005 

 

debt repayments 

 

our net debt retirements were 09 billion 13 billion and 10 billion in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively these amounts consisted of payments at the scheduled maturity dates with the exception of the following payments the 2006 amount includes 02 billion related to the repayment of debt acquired in the chief acquisition the 2005 amount includes 08 billion related to the retirement of zero coupon convertible debentures due in 2020 and 675 notes due in 2011 the 2004 amount includes 635 million for the payment of the outstanding balance under a 3 billion term loan credit facility due in 2006 

 

repurchases of common stock 

 

in august 2005 we completed a share repurchase program that began in october 2004 under this program we repurchased 496 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 23 billion or 4669 per share in august 2005 we announced another program to repurchase up to an additional 50 million shares of our common stock during 2005 and 2006 we repurchased 65 million shares for 387 million or 5980 per share under this program 

 

dividends 

 

our common stock dividends were 199 million 136 million and 97 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we also paid 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2006 2005 and 2004 the 2006 and 2005 increases in common stock dividends were primarily related to a 50 increase in the dividend rate in the first quarter of both 2006 and 2005 partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares due to share repurchases 

 

changes in shortterm investments 

 

to maximize our income on available cash balances we invest in highly liquid shortterm investments the purchase and sale of these shortterm investments will cause cash and cash equivalents to decrease and 

increase respectively shortterm investment balances decreased 106 million and 287 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively and increased 626 million in 2004 

 

liquidity 

 

historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain a revolving line of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and longterm debt during 2007 another major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our operations in egypt and west africa we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund future capital expenditures debt repayments common stock repurchases and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

 

operating cash flow 

 

our operating cash flow has increased nearly 25 since 2004 reaching a total of 59 billion in 2006 we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls produced prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

 

we periodically believe it appropriate to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices we have used a variety of avenues to achieve this partial risk mitigation we have utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of our production we have also utilized various price swap contracts and fixedprice physical delivery contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production based on contracts currently in place approximately 5 of our estimated 2007 natural gas production 3 of our total boe production is subject to either price collars swaps or fixedprice contracts 

 

commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses significant commodity price increases as experienced in recent years can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities as a result the demand and cost for people services equipment and materials may also increase causing a negative impact on our cash flow 

 

credit lines 

 

another source of liquidity is our 25 billion fiveyear syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the senior credit facility includes a fiveyear revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2006 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility the available capacity under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2006 net of 18 billion of outstanding commercial paper and 284 million of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 408 million 

 

the senior credit facility matures on april 7 2011 and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 7 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders we are working to obtain lender approval to extend the current maturity date of april 7 2011 to april 7 2012 if successful this maturity date extension will be effective april 7 2007 provided we have not experienced a “material adverse effect” as defined in the senior credit facility agreement at that date 

 

the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in our 

consolidated financial statements as defined in the agreement total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2006 our debt to capitalization ratio as calculated pursuant to this covenant was 273 

 

our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our senior credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

 

we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 2 billion also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing the interest rate is based on a standard index such as the federal funds rate libor or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market as of december 31 2006 we had 18 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 537 

 

debt ratings 

 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a positive outlook by standard  poor’s baa2 with a positive outlook by moody’s and bbb with a positive outlook by fitch 

 

there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs for the senior credit facility from libor plus 45 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 65 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future as of december 31 2006 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in february 2007 we provided guidance for our 2007 capital expenditures which are expected to range from 57 billion to 62 billion this represents the largest planned use of our 2007 operating cash flow with the high end of the range being 11 higher than our 2006 capital expenditures excluding the chief acquisition to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2007 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2007 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2007 we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2007 capital expenditures 

 

common stock repurchase program 

 

in august 2005 we announced a program to repurchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock we had repurchased 65 million shares under this program through the middle of 2006 when the program was suspended as a result of the chief acquisition in conjunction with the sales of our egyptian and west african operations we expect to resume this repurchase program in late 2007 by using a portion of the sales proceeds to repurchase common stock although this program expires at the end of 2007 it could be extended if necessary 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 is provided in the following table

pension funding and estimates 

 

funded status as compared to the “projected benefit obligation” our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 178 million and 133 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2006 changes to our underfunded status is included in note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 178 million underfunded status at the end of 2006 156 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2006 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 59 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

as compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation” our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by 59 million at december 31 2006 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels our current intentions are to provide sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated benefit obligation remains fully funded the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets required contributions also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period particularly the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2007 we anticipate the accumulated benefit obligation will remain fully funded without contributing to our defined benefit plans therefore we don’t expect to contribute to the plans during 2007 

 

pension estimate assumptions our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 31 million 26 million and 26 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 43 million in 2007 

 

the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

 

we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 840 at both december 31 2006 and 2005 we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by 

evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets the target investment allocation for our plan assets is 50 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 840 to 740 would increase the expected 2007 pension expense by 6 million 

 

we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 572 at both december 31 2006 and 2005 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 572 to 547 would increase our pension liability at december 31 2006 by 25 million and increase estimated 2007 pension expense by 3 million 

 

at december 31 2006 we had actuarial losses of 214 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages we estimate that approximately 15 million and 13 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2007 and 2008 respectively the 15 million estimated to be recognized in 2007 is a component of the total estimated 2007 pension expense of 43 million referred to earlier in this section 

 

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

 

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act was signed into law beginning in 2008 this act will cause extensive changes in the determination of both the minimum required contribution and the maximum tax deductible limit because the new required contribution will approximate our current policy of fully funding the accumulated benefit obligation the changes are not expected to have a significant impact on future cash flows 

 

beginning with our december 31 2006 balance sheet statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r requires us to recognize on our consolidated balance sheet the funded status of our defined benefit plans the funded status is measured as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as a result we recognized as liabilities the actuarial losses and other costs that were previously unrecognized under prior accounting rules and the net effect was also recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity on december 31 2006 this reduction was 140 million or less than 1 of our stockholders’ equity 

 

contingencies and legal matters 

 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

 

the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

full cost ceiling calculations 

 

policy description 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 

 

if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 1 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

 

while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used 

and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs rather they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place this adjustment requires little judgment as the endofperiod price is adjusted using the contract prices for our cash flow hedges we had no such hedges outstanding at december 31 2006 

 

because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile on any particular day at the end of a quarter prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

derivative financial instruments 

 

policy description 

 

the majority of our historical derivative instruments have consisted of commodity financial instruments used to manage our cash flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility we have also entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility the interest rate swaps mitigate either the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on interest expense for variablerate debt instruments or the fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixedrate debt we also have an embedded option derivative related to the fair value of our debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock 

 

all derivatives are recognized at their current fair value on our balance sheet changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met if such criteria are met for cash flow hedges the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity until the hedged transaction occurs the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations if hedge accounting criteria are met for fair value hedges the change in the fair value is recorded in the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item 

 

a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of an acquisition or business combination which includes derivative contracts additionally we must document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the instrument we must also assess both at the instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the hedged item 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

the estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments require substantial judgment for these instruments we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter in addition we estimate the option value of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional price differentials and interest rates fair values of our other derivative instruments require less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers 

 

quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal impact on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations as long as the derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can have a significant impact on our results of operations but generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources settlements of derivative instruments regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk’’ 

 

business combinations 

 

policy description 

 

we have grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 

 

under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

 

however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies endofperiod price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

 

we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

 

we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net 

revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

 

generally in our business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that we assume in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

 

except for the 2002 mitchell merger our mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

 

the mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that we also acquired from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

 

in addition to the valuation methods described above we perform other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

 

in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination we compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently we compare these comparable transaction multiples to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

 

in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

 

while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas 

prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it is a noncash charge but it would adversely affect results of operations as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — capital resources uses and liquidity” in calculating our debttocapitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

 

our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years our annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

 

valuation of goodwill 

 

policy description 

 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment 

 

judgments and assumptions 

 

generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

 

due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

 

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 

 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 interpretation no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and we will adopt it in the first quarter of 2007 we do not expect the adoption of interpretation no 48 to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements statement no 157 provides a common definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements however this statement does not require any new fair value measurements statement no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the effect if any the adoption of statement no 157 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r statement no 158 requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the balance sheet we adopted this recognition requirement 

as of december 31 2006 the effects of this adoption are summarized in note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements statement no 158 also requires the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend the statement provides two alternatives to transition to a fiscal yearend measurement date this measurement requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 we have not yet adopted this measurement requirement but we do not expect such adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or compliance with debt covenants 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 statement no 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions unrealized gains and losses on any items for which we elect the fair value measurement option would be reported in earnings statement no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 however early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning on or before november 15 2007 provided we also elect to apply the provisions of statement no 157 fair value measurements  at the same time we are currently assessing the effect if any the adoption of statement no 159 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures 

 

2007 estimates 

 

the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on our examination of historical operating trends the information which was used to prepare the december 31 2006 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties these forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil natural gas and ngls during 2007 will be substantially similar to those of 2006 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2007 exchange rate of 089 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

 

on november 14 2006 we announced our intent to divest our egyptian oil and gas assets and terminate our operations in egypt we expect to complete this asset sale during the first half of 2007 subsequently on january 23 2007 we announced our intent to divest our west african oil and gas assets and terminate our operations in west africa we expect to complete this asset sale by the end of the third quarter in 2007 all egyptian and west african related revenues expenses and capital will be reported as discontinued operations in our 2007 financial statements accordingly all forwardlooking estimates in the following discussion exclude amounts related to our operations in egypt and west africa unless otherwise noted the assets held for sale represented less than five percent of our 2006 production and december 31 2006 proved reserves 

 

oil gas and ngl production 

 

set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2007 we estimate on a combined basis that our 2007 oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 219 to 221 mmboe of this total approximately 92 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2006 the following estimates for oil gas and ngl production are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total production 

 

oil production 

 

oil production in 2007 is expected to total approximately 55 mmbbls of this total approximately 99 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2006 the expected production by area is as follows 

 

 

 

oil prices 

 

we have not fixed the price we will receive on any of our 2007 oil production our 2007 average prices for each of our areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma 

 

 

 

gas production 

 

gas production in 2007 is expected to total approximately 841 bcf of this total approximately 88 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2006 the expected production by area is as follows 

 

 

 

gas prices 

 

our 2007 average prices for each of our areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is determined to be the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

 

based on contracts currently in place we will have approximately 116 mmcf per day of gas production in 2007 that is subject to either fixedprice contracts swaps floors or collars these amounts represent approximately 5 of our estimated gas production for 2007 therefore these various pricing arrangements are not expected to have a material impact on the ranges of estimated gas price realizations set forth in the following table 

 

 

ngl production 

 

we expect our 2007 production of ngls to total approximately 25 mmbbls of this total approximately 95 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2006 the expected production by area is as follows 

 

 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 

 

marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of natural gas and ngls provisions of the contract agreements and the amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels 

 

these factors coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl prices increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that marketing and midstream revenues will be between 170 billion and 210 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 131 billion and 167 billion 

 

production and operating expenses 

 

our production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties the amount of repair and workover activity required and changes in production tax rates oil natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects given these uncertainties we estimate that 2007 lease operating expenses including transportation costs will be between 170 billion and 177 billion additionally we estimate our production taxes for 2007 to be between 36 and 41 of consolidated oil natural gas and ngl revenues 

 

depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” 

 

the 2007 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2007 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts and the revisions to our yearend 2006 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2007 

 

given these uncertainties we expect our oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 1100 per boe and 1150 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2007 is expected to be between 242 billion and 253 billion 

 

additionally we expect our depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets to total between 210 million and 220 million 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation 

 

accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2007 is expected to be between 45 million and 55 million 

 

general and administrative expenses “ga” 

 

our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

 

given these limitations ga in 2007 is expected to be between 460 million and 480 million this estimate includes approximately 60 million of noncash sharebased compensation net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

 

reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties 

 

we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates” reductions to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our quarterly reporting periods due to the uncertain nature of future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices we are not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in 2007 

 

interest expense 

 

future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2007 from sales of oil natural gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense other factors which affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures and proceeds from the sale of our assets in egypt and west africa are generally within our control 

 

based on the information related to interest expense set forth below we expect our 2007 interest expense to be between 400 million and 410 million this estimate assumes no material changes in prevailing interest rates this estimate also assumes no material changes in our expected level of indebtedness except for an assumption that our commercial paper will be repaid at the end of the second quarter of 2007 

 

the interest expense in 2007 related to our fixedrate debt including net accretion of related discounts will be approximately 410 million this fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but not all of our longterm debt 

 

our floating rate debt is comprised of variablerate commercial paper and one debt instrument which has been converted to floating rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap our floating rate debt is summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 57 

 

based on estimates of future libor rates as of december 31 2006 interest expense on floating rate debt including net amortization of premiums is expected to total between 80 million and 90 million in 2007 

 

our interest expense totals include payments of facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding we expect between 5 million and 15 million of such items to be included in our 2007 interest expense also we expect to capitalize between 95 million and 105 million of interest during 2007 

 

effects of changes in foreign currency rates 

 

foreign currency gains or losses are not expected to be material in 2007 

 

other income 

 

we estimate that our other income in 2007 will be between 65 million and 85 million 

 

historically we maintained a comprehensive insurance program that included coverage for physical damage to our offshore facilities caused by hurricanes our historical insurance program also included substantial business interruption coverage which we are utilizing to recover costs associated with the suspended production related to hurricanes that struck the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of 2005 

 

based on current estimates of physical damage and the anticipated length of time we will have production suspended we expect our policy recoveries will exceed repair costs and deductible amounts this expectation is based upon several variables including the 467 million received in the third quarter of 2006 as a full settlement of the amount due from our primary insurers as of december 31 2006 154 million of these proceeds had been utilized as reimbursement of past repair costs and deductible amounts the remaining proceeds of 313 million will be utilized as reimbursement of our anticipated future repair costs we have not yet received any settlements related to claims filed with our secondary insurers 

 

should our total policy recoveries including the partial settlements already received from our primary insurers exceed all repair costs and deductible amounts such excess will be recognized as other income in the statement of operations in the period in which such determination can be made based on the most recent estimates of our costs for repairs we believe that some amount will ultimately be recorded as other income however the timing and amount that would be recorded as other income are uncertain therefore the 2007 estimate for other income above does not include any amount related to hurricane proceeds 

 

income taxes 

 

our financial income tax rate in 2007 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2007 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2007 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced 

 

given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect that our consolidated financial income tax rate in 2007 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 15 and 25 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 5 and 15 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil natural gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2007 financial income tax rates 

 

discontinued operations 

 

as previously discussed we intend to divest our egyptian and west african operations in 2007 we expect to complete the sale of egypt during the first half of 2007 and the sale of west africa during the third quarter of 2007 the following table shows the estimates for 2007 oil gas and ngl production as well as the 

anticipated production and operating expenses associated with these discontinued operations for 2007 these estimates assume the sales of egypt and west africa will occur at the end of the second quarter of 2007 pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations the egyptian assets will not be subject to dda during 2007 and the west african assets will only be subject to dda for the first month of 2007 

 

 

 

year 2007 potential capital resources uses and liquidity 

 

capital expenditures 

 

though we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not “budget” nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions 

 

our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for our future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2007 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

 

given the limitations discussed above the following table shows expected drilling development and facilities expenditures by geographic area production capital related to proved reserves relates to reserves classified as proved as of yearend 2006 other production capital includes drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

 

 

 

in addition to the above expenditures for drilling development and facilities we expect to spend between 330 million to 370 million on our marketing and midstream assets which include our oil pipelines gas processing plants co 2 removal facilities and gas transport pipelines we also expect to capitalize between 245 million and 255 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 95 million and 105 million of interest we also expect to pay between 40 million and 50 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 135 million and 145 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets 

 

other cash uses 

 

our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 01125 per share quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2006 dividends are expected to approximate 200 million also we have 150 million of 649 cumulative preferred stock upon which we will pay 10 million of dividends in 2007 

 

capital resources and liquidity 

 

our estimated 2007 cash uses including our drilling and development activities retirement of debt and repurchase of common stock are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of our assets in egypt and west africa any remaining cash uses could be funded by increasing our borrowings under our commercial paper program or with borrowings from the available capacity under our credit facility which was 408 million at december 31 2006 the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2007 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however we expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2007 

 

if significant other acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year we could utilize our existing credit facility andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

 

commodity price risk 

 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” 

 

currently we are largely accepting the volatility risk that oil natural gas and ngl prices present none of our future oil production is subject to price swaps or collars with regard to our future natural gas production based on contracts currently in place we will have approximately 116 mmcf per day of gas production in 2007 that is subject to either fixedprice contracts swaps floors or collars this amount represents approximately 5 of our estimated 2007 gas production 3 of our total boe production for the years 2008 through 2011 we have fixedprice physical delivery contracts covering canadian natural gas production ranging from seven bcf to 14 bcf per year these contracts are not expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices from 2007 through 2011 

 

interest rate risk 

 

at december 31 2006 we had debt outstanding of 78 billion of this amount 56 billion or 72 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 73 additionally we had 18 billion of outstanding commercial paper 

bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 537 at december 31 2006 the remaining debt consists of 400 million 4375 senior notes due in october of 2007 through the use of an interest rate swap this fixedrate debt has been converted to floatingrate debt bearing interest equal to libor plus 40 basis points 

 

we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of any outstanding interest rate swap instruments at december 31 2006 a 10 increase in the underlying interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our interest rate swap by 2 million 

 

the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the shortterm maturity of such instruments 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2006 balance sheet

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to devon including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors 

 

based on their evaluation devon’s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that devon’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 were effective as of december 31 2006 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by devon in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms 

 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

devon’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for devon as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 under the supervision and with the participation of devon’s management including our principal executive and principal financial officers devon conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the “coso framework” based on this evaluation under the coso framework which was completed on february 12 2007 management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 

 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of devon’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm who audited devon’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 as stated in their report which is included herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there was no change in devon’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect devon’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the board of directors and stockholders 

devon energy corporation 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that devon energy corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso devon energy corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that devon energy corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso also in our opinion devon energy corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of devon energy corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 and our report dated february 26 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements our report refers to a change in the method of accounting for sharebased payments and a change in the balance sheet recognition of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans

 item 1 business tableend general 

  devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas we own oil and gas properties principally in the united states and canada and to a lesser degree various regions located outside north america including azerbaijan brazil china egypt russia and west africa in addition to our oil and gas operations we have marketing and midstream operations these include the marketing of natural gas crude oil and ngls and the construction and operation of pipelines storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of our significant properties and associated 2005 developments can be found under “item 2 properties” 

  through our predecessors we began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 our common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in october 2004 we transferred our common stock listing to the new york stock exchange our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

availability of reports

strategy 

  we have a twopronged operating strategy first we invest the vast majority of our capital budget in lowrisk exploitation and development projects on our extensive north american property base which provides reliable and repeatable production and reserves additions to supplement that strategy we annually invest a measured amount of capital in highimpact longcycle time projects to replenish our development inventory for the future the philosophy that underlies the execution of this strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by 

 financial information about segments and geographical areas 

  notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on our segments and geographical areas 

development of business 

  during 1988 we expanded our capital base with our first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years this expansion is attributable to both a focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling program total proved reserves increased 

5 from 8 mmboe at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests to 2112 mmboe at yearend 2005 

  during the same time period we have grown proved reserves from 066 boe per diluted share at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 449 boe per diluted share at yearend 2005 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 12 we also increased production from 009 boe per diluted share in 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 048 boe per diluted share in 2005 a compound annual growth rate of 10 this per share growth is a direct result of successful execution of our strategic plan and other key transactions and events a number of these recent key transactions and events as well as a summary of our recent drilling activities are presented below and in the next section of this report entitled “drilling activities” 

 drilling activities 

  the following tables set forth the results of our drilling activity for the past five years 

total properties 

 6 united states properties 

 canadian properties 

 international properties 

  

   as of december 31 2005 we were participating in the drilling of 149 gross 9937 net wells in the us 33 gross 1655 net wells in canada and 35 gross 858 net wells internationally of these wells through february 1 2006 57 gross 3413 net wells in the us 11 gross 890 net wells in canada and 2 gross 030 net wells internationally had been completed as productive an additional 1 gross 006 net well in the us was a dry hole the remaining wells were still in progress 

customers 

  we sell our gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

7   the principal customers for our crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

  no purchaser accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2005 

oil and natural gas marketing 

  the spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements fixedprice contracts or firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

   our oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties 

   our gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2006 approximately 79 of our natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 19 were committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices our remaining gas production was sold under longterm fixed price contracts 

marketing and midstream activities 

  the primary objective of our marketing and midstream group is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering processing and marketing oil and gas production in a timely and efficient manner our most significant marketing and midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only our gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area 

  our marketing and midstream revenue sources are primarily generated by 

   our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from 

 8 competition 

  see “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

  generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

government regulation 

  the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration production and marketing and midstream activities these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations however we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 

  the following are significant areas of government control and regulation in the united states canada and international locations in which we operate 

   exploration and production our united states operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production our operations are also subject to various conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in this regard some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally limit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

  certain oil and gas leases including our offshore gulf of mexico leases most of our leases in the san juan basin and many of our leases in southeast new mexico montana and wyoming are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the minerals management service of the department of the interior “mms” such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and 

9 regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

  environmental and occupational regulations various federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect our exploration development processing and production operations and related costs we are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health we consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business we maintain our own internal environmental health and safety department this department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for devon the program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of our compliance procedures we have been able to plan for and comply with new environmental and safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies 

  we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however 100 coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of violation of any federal state or local law we are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters were immaterial but we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  we are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state statutes in response to claims associated with these activities we recognize liabilities when reasonable estimates are possible such liabilities are primarily for estimated costs associated with remediation we have not used discounting in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements we adjust the liabilities when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information 

  certain of our subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties “prps” under cercla or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties as of december 31 2005 our consolidated balance sheet included 4 million of noncurrent accrued liabilities reflected in “other liabilities” related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities we do not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the existing liabilities recognized for such environmental remediation activities with respect to the sites in which our subsidiaries are prps our conclusion is based in large part on our i participation in consent decrees with both other prps and the environmental protection agency which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the prps ii participation in groups as a de minimis prp and iii the availability of other defenses to liability as a result our monetary exposure is not expected to be material 

  canadian regulations 

  exploration and production our canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental regulations such regulations include requiring licenses for the drilling of wells regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce wells surface usage and the restoration of land 

10 upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from wells our canadian operations are also subject to various conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of spacing units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the ability to produce oil and gas in canada the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

  royalties and incentives each province and the federal government of canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure royalties production rates and taxes environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the governments of canada alberta british columbia and saskatchewan have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing our cash flow 

  pricing and marketing the price of oil natural gas and ngls sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers an order from the national energy board “neb” is required for oil exports from canada any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year in the case of light crude and two years in the case of heavy crude requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb the issue of such a license requires the approval of the government of canada natural gas exported from canada is also subject to similar regulation by the neb natural gas exports for a term of less than two years or for a term of two to twenty years in quantities of not more than 20000 mcf per day must be made pursuant to an neb order any natural gas exports to be made pursuant to a contract of larger duration to a maximum of 25 years or in larger quantities require an exporter to obtain a license from the neb which requires the approval of the government of canada exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers provided that the export contracts meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability transportation arrangements and market considerations 

  environmental regulation the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local provincial and federal legislation environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations in addition legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties we are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters were immaterial but we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters 

  the north american free trade agreement the north american free trade agreement “nafta” grants canada the freedom to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed in making this determination canada must ensure that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price or iii disrupt normal channels of supply all parties to nafta are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 

11   kyoto protocol the kyoto protocol calls for canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012 the protocol is expected to affect the operation of all industries in canada including the oil and gas industry as details of the implementation of emissions reduction legislation related to this protocol have yet to be finalized the effect on our operations cannot be determined at this time 

  investment canada act the investment canada act requires government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

   exploration and production our oil and gas concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate among other matters seismic drilling and production operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments taxes and minimum investments to the government 

  regulations include requiring permits for acquiring seismic data drilling wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production our operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 

  production sharing contracts many of our international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years many pscs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages pscs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions for example at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue 

  environmental regulations various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect our exploration development processing and production operations and related costs in general this consists of preparing environmental impact assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans waste management plans environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans in some countries the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations additionally the kyoto protocol will have requirements similar to those for canada for the oil and gas industry in azerbaijan brazil china egypt equatorial guinea nigeria and russia as details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced the effect on our international operations if any cannot be determined at this time 

employees 

  as of december 31 2005 our staff consisted of 4075 fulltime employees we believe we have good labor relations with our employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business activities and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a variety of risks although we have a diversified asset base a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital expenditure and investment programs and to pay dividends if any of the following risk factors should occur our profitability financial condition andor liquidity could be materially impacted as a result holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in devon 

oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile 

  our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for oil natural gas and ngls a significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves revenues and operating cash flows such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future growth historically prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to 

 estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves are uncertain 

  the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir particularly for new discoveries because of the high degree of judgment involved different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data in addition the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue as well as our financial condition and profitability additional discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is described in “item 2 properties — proved reserves and estimated future net revenue” 

discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 

  the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors therefore our estimated proved reserves and future oil gas and ngl production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional producing zones in existing wells secondary recovery reserves or 

13 tertiary recovery reserves or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves consequently our future oil gas and ngl production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 

future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 

  substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells such activities are subject to numerous risks including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs the costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain in addition oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to 

   a significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property in addition drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition while both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons we are currently performing exploratory drilling activities in certain international countries we have been granted drilling concessions in these countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur significant capital expenditures even if future drilling activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves we will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital expenditures 

industry competition for leases materials people and capital can be significant 

  strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore develop and operate properties competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil gas and ngls higher recent commodity prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours and they have also established strategic longterm positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry as a consequence we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights in addition many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 

international operations have uncertain political economic and other risks 

  we have international operations in angola azerbaijan brazil china cote d’ivoire egypt equatorial guinea gabon ghana indonesia nigeria and the russian republic of tatarstan as a result 

14 we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties that are less prevalent for our operations in north america such factors include but are not limited to 

   foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country our interests could decrease in value or be lost even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment in an extreme case such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreignowned assets this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 

  the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly oil and the possibility that infrastructure facilities including pipelines production facilities processing plants and refineries could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 

government laws and regulations can change 

  our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in the united states canada and the other international countries in which we operate in addition we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states provinces and local governments pursuant to such legislation numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply changes in such legislation have affected and at times in the future could affect our future operations political developments can restrict production levels enact price controls change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations such changes could 

15 significantly impact our profitability while such legislation can change at any time in the future those laws and regulations outside north america to which we are subject generally include greater risk of unforeseen change 

environmental matters and costs can be significant 

  as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal provincial state local and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment these laws and regulations may among other things impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from our operations in affected areas 

insurance does not cover all risks 

  exploration development production and processing of oil natural gas and ngls can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences such as hurricanes blowouts cratering fires and loss of well control these occurrences can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities injury to persons loss of life or damage to property or the environment we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent however insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  not applicable 




 item 2 properties tableend   substantially all of our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in our core operating areas these interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

  we also have certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems our most significant midstream assets are our assets serving the barnett shale development in north texas these assets include approximately 2600 miles of pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl fractionator 

proved reserves and estimated future net revenue 

  the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” as a result we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to our reserve evaluation group the “group” the policies also require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators “qres” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards a list of qres is kept by the senior advisor — corporate reserves all qres are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

  the group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and certification and includes the manager — ep budgets and reserves and the senior advisor — corporate reserves the group reports independently of any of our operating divisions the vice president — planning and evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the group and reports to the president of devon no portion of the group’s compensation is dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

  throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major changes additions and 

16 revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants as discussed below 

  in addition to internal audits we engage three independent petroleum consulting firms to perform both external reserves preparation and audits ryder scott company lp prepared the reserves estimates for all offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 98 of the international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the reserves estimates for 87 of the domestic onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants prepared estimates covering 46 of our canadian reserves and audited an additional 26 of our canadian reserves 

  set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 

   “prepared” reserves are those estimates of quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

  we follow what we believe to be a rational approach not only to recording oil and gas reserves but also to subjecting these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants in 2004 and 2003 63 of our companywide reserves were prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm in 2005 85 of our companywide reserves were prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm we expect the 2005 percent to be indicative of the coverage provided by independent reviews in 2006 this approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates this is evidenced by the fact that in the past five years our annual performance related revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 1 of the previous year’s estimate 

  in addition to internal and external reviews three independent members of our board of directors have been assigned to a reserves committee the reserves committee meets at lease twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants the reserves committee assists the board of directors with the oversight of the following 

 17   the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and the related estimated pretax future net revenues pretax 10 present value and aftertax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december 31 2005 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein

   as presented in the previous table we had 1599 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2005 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding our proved developed reserves at december 31 2005 

   no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except i in filings 

19 with the sec and ii in filings with the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed with the sec correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate 

  the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2005 there can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

production revenue and price history 

  certain information concerning oil natural gas and ngl production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other third party interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2005 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 operation of properties 

  the dayto day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

  we are the operator of 18784 of our wells as operator we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting our financial data we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

   our north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions canadian properties are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia properties outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan china egypt and areas in west africa including equatorial guinea gabon and cote d’ivoire additionally we have exploratory interests but no current producing assets in other international countries including angola brazil ghana and nigeria maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed us to improve operating and capital efficiency 

  the following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which our properties are located as of december 31 2005 

  

 21  

 

   our permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas these assets include conventional oil and gas properties producing from a wide variety of geologic formations and depths our leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses 108000 net acres of developed lands and 221000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals historically we have been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation 

  in the west texas portion of the permian basin we maintain a base of oil production with longlife reserves many of these reserves are from both operated and nonoperated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit the willard unit the reeves unit the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit these oilproducing units often exhibit low decline rates we also own a significant acreage position in west texas with more than 200000 net acres of developed lands and more than 273000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december 31 2005 

   the midcontinent region includes portions of texas oklahoma and kansas these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas our midcontinent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties however the barnett shale in north texas acquired in 2002 is a nonconventional gas resource the midcontinent region represented 24 of our proved reserves at december 31 2005 approximately 80 of our proved reserves in the midcontinent area are in the barnett shale 

  the barnett shale our largest producing field is known as a tight gas formation this means that in its natural state the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas however the application of available technology has made the barnett shale a lowrisk and highly profitable natural gas operation cumulative natural gas production from our wells in the barnett shale surpassed one trillion cubic feet during 2005 we hold 552000 net acres and over 2100 producing wells in the barnett shale our average working interest is more than 80 

  we have been successful in extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells to increase production rates we are also applying horizontal drilling closer well spacing and reservoir optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the barnett shale 

  our marketing and midstream operations gather and process our barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties the barnett shale gathering system consists of approximately 2600 miles of pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl fractionator 

  in 2006 we plan to drill a total of 325 new barnett shale wells including 266 horizontal and 59 vertical wells we began an infill drilling program on our core area acreage in 2005 and plan to drill 50 to 60 horizontal infill wells in 2006 current net production from the barnett shale is approximately 95 mboe per day 

   our operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming montana utah and northern new mexico these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed natural gas projects approximately 17 of our proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed natural gas we began producing coalbed natural gas in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid1980s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in 1998 as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 1360 producing coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin net coalbed natural gas production from the basin was approximately 11 mboe per day as of december 31 2005 we plan to drill about 250 new wells in the powder river basin in 2006 

  the washakie field in wyoming is another significant natural gas producing area in our rocky mountain region in 2005 we drilled 88 wells in the washakie field including 53 wells we operate in 2006 we plan to drill up to 70 wells and participate in another 35 outsideoperated wells we have interests in over 200000 gross acres and an inventory of more than 300 drilling locations our current net production from washakie is approximately 16 mboe per day 

   our gulf coast onshore properties are located in south and east texas louisiana and mississippi most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations 

  our operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards wilcox and friovicksburg formations we drilled three exploratory discoveries on our gulf coast acreage in 2005 drilling plans in 2006 include 34 new wells and 64 recompletions 

  east texas is an important conventional gas producing region and carthage and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas of this region wells produce from the cotton valley sands the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates we have interests in over 2300 producing wells in east texas and plans to drill 139 wells in carthage and over 30 wells in groesbeck in 2006 

  we have an active exploration program under way in the bossier trend in north louisiana we hold about 200000 net acres in seven bossier prospect areas we drilled exploratory test wells on the vixen and north vixen prospects in 2005 plans for 2006 include test wells on three additional bossier prospects 

   the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for 13 of our 2005 production we operate over 300 platforms and caissons in the gulf of mexico gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth the shallow water shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less we operate in both the shelf and deepwater areas 

  in 2005 we continued development of the deepwater magnolia field garden banks 783 at december 31 2005 six magnolia wells were producing approximately 10 mboe per day to our interest the final two magnolia producing wells will be completed in 2006 also in 2006 we will complete two producing gas wells in the deepwater merganser field atwater valley 37 merganser will produce into the independence hub which is expected to be completed in early 2007 we expect our net share of production from merganser to be approximately eight mboe per day 

  in addition to our producing properties we have a significant inventory of exploration prospects in the gulf of mexico the current prospect inventory includes 15 shelf prospects 18 deepwater prospects in the lower tertiary trend and 17 deepwater miocene prospects 

  on the shallowwater shelf the industry is exploring for oil and gas reserves at depths in excess of 15000 feet we drilled a “deep shelf” discovery well on the big bend prospect mustang island a110 in 2005 we are the operator of big bend with a 50 working interest 

23   in the deepwater gulf of mexico almost all historical production of oil and gas has been from miocene aged reservoirs we currently produce approximately 50 mboe per day from the deepwater gulf during 2006 we expect to drill exploratory wells on three miocene prospects 

  in recent years the industry has begun to explore for oil below the miocene in older formations that are collectively referred to as the lower tertiary to date we have participated in three lower tertiary discoveries 

  cascade walker ridge 206 was our first discovery in the lower tertiary trend we drilled successful appraisal wells on the prospect in 2005 also in 2005 we drilled a successful appraisal of the jack lower tertiary discovery walker ridge 759 an extended production test of the jack appraisal well is planned for 2006 using information obtained from a successful production test we and our partners will be able to determine a development plan for the jack discovery we hold 25 working interests in jack and cascade our third lower tertiary discovery is st malo walker ridge 678 additional appraisal drilling on st malo is pending partner approval and rig availability we have a 225 working interest in the st malo discovery 

   we are among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operate in most of the producing basins in western canada as of december 31 2005 30 of our proved reserves were in canada 

  many of the canadian basins where we operate are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen consequently the winter season from december through march is the most active drilling period we expect to drill about 380 wells in the 20052006 winter program in canada 

  we hold approximately 410000 net undeveloped acres in the deep basin in westcentral alberta where we drilled 179 wells in 2005 and have another active drilling program planned for 2006 the profitability of our operations in the deep basin is enhanced by our ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids producing up to 50 barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas 

  other important oil and gas exploration and development areas in canada include the peace river arch northeast british columbia central alberta and the lloydminster region of alberta and saskatchewan at lloydminster cold flow heavy oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1000 to 2000 feet in 2005 we acquired 165000 net acres in the iron river area within the greater lloydminster region we expect to drill 800 wells at iron river over the next four years 

  the oil sands of eastern alberta are a vast north american hydrocarbon resource we hold over 75000 net acres of oil sands leases in alberta in 2004 we received final regulatory approval to proceed with development of our jackfish thermal oil sands project in which we have a 100 working interest the project is expected to produce 35 mbbls per day of heavy oil when fully operational in 2008 we expect to drill 34 horizontal wells at jackfish in 2006 along with the construction of the access dual pipeline access will transport diluent and blended crude oil between jackfish and edmonton 

   beyond our core properties in the united states and canada we also look outside north america for longerterm reserve and production growth at december 31 2005 these international areas accounted for 12 of our worldwide proved reserves 

  the most significant international producing property is the exxonmobiloperated zafiro oil field on block b offshore equatorial guinea in west africa during 2005 our share of production from zafiro averaged 37 mbbls per day we expect to drill nine development wells on block b in 2006 we drilled a discovery on the esmeralda prospect on block b in 2005 we have also identified exploratory prospects on 

24 block b and on three additional blocks in equatorial guinea three exploratory wells are planned on block p in 2006 we drilled a discovery well on the venus prospect on block p in 2005 

  our second most significant international producing asset is our panyu project offshore china panyu in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea was discovered in 1998 panyu production began late in 2003 we drilled and completed five successful development wells and tested two exploratory prospects during 2005 during 2005 our share of production from china was 15 mbbls per day 

  we also have an active offshore exploration program in brazil we made a discovery in 2004 offshore brazil on block bmc8 development of the polvo discovery commenced in 2005 and first production is expected in 2007 we in partnership with petrobras on three blocks were the successful bidder on three offshore blocks in brazil’s bid round seven in 2005 we expect to drill five exploration wells in brazil in 2006 

  in azerbaijan we have a 56 carried working interest in the azerichiraggunashli or acg oil development project in the caspian sea we estimate that the acg field contains over five billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves oil production from the acg field began ramping up in 2005 after the central azeri platform came online based on economic factors existing at december 31 2005 our net share of acg production is expected to increase to between 30 to 35 mbbls per day in early 2007 when payout is reached 

  we also hold interests in angola cote d’ivoire egypt gabon ghana indonesia nigeria and russia exploratory wells in egypt and nigeria are planned for 2006 

title to properties 

  title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

  as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations generally including a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend introduction 

  the following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business financial condition and overall performance this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future reference is made to “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the following is discussed and analyzed 

 overview of business 

  devon is the largest usbased independent oil and gas producer and one of the largest independent processors of natural gas and natural gas liquids in north america our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable production and a platform for future growth about 88 percent of our production is from north america we also operate in selected international areas including azerbaijan brazil china egypt russia and west africa our production mix is about 61 percent natural gas and 39 percent oil and natural gas liquids such as propane butane and ethane we produce 23 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in north america 

  in managing our global operations we have an operating strategy that is focused on creating and increasing value per share key elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves growing production and exercising capital discipline we must also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks to achieve longterm success the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors 

 30  overview of 2005 results and outlook 

  2005 was the best year in our history we continued to execute our strategy to increase value per share as a result we delivered record amounts for certain key measures of our financial and operating performance in 2005 

   we produced 226 million boe in 2005 representing a 10 decrease compared to 2004 excluding the effects of production lost due to the sale of noncore properties in the first half of 2005 and production suspended due to hurricanes in the last half of 2005 our yearoveryear production increased 1 in addition with the significant increase in commodity prices and the weakened us dollar compared to the canadian dollar operating costs also increased per unit lease operating expenses increased 17 to 595 per boe 

  in 2005 we utilized cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sale of noncore properties to fund our 41 billion in capital expenditures repay 13 billion in debt and repurchase 23 billion of our common stock in august 2005 we announced a plan to repurchase up to 50 million additional shares of our common stock by the end of 2007 as of february 28 2006 we had repurchased 44 million shares under this program 

31   we have laid the foundation for continued growth in future years at competitive unitcosts that we expect will create additional value for our investors in 2006 we expect to deliver reserve additions of 410 to 440 million boe with related capital in the range of 46 to 48 billion we expect production to remain relatively flat from 2005 to 2006 for our retained properties however we expect an 8 increase in 2007 production over 2006 reflecting the significant reserve additions in 2004 and 2005 and those expected in 2006 

results of operations 

   changes in oil gas and ngl production prices and revenues from 2003 to 2005 are shown in the following tables unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars 

 32   33   

 n m not meaningful 

  the average prices shown in the preceding tables include the effect of our oil and gas price hedging activities following is a comparison of our average prices with and without the effect of hedges for each of the last three years 

 

   2005 vs 2004 oil revenues increased 276 million in 2005 oil revenues increased 661 million due to a 1026 increase in the average realized price of oil a decrease in 2005 production of 14 million barrels caused oil revenues to decrease by 385 million production lost from the 2005 property divestitures accounted for seven million barrels of the decrease we also suspended certain domestic oil production in 2005 and 2004 due to the effects of hurricanes katrina rita dennis and ivan the year over year impact accounted for an additional one million barrels of suspended production in 2005 than in 2004 the remainder of the decrease is due to certain international properties in which our ownership interest decreased after we recovered our costs under the applicable production sharing contracts 

34   2004 vs 2003 oil revenues increased 614 million in 2004 an increase in 2004 production of 16 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 415 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 14 million barrels of increased production the remaining increase is primarily related to new production from china partially offset by natural production declines and the effects of hurricane ivan on domestic properties in 2004 oil revenues increased 199 million due to a 255 increase in the average realized price of oil 

   2005 vs 2004 gas revenues increased 11 billion in 2005 a 167 per mcf increase in the average realized gas price caused revenues to increase by 14 billion a decrease in 2005 production of 64 bcf caused gas revenues to decrease by 337 million production associated with the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of 89 bcf we also suspended certain domestic gas production in 2005 and 2004 due to the effects of hurricanes katrina rita dennis and ivan the year over year impact accounted for an additional 12 bcf of suspended production in 2005 than in 2004 these decreases were more than offset by new drilling and development and increased performance in us offshore and onshore properties 

  2004 vs 2003 gas revenues increased 835 million in 2004 an 081 per mcf increase in the average realized gas price caused revenues to increase by 714 million an increase in 2004 production of 28 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 121 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 43 bcf of increased production this was offset by a production decrease in domestic properties as a result of natural declines and the effects of hurricane ivan in 2004 

   2005 vs 2004 ngl revenues increased 133 million in 2005 a 592 per barrel increase in average ngl prices caused revenues to increase by 141 million a slight decrease in 2005 production due to 2005 property divestitures and suspended production in 2005 due to hurricanes katrina rita and dennis caused revenues to decrease by 8 million 

  2004 vs 2003 ngl revenues increased 147 million in 2004 a 439 per barrel increase in average ngl prices caused revenues to increase by 106 million an increase in 2004 production of 2 million barrels caused revenues to increase 41 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 06 million barrels of increased production the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties 

   2005 vs 2004 marketing and midstream revenues increased 91 million in 2005 of this increase approximately 442 million was the result of higher overall market prices for natural gas and ngls this was partially offset by 338 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 and 2005 additionally revenues decreased 13 million primarily due to lower thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes 

  2004 vs 2003 marketing and midstream revenues increased 241 million in 2004 of this increase approximately 218 million was the result of higher overall market prices for natural gas and ngls additionally revenues increased 103 million due to higher thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes this was partially offset by 80 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 

   the details of the changes in oil gas and ngl production and operating expenses between 2003 and 2005 are shown in the table below 

  

   2005 vs 2004 lease operating expenses increased 65 million in 2005 the increase in lease operating expense was largely caused by higher commodity prices with the increase in oil gas and ngl prices more well workovers and repairs and maintenance costs were performed to either maintain or improve production volumes other costs including ad valorem taxes power and fuel costs increased primarily as a result of higher commodity prices additionally changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate resulted in a 30 million increase in costs partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of 144 million in lease operating expenses related to properties that were sold in 2005 

  the increases described above were also the primary factors causing lease operating expenses per boe to increase although we divested properties that had higher perunit operating costs the cost escalation largely related to higher commodity prices and the weaker us dollar compared to the canadian dollar had a greater effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures 

  production taxes increased 80 million in 2005 the majority of our production taxes are assessed on our onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 18 increase in domestic oil gas and ngl revenues was the primary cause of the production tax increase in addition production taxes related to our international production increased 26 million due to higher export tax rates in russia as well as higher oil revenues in china and russia 

  2004 vs 2003 lease operating expenses increased 202 million in 2004 the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 84 million of the increase lease operating expenses on our historical properties increased 88 million due to an increase in well workover expenses ad valorem taxes and power fuel casualty insurance and repairs and maintenance costs additionally changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate resulted in a 30 million increase in costs 

  the increase in lease operating expenses per boe is primarily related to increased well workover expenses ad valorem taxes and power fuel and repairs and maintenance costs as well as the changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate 

  production taxes increased 51 million in 2004 the 22 increase in domestic oil gas and ngl revenues was the primary cause of the production tax increase 

   dda of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year by the “depletable base” the depletable base represents the net capitalized investment plus future development costs in those reserves generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

  2005 vs 2004 oil and gas property related dda decreased 110 million in 2005 dda decreased 210 million due to a 10 decrease in the combined oil gas and ngl production in 2005 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the consolidated dda rate from 854 per boe in 2004 to 899 per boe in 2005 which caused oil and gas property related dda to increase by 100 million in 2005 finding and development costs for reserve discoveries and extensions were lower than previous years but were higher than the 2004 dda rate of 854 which caused the 2005 rate to increase 049 with the higher commodity prices current development costs and estimates of future development costs increased in 2005 compared to 2004 in addition changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate caused the rate to increase 017 these increases were partially offset by a 021 decrease in the rate as a result of our 2005 property divestitures 

  2004 vs 2003 oil and gas property related dda increased 473 million in 2004 an increase in the consolidated dda rate from 733 per boe in 2003 to 854 per boe in 2004 caused oil and gas property related dda to increase by 305 million the increase in the dda rate is primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger negative reserve revisions in canada and certain international countries subject to production sharing contracts and changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate a 10 increase in 2004 oil gas and ngl production caused dda to increase 168 million 

   2005 vs 2004 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 3 million in 2005 of this increase approximately 306 million was the result of an increase in prices paid for natural gas and ngls this was partially offset by 297 million in lower costs and expenses resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 and 2005 additionally operating costs and expenses decreased 6 million primarily due to lower thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes 

  2004 vs 2003 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 165 million in 2004 of this increase approximately 133 million was the result of an increase in prices paid for natural gas and ngls additionally operating costs and expenses increased 106 million due to higher thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes this was partially offset by 74 million in lower costs and expenses resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 

   our net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we serve as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes 

37 expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

   2005 vs 2004 gross ga increased 35 million higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross ga to increase 38 million of this increase 17 million related to higher restricted stock compensation primarily due to our december 2005 and 2004 grants in addition changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate caused a 9 million increase in costs these increases were offset by an 8 million decrease in rent expense resulting primarily from the abandonment of certain canadian office space in 2004 

  the 17 million increase in capitalized ga resulted primarily from the higher salaries and benefits related to oil and gas exploration and development capital projects in addition changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate caused capitalized ga to increase 3 million 

  2004 vs 2003 gross ga increased 25 million the april 2003 ocean merger increased gross expenses 27 million primarily due to the inclusion of an additional four months of ocean activities in 2004 compared to 2003 also higher compensation and benefit costs increased charitable contributions and the abandonment of certain canadian office space increased gross ga 26 million 12 million and 5 million respectively during 2004 we also incurred 6 million of incremental professional fees related to additional activities performed to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 finally changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate resulted in a 8 million increase in costs these increases were partially offset by the synergies obtained from the ocean merger 

  the increase in both capitalized ga of 32 million and reimbursed ga of 23 million was primarily related to the increased activity subsequent to the april 2003 ocean merger 

   during 2005 and 2003 we reduced the carrying value of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities a detailed description of how full cost ceiling limitations are determined is included in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this report a summary of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below 

 

   our interests in angola were acquired through the ocean energy acquisition our drilling program has been unsuccessful in angola resulting in no proven reserves for the country after drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that all of the angolan capitalized costs should be impaired devon has a commitment to drill one additional well in angola by the end of august 2006 

  prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 we were capitalizing the costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in brazil pending the determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in brazil we have been successful in our drilling efforts on block bmc8 in brazil and are currently developing our polvo project on this block the ultimate value of the polvo project is expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in brazil which were capitalized however the polvo proved reserves will be recorded over a period of time it is expected that a small initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at polvo will be recorded in 2006 based on preliminary estimates developed in the fourth quarter of 2005 the value of this initial partial booking of proved reserves will not be sufficient to offset the sum of the related proportionate polvo costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts therefore we determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to the polvo project should be impaired these costs totaled approximately 42 million there is no tax benefit related to the brazilian impairment 

   the egyptian reduction was primarily due to poor results of a development well that was unsuccessful in the primary objective partially as a result of this well we revised egyptian proved reserves downward the russian reduction was primarily the result of additional capital costs incurred as well as an increase in operating costs the indonesian reduction was primarily related to an increase in operating costs and a reduction in proved reserves 

  additionally during 2003 we elected to discontinue certain exploratory activities in ghana certain properties in brazil and other smaller concessions after meeting the drilling and capital commitments on 

39 these properties we determined that these properties did not meet our internal criteria to justify further investment accordingly we recorded a charge associated with the impairment of these properties 

   the following schedule includes the components of interest expense between 2003 and 2005 

   2005 vs 2004 the average debt balance decreased from 82 billion in 2004 to 74 billion in 2005 due to debt repayments during 2004 and 2005 this decrease in debt outstanding caused interest expense to decrease 53 million this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a 47 million increase due to higher floating rates in 2005 the average interest rate on outstanding debt increased from 63 in 2004 to 68 in 2005 

  other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 64 million higher in 2005 of this increase 51 million related to the early retirement premium for the redemption of the 400 million 675 notes and 25 million related to the loss on the early redemption of the zero coupon convertible senior debentures in conjunction with the early redemption of the senior debentures we also expensed 5 million in remaining unamortized issuance costs this was partially offset by 16 million of unamortized debt issuance costs that were expensed in the second quarter of 2004 upon the early repayment of the outstanding balance under our 3 billion term loan credit facility 

  2004 vs 2003 the average debt balance outstanding decreased from 86 billion in 2003 to 82 billion in 2004 causing interest expense to decrease 22 million the decrease in average debt outstanding was due to debt repayments during 2004 the average interest rate on outstanding debt increased from 62 in 2003 to 63 in 2004 the higher rate in 2004 caused interest expense to increase 4 million 

  other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 9 million lower in 2004 of this decrease 20 million related to the capitalization of interest the increase in interest capitalized was primarily related to additional unproved properties acquired from the april 2003 ocean energy merger and the nature of the properties acquired the ocean properties included significant deepwater gulf and international exploratory properties and major development projects the effect of the 20 million increase in capitalized interest was partially offset by the 16 million of debt issuance costs that were expensed in 2004 as a result of the early repayment of the outstanding balance under our 3 billion term loan credit facility 

   our canadian subsidiary which has designated the canadian dollar as its functional currency had 400 million 675 senior notes outstanding which were denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar while the notes were outstanding increased or decreased the expected amount of canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes in addition our canadian subsidiary has cash and other working capital amounts denominated in us dollars which 

40 also fluctuate in value with changes in the exchange rate such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt and working capital balances are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes 

  the changes in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate from 08308 at december 31 2004 to 08503 at the redemption date of the canadian senior notes resulted in a gain of 9 million in 2005 also in 2005 our canadian subsidiary purchased us dollars related to our repatriation of 535 million of earnings from our canadian operations to the us as a result of a decrease in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate while these us dollars were held we recognized a 7 million loss in 2005 the increase in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate from 07738 at december 31 2003 to 08308 at december 31 2004 resulted in a 22 million gain the increase in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate from 06331 at december 31 2002 to 07738 at december 31 2003 resulted in a 69 million gain 

   the details of the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments between 2003 and 2005 are shown in the table below 

   the change in fair value of the option embedded in debentures exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock decreased 4 million and increased 61 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the value of this option is driven primarily by the price of chevron corporation’s common stock generally as the price of chevron corporation’s common stock increases we recognize a larger loss on the option 

  in 2005 we recognized a 39 million loss on certain oil derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual and projected production under these contracts the lower than expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that affected offshore production in the gulf of mexico 

   the following schedule includes the components of other income between 2003 and 2005 

   2005 vs 2004 other income increased 93 million in 2005 other income increased 117 million due to gains resulting from sales of certain nonoil and gas properties in 2005 interest and dividend income increased 50 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in cash and shortterm investment balances and higher interest rates the 2005 loss on derivative financial instruments resulted primarily from a 

41 55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end of their original term these hedges related to us and canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005 property divestiture program this loss was partially offset by a 7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction with the early redemption of the 400 million 675 senior notes in 2005 

  2004 vs 2003 other income increased 66 million in 2004 other income increased 36 million due to gains resulting from sales of certain nonoil and gas properties in 2004 interest and dividend income increased 12 million in 2004 due to an increase in cash and shortterm investment balances 

   2005 vs 2004 our 2005 effective financial tax rate was 36 compared to 34 in 2004 both rates approximated the 35 statutory federal tax rate income taxes were reduced by 14 million and 36 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively related to canadian statutory rate reductions the 2005 rate also included 28 million of additional tax related to our repatriation of 545 million substantially all of which was canadian earnings from our canadian subsidiary to the us 

  2004 vs 2003 our 2004 effective financial tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 34 compared to 23 in 2003 both years’ rates were affected by the incremental effect of state income taxes offset by the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions in addition both the 2004 and 2003 rates included benefits from canadian statutory rate reductions of 36 million and 218 million respectively excluding the effect of the 2003 canadian rate reduction the 2003 effective tax rate would have been 33 

   effective january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations and recorded a cumulativeeffecttype adjustment for an increase to net earnings of 16 million net of deferred taxes of 10 million 

  in september 2004 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 106 “sab no 106” to provide guidance regarding the interaction of sfas no 143 with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties specifically sab no 106 clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and dda should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 143 we adopted sab no 106 in the fourth quarter of 2004 however this adoption did not materially impact our full cost ceiling test calculation or dda for 2004 

capital resources uses and liquidity 

  the following discussion of capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

   at december 31 2005 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 23 billion during 2005 2004 and 2003 such balances increased 167 million 846 million and 981 million respectively the following table summarizes the changes in our cash and cash equivalents from 2003 to 2005 additional discussion of the key elements contributing to these changes follows the table 

 

   net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” is our primary source of capital and liquidity operating cash flow is largely affected by our net earnings excluding large noncash expenses such as depreciation depletion and amortization and deferred income tax expense as a result our operating cash flow increased in 2005 and 2004 compared to the previous years due to increases in net earnings as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

   capital expenditures the increases in operating cash flow enabled us to invest larger amounts in capital projects as a result our capital expenditures increased 32 to 41 billion in 2005 the majority of this increase related to our expenditures for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties which totaled 39 billion in 2005 increased drilling activities in the barnett shale the approximately 200 million acquisition of iron river acreage in canada and the 74 million purchase of the serpentina fpso in offshore equatorial guinea were large contributors to the increase significant cost escalation and the weaker us dollar also caused our expenditures to increase from 2004 to 2005 

  capital expenditures also increased 20 to 31 billion in 2004 our april 2003 merger with ocean energy was the primary cause of this increase because 2003 only included eight months of capital activity related to the ocean energy properties acquired 

  proceeds from sales of property and equipment in 2005 we generated 22 billion in proceeds from sales this consisted primarily of 20 billion in pretax proceeds net of all purchase price adjustments related to the sale of noncore oil and gas properties in addition we sold noncore midstream assets for 02 billion in pretax proceeds net of related income taxes these proceeds were 18 billion for oil and gas properties and 01 billion for midstream assets 

  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were 95 million and 179 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively these amounts consisted primarily of proceeds related to the sale of noncore midstream assets 

  changes in shortterm investments to maximize our income on available cash balances we invest in highly liquid shortterm investments the purchase and sale of these shortterm investments will cause 

43 cash and cash equivalents to decrease and increase respectively shortterm investment balances decreased 287 million in 2005 increased 626 million in 2004 and increased 341 million in 2003 

   net debt repayments our net debt retirements were 13 billion 10 billion and 05 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the 2005 amount includes 08 billion related to the retirement of the zero coupon convertible debentures and the 400 million 675 notes due march 2011 before their scheduled maturity dates the 2004 amount includes 635 million for the payment of the outstanding balance under our 3 billion term loan credit facility the 2003 amount includes payments on certain debt instruments assumed in the april 2003 ocean energy merger 

  stock repurchases we are utilizing operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of noncore oil and gas properties to repurchase our common stock in august 2005 we completed the stock repurchase program announced september 27 2004 under this program we repurchased 446 million shares at a total cost of 21 billion in 2005 and 50 million shares at a total cost of 189 million in 2004 subsequent to the completion of the program announced in 2004 we announced on august 3 2005 a new program under this new program we may repurchase up to 50 million shares by the end of 2007 in 2005 we purchased 22 million shares at a total cost of 134 million under this new repurchase program 

  dividends our common stock dividends were 136 million 97 million and 39 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we also paid 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2005 2004 and 2003 the 2005 increase in common stock dividends was primarily related to a 50 increase in the dividend rate in the first quarter of 2005 partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares due to share repurchases the 2004 increase in common stock dividends resulted from a 100 increase in the dividend rate in the first quarter of 2004 and an increase in outstanding shares due to the april 2003 ocean energy merger 

  issuance of common stock proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were 124 million 268 million and 155 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively these proceeds were derived primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 

   historically our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain a revolving line of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and longterm debt we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund future capital expenditures common stock repurchases and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

   our operating cash flow has increased nearly 50 since 2003 reaching a total of 56 billion in 2005 our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls produced prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict we expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity 

   another source of liquidity is our 15 billion fiveyear syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the senior credit facility includes i a fiveyear revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million and ii a 1 billion sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit including letters of credit under the canadian subfacility amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to 

44 twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate however we may elect to borrow at the prime rate as of december 31 2005 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility the available capacity under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2005 net of 310 million of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 12 billion 

  the senior credit facility matures on april 8 2010 and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 8 anniversary date we have the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders we are working to obtain lender approval to extend the current maturity date of april 8 2010 to april 8 2011 if successful this maturity date extension will be effective april 7 2006 provided we have not experienced a “material adverse effect” as defined in the senior credit facility agreement at that date 

  the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements as defined in the agreement total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevron corporation common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2005 our ratio as calculated pursuant to this covenant was 270 

  our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our senior credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect the obligation of the banks to fund the senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

  we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 725 million also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven and 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days we had no commercial paper debt outstanding at december 31 2005 

   we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies our current debt ratings are bbb with a positive outlook by standard  poor’s baa2 with a stable outlook by moody’s and bbb with a stable outlook by fitch 

  there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level our cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs for the senior credit facility from libor plus 70 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 875 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access future debt markets as of december 31 2005 we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

   in february 2006 we announced our 2006 capital expenditures budget our 2006 capital expenditures are expected to range from 50 billion to 52 billion this represents the largest planned use of our 2006 operating cash flow and is 20 to 30 higher than the 2005 capital expenditures to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2006 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2006 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2006 we anticipate that our capital resources will be more than adequate to fund 2006 capital expenditures 

   during 2006 and 2007 we may repurchase up to 478 million additional shares in conjunction with our stock repurchase program announced in august 2005 we anticipate the shares would be repurchased with operating cash flow the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 

   a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 is provided in the following table

   funded status as compared to the “projected benefit obligation” our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 133 million and 132 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively a detailed reconciliation of the 2005 changes to our underfunded status is included in note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 133 million underfunded status at the end of 2005 126 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2005 these trusts had investments with a fair value of 59 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  as compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation” our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by 37 million at december 31 2005 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels our current intentions are to provide sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated benefit obligation remains fully funded the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets required contributions also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period particularly the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2006 we expect our contributions to the plan to be less than 10 million 

  pension estimate assumptions our pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 26 million 26 million and 35 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 31 million in 2006 

  the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions we believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

  we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 840 and 834 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm 

47 inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets the target investment allocation for our plan assets is 50 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities we expect our longterm asset allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

  pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 840 to 740 would increase the expected 2006 pension expense by 5 million 

  we discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 572 at december 31 2005 compared to 574 at december 31 2004 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

  the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 572 to 547 would increase our pension liability at december 31 2005 by 23 million and increase estimated 2006 pension expense by 3 million 

  at december 31 2005 we had unrecognized actuarial losses of 195 million which will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years these losses are primarily due to reductions in the discount rate since 2001 we estimate that approximately 12 million and 11 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2006 and 2007 respectively the 12 million estimated to be recognized in 2006 is a component of the total estimated 2006 pension expense of 31 million referred to earlier in this section 

  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

  on november 10 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” announced that it expects to make significant changes in the disclosure and measurement rules for pension benefits these expected changes will be made in two stages the first stage of rule changes are expected to be issued in 2006 these rule changes are expected to require companies to recognize a pension asset or liability equal to the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as a result unrecognized actuarial losses and other unrecognized costs that are used to calculate the pension asset or liability under current rules will be recognized immediately as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity had these rule changes been effective december 31 2005 our stockholders’ equity would have decreased less than 1 the second stage of this project is expected to take several years before rule changes are presented 

contingencies and legal matters 

  for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual amounts could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 

48   the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates related to those policies are described below we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

   we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if our net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes is in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 

  if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

   the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers see note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual revisions to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 1 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that a 10 discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs rather they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of 

49 the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endof period price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place this adjustment requires little judgment as the endof period price is adjusted using the contract prices for our cash flow hedges we had no such hedges outstanding at december 31 2005 

  because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile on any particular day at the end of a quarter prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

   historically we have used oil and gas derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility we have also used interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to interest rate volatility the interest rate swaps mitigate either the effects on interest expense for variablerate debt instruments or the debt fair values for fixedrate debt we are not involved in any speculative trading activities of derivatives all derivatives requiring balance sheet recognition are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value at december 31 2005 the only derivative financial instruments outstanding consisted of interest rate swaps 

  prior to december 31 2005 a substantial portion of our derivatives consisted of contracts that hedged the price of future oil and natural gas production at inception these derivative contracts were cash flow hedges that qualified for hedge accounting treatment therefore while fair values of such hedging instruments are estimated as of the end of each reporting period the changes in the fair values attributable to the effective portion of these hedging instruments are not included in our consolidated results of operations instead the changes in fair value of the effective portion of these hedging instruments net of tax are recorded directly to stockholders’ equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced the ineffective portion of these hedging instruments is included in our consolidated results of operations 

  to qualify for hedge accounting treatment we designate our cash flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business combination which includes cash flow hedge instruments additionally we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions we also assess both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items if we fail to meet the requirements for using hedge accounting treatment changes in fair value of these hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to equity but in the consolidated results of operations 

   the estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative contracts require substantial judgment for these contracts we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter in addition we estimate the option value of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional price differentials 

50 and interest rates fair values of our other derivative contracts require less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers 

  quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal impact on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations as long as the derivative contracts qualify for treatment as a hedge however settlements of derivative contracts do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative contracts our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

 

   we have grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 

  under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

   there are various assumptions we make in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

  however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies endof period price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 

  we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital 

  we also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we 

51 consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

  generally in our business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that we assume in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

  except for the 2002 mitchell merger our mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

  the mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that we also acquired from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

  in addition to the valuation methods described above we perform other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

  in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination we compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

  in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently we compare these comparable transaction multiples to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

  in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction we use this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

  while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher 

52 future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it is a noncash charge but it would adversely affect results of operations as discussed in the capital resources uses and liquidity section of this report in calculating our debtto capitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

  our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years our annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged approximately 1 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

 

   goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment 

   generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 

  due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth 

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 regarding stockbased employee compensation plans apb opinion no 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the stock option exercise price on the date of grant additionally sfas no 123 established fair valuebased accounting for stockbased employee compensation plans but allowed pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period also pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of sharebased payments is no longer an alternative we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method under this method we will recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards granted or modified on or after january 1 2006 as well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested as of january 1 2006 compensation expense will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 based on our current estimates of the amount of 2006 stock option grants and the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these 

53 stock option grants we expect stock option expense net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties will be approximately 35 million no retroactive or cumulative effect adjustments will be recorded upon adoption 

2006 estimates 

  the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on our examination of historical operating trends the information which was used to prepare the december 31 2005 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties these forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for our oil natural gas and ngls during 2006 will be substantially similar to those of 2005 unless otherwise noted we make reference to the “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2006 exchange rate of 087 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar 

   set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates of oil gas and ngl production for 2006 on a combined basis we estimate our 2006 oil gas and ngl production will total approximately 217 mmboe of this total approximately 95 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2005 

   oil production in 2006 is expected to total approximately 58 mmbbls of this total approximately 99 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2005 the expected production by area is as follows 

   oil prices 

  we have not fixed the price we will receive on any of our 2006 oil production our 2006 average prices for each of our areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma 

 54 

   gas production in 2006 is expected to total approximately 820 bcf of this total approximately 94 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2005 the expected production by area is as follows 

 

   the price for approximately 2 of our estimated 2006 natural gas production has been fixed via various fixedprice physical delivery contracts the following table includes information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the prices have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the prices recorded by us and the prices have also been adjusted for the expected btu content of the gas hedged 

 

   for the natural gas production for which prices have not been fixed our 2006 average prices for each of our areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is determined to be the firstof month south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

 

   we expect our 2006 production of ngls to total approximately 22 mmbbls of this total 97 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2005 the expected production by area is as follows 

 

   marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from our natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of natural gas and 

55 ngls provisions of the contract agreements and the amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels 

  these factors coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl prices increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that 2006 marketing and midstream revenues will be between 174 billion and 220 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 138 billion and 180 billion 

   our production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from the property base changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties the amount of repair and workover activity required and changes in production tax rates oil natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

  given these uncertainties we estimate that 2006 lease operating expenses including transportation costs will be between 143 billion and 150 billion and production taxes will be between 325 and 375 of consolidated oil natural gas and ngl revenues 

   the 2006 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2006 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts and the revisions to our yearend 2005 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2006 

  given these uncertainties we expect oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 930 per boe and 950 per boe based on these dda rates and the production estimates set forth earlier oil and gas property related dda expense for 2006 is expected to be between 202 billion and 206 billion 

  additionally we expect depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets to total between 170 million and 180 million 

   the 2006 accretion of asset retirement obligation is expected to be between 48 million and 53 million 

   our ga includes employee compensation and benefits costs and the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business ga varies with the level of our operating activities and the related staffing and professional services requirements in addition employee compensation and benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to employees also goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases therefore significant variances in any of these factors from current expectations could cause actual ga to vary materially from the estimate 

  given these limitations consolidated ga in 2006 is expected to be between 360 million and 380 million this estimate includes 35 million of expenses related to restricted stock compensation costs net of related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties this estimate also includes 35 million of expenses related to stock option compensation costs net of related capitalization 

   we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties described in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates” reductions to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our quarterly reporting periods due to the uncertain nature of future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices we are not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in 2006 

   future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on our interest expense we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2006 from sales of oil natural gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future interest expense other factors which affect interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are within our control 

  based on the information related to interest expense set forth below and assuming no material changes in our expected level of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates we expect our 2006 interest expense net of amounts capitalized will be between 385 million and 395 million details of this estimate are discussed in the following paragraphs 

  the interest expense in 2006 related to our fixedrate debt including net accretion of related discounts will be approximately 410 million this fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but not all of our longterm debt our floating rate debt is discussed in the following paragraphs 

  we have various debt instruments which have been converted to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps our floating rate debt is as follows 

  

   based on future libor rates as of january 31 2006 interest expense on our floating rate debt including net amortization of premiums is expected to total between 35 million and 45 million in 2006 

  our interest expense totals include payments of facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs the effect of interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding we expect between 5 million and 15 million of such items to be included in 2006 interest expense also we expect to capitalize between 65 million and 75 million of interest during 2006 

   foreign currency gains or losses are not expected to be material in 2006 

   our other revenues in 2006 are expected to be between 155 million and 175 million 

  we maintain a comprehensive insurance program that includes coverage for physical damage to our offshore facilities caused by hurricanes our insurance program also includes substantial business 

57 interruption coverage which we expect to utilize to recover costs associated with the suspended production related to hurricanes that struck the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of 2005 under the terms of the insurance program we are entitled to be reimbursed for the portion of production suspended longer than fortyfive days subject to upper limits to oil and natural gas prices also the terms of the insurance include a standard perevent deductible of 1 million for offshore losses as well as a 15 million aggregate annual deductible based on current estimates of physical damage and the anticipated length of time we will have production suspended we expect our policy settlements will exceed repair costs and deductible amounts as a result 2006 and 2007 other revenues are expected to include more than 150 million for anticipated insurance proceeds in excess of repair costs this estimate is dependent upon several variables including the actual amount of time that production is suspended the actual prices in effect while production is suspended and the timing of collections of insurance proceeds based on current estimates of the timing of collections of insurance proceeds we expect 2006 other revenues will include 50 million to 70 million for anticipated insurance proceeds with the balance to be recorded in 2007 significant variances in any of these factors from current estimates could cause actual 2006 other revenues to vary materially from the estimate 

   our financial income tax rate in 2006 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2006 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2006 income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced 

  given the uncertainty of pretax earnings we expect our consolidated financial income tax rate in 2006 will be between 25 and 45 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 20 and 30 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 5 and 15 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on the 2006 financial income tax rates 

 

   though we have completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not budget nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions if any 

  our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from our price expectations for future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2006 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

  given the limitations discussed above the following table shows expected drilling development and facilities expenditures by geographic area production capital related to proved reserves relates to reserves classified as proved as of yearend 2005 other production capital includes development drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a 

58 known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

   in addition to the above expenditures for drilling development and facilities we expect to spend between 255 million to 275 million on marketing and midstream assets which include our oil pipelines gas processing plants co 2 removal facilities and gas transport pipelines we also expect to capitalize between 230 million and 240 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 65 million and 75 million of interest we also expect to pay between 35 million and 45 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 130 million and 140 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets 

   we expect to continue the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend with the current 01125 per share quarterly dividend rate and 443 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2005 dividends are expected to approximate 200 million also we have 150 million of 649 cumulative preferred stock upon which we will pay 10 million of dividends in 2006 

  on august 3 2005 we announced our intention to repurchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock this stock repurchase program is planned to extend through 2007 during this period shares may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions we plan to repurchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions as of february 28 2006 we had repurchased 44 million shares under the program for 267 million 

   our estimated 2006 cash uses including drilling and development activities and repurchase of common stock are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of working capital which totaled 13 billion at the end of 2005 and operating cash flow the remainder if any could be funded with borrowings from our credit facility we expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2006 without the use of the available credit facility 

  if significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year we could utilize our existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

   our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years see “item 1a risk factors” 

  currently we are largely accepting the volatility risk that oil and natural gas prices present none of our future oil and natural gas production is subject to price swaps or collars in addition none of our estimated 2006 oil production and only 2 of our estimated 2006 natural gas production is subject to fixedprice physical delivery contracts as summarized in the table below 

   in addition we have fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2007 through 2011 covering canadian natural gas production ranging from seven bcf to 14 bcf per year we also have fixedprice physical delivery contracts covering international gas production of four bcf per year in 2007 and three bcf in 2008 

  interest rate risk 

  at december 31 2005 we had debt outstanding of 66 billion of this amount 55 billion or 84 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 74 

  the remaining 11 billion of debt outstanding bears interest at floating rates included in the floatingrate debt is fixedrate debt which has been converted to floatingrate debt through interest rate swaps following is a table summarizing the fixedto floating interest rate swaps with the related debt instrument and notional amounts 

  

   we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of our interest rate swap instruments at december 31 2005 a 10 increase in the underlying interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our interest rate swaps by 8 million 

  the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the shortterm maturity of such instruments 

   our net assets net earnings and cash flows from our canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period a 10 unfavorable change in the canadianto us dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our december 31 2005 balance sheet

 item 1 business tableend general 

  devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the acquisition of producing properties the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas through its predecessors devon began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 devon’s common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in october 2004 devon transferred its common stock listing to the new york stock exchange 

  the principal and administrative offices of devon are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611 

  devon operates oil and gas properties in the united states canada and various regions located outside north america devon’s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast canadian properties are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia properties outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan china egypt and areas in west africa including equatorial guinea gabon and cote d’ivoire in addition to its oil and gas operations devon has marketing and midstream operations these include marketing natural gas crude oil and ngls and the construction and operation of pipelines storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of devon’s significant properties and associated 2004 developments can be found under “item 2 properties” 

  at december 31 2004 devon’s estimated proved reserves were 2077 mmboe of which 60 were natural gas reserves and 40 were oil and ngl reserves 

availability of reports 

  devon makes available free of charge on its internet website wwwdevonenergycom its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes them to the sec 

strategy 

  devon’s primary objectives are to build reserves production cash flow and earnings per share by a exploring for new oil and gas reserves b acquiring oil and gas properties and c optimizing production and value from existing oil and gas properties devon’s management seeks to achieve these objectives by a concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale b acquiring and developing high profit margin properties c continually disposing of marginal and nonstrategic properties d balancing reserves between oil and gas e maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility and f enhancing the value of devon’s production and reserves through marketing and midstream activities 

development of business 

  during 1988 devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years devon has used a twopronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling activities to achieve this expansion total proved reserves increased from 8 mmboe at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests to 2077 mmboe at yearend 2004 

5   during the same time period proved reserves have grown from 066 boe per diluted share at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 416 boe per diluted share at yearend 2004 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 11 another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share production increased from 009 boe per diluted share in 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 050 boe per diluted share in 2004 a compound annual growth rate of 11 

  during 2004 devon drilled 274 exploration wells and over 1900 development wells see further discussion of devon’s 2004 exploration and drilling efforts in “item 2 properties” 

  cash flow from operations was 48 billion for 2004 this allowed devon to fully fund its 31 billion of capital expenditures retire approximately 1 billion in longterm debt and add 846 million to cash and shortterm investments the 21 billion of cash and shortterm investments as of december 31 2004 is adequate to cover debt maturities through 2007 

  on september 27 2004 devon announced two significant initiatives first devon plans to divest oil and gas properties in the offshore gulf of mexico and onshore in the united states and canada representing approximately 9 of proved north american reserves by divesting these properties devon expects to lengthen the overall reserve life and lower the overall cost structure and improve operating efficiency of its retained properties devon began the divestiture process in the fourth quarter of 2004 and expects to complete the sale of most of the properties in the first half of 2005 aftertax sale proceeds are expected to range between 10 billion and 15 billion and will be used to partially fund the stock buyback program described below 

  second devon announced a stock buyback program to repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common stock devon began repurchasing its shares in the open market during october 2004 as of february 28 2005 devon had repurchased 125 million shares at a total cost of 501 million or 4004 per share devon intends to continue repurchasing its shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions the shares will be repurchased with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the planned sales of oil and gas properties discussed previously the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 

  additionally devon announced the declaration of a twoforone split of devon’s outstanding common stock the stock split was applicable to stockholders of record at the close of business on october 29 2004 the stock split was accomplished through a stock dividend paid on november 15 2004 all references in this document to shares of devon common stock or to amounts based on shares of such stock outstanding have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of this stock split 

  on april 25 2003 devon completed its merger with ocean energy inc “ocean” in the transaction devon issued 0828 shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of ocean common stock or a total of approximately 148 million shares also devon assumed approximately 18 billion of debt from ocean the ocean merger added approximately 554 million boe to devon’s proved reserves 

  on january 24 2002 devon completed its merger with mitchell energy  development corp “mitchell” under the terms of this merger devon issued approximately 60 million shares of devon common stock and paid 16 billion in cash to the mitchell stockholders the mitchell merger added approximately 404 million boe to devon’s proved reserves 

  on october 15 2001 devon acquired anderson exploration ltd “anderson” for approximately 35 billion in cash the anderson acquisition added approximately 534 million boe to devon’s proved reserves 

  to fund the cash portions of the mitchell merger and the anderson acquisition as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain longterm debt assumed from mitchell and anderson devon entered into longterm debt agreements in october 2001 that totaled 6 billion half of this total consisted of 3 billion of notes and debentures issued on october 3 2001 of this total 125 billion bears interest 

6 at 7875 and matures in september 2031 the remaining 175 billion bears interest at 6875 and matures in september 2011 

  the remaining 3 billion of the 6 billion of longterm debt was borrowed under a credit facility that was repaid in 2004 the primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of 15 billion of debt securities of which 13 billion was used to pay down the credit facility with the remainder used to pay down other debt 14 billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties in 2002 of which 11 billion was used to pay down the credit facility and cash flow from operations 

financial information about segments and geographical areas 

  notes 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contain information on devon’s segments and geographical areas 

drilling activities 

  devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties acquired in the future devon’s 2005 drilling activities will be focused in the rocky mountains permian basin midcontinent gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast areas in the us the western sedimentary basin of canada and in brazil china egypt russia and west africa outside north america 

  the following tables set forth the results of devon’s drilling activity for the past five years 

total properties 

 united states properties 

 7 canadian properties 

 international properties 

  

   as of december 31 2004 devon was participating in the drilling of 147 gross 9064 net wells in the us 53 gross 287 net wells in canada and 40 gross 1003 net wells internationally of these wells through february 1 2005 61 gross 4344 net wells in the us 6 gross 383 net wells in canada and 2 gross 074 net wells internationally had been completed as productive an additional 3 gross 3 net wells in canada were dry holes the remaining wells were still in progress 

customers 

  devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries 

  the principal customers for devon’s crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is trucked or shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities 

  no purchaser accounted for over 10 of devon’s revenues in 2004 

oil and natural gas marketing 

  the spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in various regions of north america fluctuate in addition to fixed price contracts devon periodically enters into financial hedging arrangements or firm delivery commitments with a portion of its oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage devon’s exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

   devon’s oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties 

   devon’s gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2005 approximately 86 of devon’s natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 12 were committed under various longterm contracts which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices devon’s remaining gas production was sold under longterm fixed price contracts 

  typically either the entire contract in the case of shortterm contracts or the price provisions of the contract in the case of longterm contracts are renegotiated from daily intervals up to oneyear intervals the spot market has become progressively more competitive in recent years as a result prices on the spot market have been volatile 

marketing and midstream activities 

  the primary objective of devon’s marketing and midstream group is to add value to devon and other producers to whom devon provides such services by gathering processing and marketing oil and gas production in a timely and efficient manner devon’s most significant marketing and midstream asset is the bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in north texas these facilities serve not only devon’s gas production from the barnett shale but also gas production of other producers in the area 

  devon’s marketing and midstream revenue sources are primarily 1 selling ngls that were either extracted from the gas streams processed by devonowned plants or purchased from third parties for marketing and 2 selling or gathering gas that moves through its gathering systems marketing and midstream costs and expenses are incurred from 1 purchasing the gas streams entering devonowned gathering systems and plants 2 fuel needed to operate its plants compressors and related gathering facilities 3 purchasing thirdparty ngls and 4 expenses incurred operating its plants gathering systems and related facilities 

competition 

  the oil and gas business is highly competitive devon encounters competition from major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel intense competition occurs with respect to marketing particularly of natural gas certain competitors have resources that substantially exceed those of devon 

seasonal nature of business 

  generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 

government regulation 

  devon’s operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the united states canada and international locations in which it operates 

   in the united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation numerous federal state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling pipelines gas processing plants and production activities increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations devon considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business devon has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies 

  exploration and production devon’s united states operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production devon’s operations are also subject to various conservation matters including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in this regard some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally limit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill 

  certain of devon’s oil and gas leases including its offshore gulf of mexico leases most of its leases in the san juan basin and many of devon’s leases in southeast new mexico montana and wyoming are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the minerals management service of the department of the interior “mms” such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act 

  environmental and occupational regulations various federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect devon’s exploration development processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto these laws and regulations increase devon’s overall operating expenses devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however 100 coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by devon because of its violation of any federal state or local law devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws 

10 relating to the protection of the environment devon’s unreimbursed expenditures in 2004 concerning such matters were immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters 

  devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state statutes in response to liabilities associated with these activities accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in devon’s consolidated financial statements devon adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information 

  certain of devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties “prps” under cercla or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties as of december 31 2004 devon’s consolidated balance sheet included 7 million of noncurrent accrued liabilities reflected in “other liabilities” related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities with respect to the sites in which devon subsidiaries are prps devon’s conclusion is based in large part on i devon’s participation in consent decrees with both other prps and the environmental protection agency which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the prps ii participation in groups as a de minimis prp and iii the availability of other defenses to liability as a result devon’s monetary exposure is not expected to be material 

  devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations and the judicial construction of same devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and regulations devon considers the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of its business devon has been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies 

  devon maintains its own internal environmental health and safety department this department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for devon the program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of devon’s compliance procedures 

   the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect devon’s canadian operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size the following are the most important areas of control and regulation 

  exploration and production devon’s canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental regulations such regulations include requiring licenses for the drilling of wells regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce wells surface usage and the restoration of land upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from wells devon’s canadian operations are also subject to various conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of spacing units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the ability to produce oil and gas in canada the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of 

11 oil and gas devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill 

  royalties and incentives each province and the federal government of canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure royalties production rates and taxes environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the governments of canada alberta british columbia and saskatchewan have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow to the producer 

  pricing and marketing the price of oil natural gas and ngls sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers an order from the national energy board “neb” is required for oil exports from canada any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year in the case of light crude and two years in the case of heavy crude requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb the issue of such a license requires the approval of the government of canada natural gas exported from canada is also subject to similar regulation by the neb natural gas exports for a term of less than two years or for a term of two to twenty years in quantities of not more than 20000 mcf per day must be made pursuant to an neb order any natural gas exports to be made pursuant to a contract of larger duration to a maximum of 25 years or in larger quantities require an exporter to obtain a license from the neb which requires the approval of the government of canada exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers provided that the export contracts meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb the governments of alberta british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability transportation arrangements and market considerations 

  environmental regulation the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local provincial and federal legislation environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations in addition legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment devon’s unreimbursed expenditures in 2004 concerning such matters were immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters 

  the north american free trade agreement the north american free trade agreement “nafta” which became effective on january 1 1994 carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canadaus free trade agreement in the context of energy resources canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price or iii disrupt normal channels of supply all parties to nafta are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 

  kyoto protocol in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto protocol this protocol calls for canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012 on february 16 2005 as a result of russian ratification the protocol 

12 became legally binding the protocol is expected to affect the operation of all industries in canada including the oil and gas industry as details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced the effect on devon cannot be determined at this time 

  investment canada act the investment canada act requires government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

   the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration drilling and production activities increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations the following are significant areas of regulation 

  exploration and production devon’s oil and gas concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate among other matters seismic drilling and production operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments taxes and minimum investments to the government 

  regulations include requiring permits for acquiring seismic data drilling wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production devon’s operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill 

  production sharing contracts many of devon’s international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts “pscs” between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years many pscs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages pscs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions for example at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue 

  environmental regulations various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect devon’s exploration development processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto in general this consists of preparing environmental impact assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans waste management plans environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans in some countries the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations additionally the kyoto protocol will have requirements similar to those for canada for the oil and gas industry in azerbaijan brazil china egypt 

13 equatorial guinea nigeria and russia as details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced the effect on devon’s international operations if any cannot be determined at this time 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 devon’s staff consisted of 3900 fulltime employees devon believes that it has good labor relations with its employees 

tablestart 








 item 2 properties tableend   substantially all of devon’s properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in devon’s core operating areas these interests entitle devon to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas devon’s interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty mineral and net profits interests foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties 

  devon also has certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems devon’s most significant midstream assets are its bridgeport assets serving the barnett shale development in north texas these assets include approximately 2400 miles of pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl fractionator 

proved reserves and estimated future net revenue 

  the process of estimating oil gas and ngl reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of among other things additional development activity production history and viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the future 

  devon’s policies regarding booking reserves 1 require proved reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and 2 assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to devon’s reserve evaluation group the “group” the policies also require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators “qres” as defined by the society of petroleum engineers’ standards a list of qres is kept by the senior advisor — corporate reserves all qres are required to receive education covering the fundamentals of sec proved reserves assignments 

  the group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and certification and includes the manager — ep budgets and reserves and the senior advisor — corporate reserves the group reports independently of any of devon’s operating divisions the vice president — planning and evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the group and reports to the president of devon 

  no portion of the group’s compensation is dependent on the quantity of reserves booked 

  throughout the year the group performs internal audits of each operating division’s reserves selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major changes additions and revisions to reserves in addition the group reviews reserve estimates with each of the thirdparty petroleum consultants as discussed below 

  in addition to internal audits devon engages three independent petroleum consulting firms to perform both external reserves preparation and audits ryder scott company lp prepared the reserves estimates for all offshore gulf of mexico properties and for 98 of the international proved reserves laroche petroleum consultants ltd audited the reserves estimates for about 73 of the domestic onshore properties ajm petroleum consultants prepared estimates covering 22 of devon’s canadian reserves 

14   set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated either by preparation or audit by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 

   “prepared” reserves are those estimates of quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by devon employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant an audit is an examination of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates in aggregate are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 

  devon follows what it believes to be a rational approach not only to recording oil and gas reserves but also to subjecting these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants as discussed above the reserve estimates for all of our gulf of mexico and international properties are prepared by an independent petroleum consulting firm every year excluding 2 of devon’s 2004 and 2003 international reserves that were estimated by inhouse engineers additionally in canada an independent petroleum consulting firm prepares approximately a rolling onethird of our properties each year so that the reserve estimates for substantially all the canadian properties are prepared by outside engineers over a threeyear cycle 

  for the us onshore properties reserve estimates of individually significant properties are either prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm while estimates of minor properties are prepared by inhouse engineers this approach results in independent engineers preparing or auditing over 50 of our us onshore reserves each year 

  over any threeyear period more than 95 of devon’s companywide reserve estimates are prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm devon believes this approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates this is evidenced by the fact that in the past five years devon’s annual revisions to its reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 2 of the previous year’s estimate 

  in addition to internal and external reviews three independent members of devon’s board of directors have been assigned to a reserves committee the reserves committee assists the board of directors with the oversight of 1 the annual review and evaluation of devon’s consolidated oil gas and ngl reserves 2 the integrity of devon’s reserves evaluation and reporting system 3 devon’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to reserves evaluation preparation and disclosure 4 the qualifications and independence of devon’s independent engineering consultants and 5 devon’s business practices and ethical standards in relation to the preparation and disclosure of reserves the reserves committee meets at lease twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically meets separately with devon’s senior reserves engineering personnel and its independent petroleum consultants 

15   the following table sets forth devon’s estimated proved reserves and the related estimated pretax future net revenues pretax 10 present value and aftertax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december 31 2004 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 18 to devon’s consolidated financial statements included herein 

  

 16  

 

   as presented in the previous table devon had 1652 mmboe of proved developed reserves at december 31 2004 proved developed reserves consist of proved developed producing reserves and proved developed nonproducing reserves the following table provides additional information regarding devon’s proved developed reserves at december 31 2004 

 17   no estimates of devon’s proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except i in filings with the sec and ii in filings with the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed by devon with the sec correspond with the estimates of devon reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of devon’s reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that devon does not operate 

  the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2004 there can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

production revenue and price history 

  certain information concerning oil natural gas and ngl production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other third party interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2004 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 operation of properties 

  the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions 

  devon is the operator of 19506 of its wells as operator devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting its financial data devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

   devon’s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions canadian properties are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia properties outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan china egypt and areas in west africa including equatorial guinea gabon and cote d’ivoire additionally devon has exploratory interests but no current producing assets in other international countries including angola brazil nigeria and syria maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed devon to improve operating and capital efficiency 

19   the following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which devon’s properties are located as of december 31 2004 

  

 

   the following descriptions of devon’s properties in the united states are as of december 31 2004 devon plans to divest certain of these properties in 2005 information provided below may be materially different after the planned divestitures 

   devon’s permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas these assets include conventional oil and gas properties producing from a wide variety of geologic formations and depths the permian basin represented 9 of devon’s proved reserves at december 31 2004 

  devon’s leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses more than 117000 net acres of developed lands and 231000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals historically devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation 

20   in the west texas portion of the permian basin devon maintains a base of oil production with longlife reserves many of these reserves are from both operated and nonoperated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit the willard unit the reeves unit the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit these oilproducing units often exhibit low decline rates devon also owns a significant acreage position in west texas with over 210000 net acres of developed lands and over 232000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december 31 2004 

   the midcontinent region includes portions of texas oklahoma and kansas these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas devon’s midcontinent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties however the barnett shale in north texas acquired by devon in 2002 is a nonconventional gas resource the midcontinent region represented 20 of devon’s proved reserves at december 31 2004 approximately 77 of devon’s proved reserves in the midcontinent area are in the barnett shale 

  the barnett shale devon’s largest producing field is known as a tight gas formation this means that in its natural state the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas however the application of available technology has made the barnett shale a lowrisk and highly profitable natural gas operation devon holds 535000 net acres and over 1900 producing wells in the barnett shale devon’s average working interest is approximately 95 

  devon has experienced success extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells to increase production rates devon is also applying horizontal drilling closer well spacing and reservoir optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the barnett shale 

  devon’s marketing and midstream operations gather and process its barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties the gathering system consists of approximately 2400 miles of pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl fractionator 

  in 2005 devon plans to drill a total of 226 new barnett shale wells including 156 horizontals and 70 verticals about twothirds of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an effort to further expand the productive area of the field the barnett shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for devon for the foreseeable future current net production from the barnett shale is approximately 93 mboe per day 

   devon’s operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming montana utah and northern new mexico these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed natural gas projects as of december 31 2004 the rocky mountain region comprised 9 of devon’s proved reserves 

  approximately 19 of devon’s proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed natural gas devon began producing coalbed natural gas in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid1980s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in 1998 as of december 31 2004 devon had approximately 1360 producing coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin devon’s net coalbed natural gas production from the basin was approximately 76 mmcf per day as of december 31 2004 devon plans to drill 120 new wells and deepen 44 existing wells in the powder river basin in 2005 current production in the basin is primarily from the wyodak coal formation development of the deeper big george formation is expanding the play into the western portion of the powder river basin devon also plans to plug and abandon 100 wells in the powder river basin in 2005 

21   devon’s most significant conventional gas project in the rocky mountain region is the washakie field in wyoming devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field in 2004 devon added 62 producing wells in the washakie field and plans to drill another 84 wells in 2005 devon has interests in over 200000 gross acres and an inventory of more than 300 drilling locations devon’s current net production from washakie is approximately 15 mboe per day 

   devon’s gulf coast onshore properties are located in south and east texas louisiana and mississippi most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations at december 31 2004 the gulf coast accounted for approximately 12 of devon’s proved reserves 

  devon’s operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards wilcox and frio vicksburg formations devon has high working interests up to 100 in several producing fields 

  east texas is an important conventional gas producing region for devon carthage and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas wells produce from the cotton valley sands the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates devon has interests in nearly 1900 producing wells in east texas and plans to drill 106 wells in carthage and 37 wells in groesbeck in 2005 devon’s current net production from east texas is about 42 mboe per day 

   the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for 16 of devon’s 2004 production and 8 of yearend proved reserves devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the gulf of mexico and operates 450 platforms and caissons gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth the shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less the deep water is at depths beyond 600 feet devon operates in both the shelf and deepwater areas however devon expects to divest a significant number of its gulf of mexico shelf producing assets in 2005 

  in 2004 devon commenced production from two new deepwater fields red hawk garden banks 876 commenced production in july and is currently producing in excess of 120 mmcf of gas per day devon has a 50 working interest in red hawk magnolia garden banks 783 began producing oil and gas in december in february 2005 magnolia was producing about 7 mboe per day net to devon’s 25 working interest from two of an expected eight total producing wells 

  in addition to its producing properties devon has a significant inventory of exploration prospects in the gulf of mexico devon has an interest in 85 undeveloped blocks on the shelf and 526 undeveloped deepwater blocks 

  on the shallowwater shelf the industry is beginning to explore for oil and gas reserves at depths in excess of 15000 feet devon has an interest in 28 of these “deep shelf” prospects and expects to drill as many as 8 deep shelf exploratory wells during 2005 

  in the deepwater gulf of mexico almost all historical production of oil and gas has been from miocene aged reservoirs devon currently produces approximately 55 mboe per day from the deepwater gulf and has an inventory of 18 undrilled miocene prospects during 2005 devon expects to drill exploratory wells on four miocene prospects 

  in recent years the industry has begun to explore for oil below the miocene in older formations that are collectively referred to as the “lower tertiary” to date devon has participated in three lower tertiary discoveries and has an interest in 23 additional undrilled lower tertiary prospects 

  cascade walker ridge 206 was drilled in 2002 and was devon’s first discovery in the lower tertiary trend devon has a 25 working interest in the discovery and expects to drill an appraisal well on the prospect in 2005 devon’s second lower tertiary discovery was in 2003 at st malo walker ridge 678 during 2004 devon appraised the st malo discovery with a second well the st malo appraisal well encountered more than 400 net feet of oil pay devon has a 225 working interest in 

22 st malo and plans to drill a second appraisal well on the st malo prospect in 2005 in 2004 devon drilled its third lower tertiary discovery at jack walker ridge 759 the jack well encountered more than 350 net feet of oil pay devon has a 25 working interest in jack and plans to drill an appraisal well on the prospect in 2005 in addition devon plans to test at least one additional lower tertiary prospect during 2005 

   devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operates in most of the producing basins in western canada as of december 31 2004 29 of devon’s proved reserves were canadian devon’s canadian assets will be reduced by the planned 2005 noncore property divestiture program 

  many of the canadian basins where devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen consequently the winter season from december through march is the most active drilling period devon expects to drill about 400 wells in the 20042005 winter program and spend 475 million or nearly half of the full year canadian capital budget 

  the deep basin in westcentral alberta accounted for 16 of devon’s canadian proved reserves at december 31 2004 devon holds 480000 net undeveloped acres in the deep basin where it drilled 187 wells in 2004 and has another very active drilling program planned for 2005 the profitability of devon’s operations in the deep basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids producing up to 50 barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas 

  other important conventional oil and gas exploration and development areas for devon in canada include the peace river arch northeast british columbia and the central plains devon drilled 149 115 and 90 wells respectively in these areas in 2004 

  devon also drills for and produces “coldflow” heavy oil in the lloydminster area of alberta and saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1000 to 2000 feet lloydminster accounted for 12 of devon’s 2004 canadian proved reserves 

  the oil sands of eastern alberta are a vast north american hydrocarbon resource devon holds over 140000 net acres of oil sands leases in alberta in december 2004 devon received final regulatory approval to proceed with development of its jackfish oil sands project in which devon has a 100 working interest the project is expected to produce 35 mbbls per day of thermal heavy oil when fully operational in 2008 devon expects to invest 195 million at jackfish in 2005 for site preparation facilities construction and initial well drilling devon also owns interests in the surmont and dover oil sands projects which are among those expected to be divested in 2005 

   in addition to its core properties in the united states and canada devon also looks outside north america for longerterm reserve and production growth at december 31 2004 these international areas accounted for 13 of devon’s worldwide proved reserves 

  the most significant international producing property is the exxonmobiloperated zafiro oil field on block b offshore equatorial guinea in west africa during 2004 devon’s share of production from zafiro averaged 47 mbbls per day devon’s share of production from zafiro is expected to be reduced by about 20 in 2005 the expected reduction is the result of field decline and a change in devon’s share of production under the terms of the production sharing contract 

  devon will continue drilling development wells on block b in 2005 devon has also identified exploratory prospects on block b and on three additional blocks in equatorial guinea in which it has interests exploratory wells on blocks b and p are planned for 2005 

23   devon also has active offshore exploration programs in other countries in west africa and brazil devon made a discovery in 2004 offshore brazil on block bmc8 and plans followup drilling in 2005 devon also plans to drill potentially highimpact exploratory wells offshore nigeria and angola in 2005 

  devon’s second most significant international producing asset is its panyu project offshore china panyu in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea was discovered in 1998 panyu production began late in 2003 field production peaked in 2004 and averaged about 19 mbbls per day to devon’s interest during the year devon plans to drill and complete up to 10 additional development wells and test two or three exploratory prospects in the area during 2005 devon expects its net production from panyu to average about 15 mbbls per day in 2005 

  in azerbaijan devon has a 56 carried working interest in the azerichiraggunashli or acg oil development project in the caspian sea devon estimates that the acg field contains over 47 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves oil production from the acg field will increase dramatically upon completion of the bakut’bilisiceyhan pipeline which is expected in 2005 devon’s net share of acg production is expected to peak between 40000 to 50000 barrels per day in 2008 or 2009 

  devon also holds interests in cote d’ivoire gabon ghana egypt russia indonesia and syria in 2004 devon entered into several joint ventures with partners to test devon’s exploratory acreage in egypt 

title to properties 

  title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 

  as is customary in the industry other than a preliminary review of local records little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties investigations generally including a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend royalty matters 

  numerous gas producers and related parties including devon have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act the suits allege that the producers and related parties used belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel wright v chevron usa inc et al the “ wright case” the suit was originally filed in august 1996 in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas but was consolidated in october 2000 with the other suits for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming on july 10 2003 the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings trial is set for february 2007 if the suit continues to advance devon believes that it has acted reasonably has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit and has paid royalties in good faith devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith 

  devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by devon a significant portion of such production is or will be transported through facilities owned by thunder creek gas services llc of which devon owns a 75 interest devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law and devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation 

24 tax treatment of exchangeable debentures 

  as described more fully in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report devon has certain exchangeable debentures with a principal amount totaling 760 million which are exchangeable at the option of the holders into shares of chevrontexaco common stock owned by devon the debentures were assumed and the chevrontexaco common stock was acquired by devon in the 1999 pennzenergy merger 

  the internal revenue service “irs” recently examined the 1998 income tax return of pennzenergy’s predecessor and the irs formally notified devon in april 2004 that it disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998 devon did not agree with the irs positions and contested the claim of additional taxes in june 2004 devon formally protested the irs notice and requested a conference with the irs appeals office a preliminary appeals conference was held in october 2004 and additional appeals meetings were held in november and december 2004 this matter was resolved in february 2005 when the irs agreed with devon and concluded that no taxes were due 

other matters 

  devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business however to devon’s knowledge as of the date of this report there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis addresses changes in devon’s financial condition and results of operations during the threeyear period of 2002 through 2004 reference is made to “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

overview 

  according to most key financial and operating measures 2004 was the best year in devon’s history we delivered record production earnings earnings per share and cash flow from operations additionally our drilling program was very successful 

  we produced 251 million boe in 2004 representing a 10 increase over our 2003 production of 228 million boe the largest contributor to this growth was the merger with ocean in april 2003 with four additional months of production in 2004 the ocean merger generated 21 million boe of the yearoveryear growth additionally production in china began in the fourth quarter of 2003 and contributed seven million boe of 2004 growth these increases were partially offset by a decline in offshore gulf of mexico production due to the effects of hurricane ivan and natural production declines on certain other properties 

  in 2004 we also delivered the highest net earnings 22 billion and earnings per diluted share 438 in our 16 years as a public company with an increase in production and increases in average realized commodity prices devon’s oil gas and ngl revenues climbed 27 to almost 75 billion also contributing to the growth in earnings our marketing and midstream margin grew 26 to 362 million in 2004 primarily due to higher realized prices for natural gas and ngls 

  record production and revenues were partially offset by higher operating expenses in 2004 the primary factors driving the increases in expenses were increased operations due to the ocean merger increased well workover activity the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and increased production taxes the higher production taxes tracked our increase in commodity revenues although most expenses increased general and administrative expenses decreased 10 as a result of the realization of overhead and personnel efficiencies following the ocean merger 

  in addition to generating record earnings in 2004 devon also delivered record cash flow from operations at 48 billion our 2004 cash flow from operations represents a 28 increase over 2003 this alltime high amount was used to fund a 31 billion capital expenditure program 973 million of debt repayments 189 million of common stock repurchases and 107 million of dividend payments at december 31 2004 we had 21 billion of cash and shortterm investments this amount is adequate to cover debt maturities through 2007 

  furthermore on september 27 2004 devon announced two key initiatives aimed at creating additional value for its stockholders first we announced a property divestiture program the sales of noncore properties located in canada the onshore us and in the gulf of mexico are expected to generate 10 to 15 billion in aftertax proceeds closings are expected in the first half of 2005 second we announced a stock repurchase program with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the planned sales of oil and gas properties we intend to repurchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock through february 28 2005 we had repurchased 125 million shares at a total cost of 501 million 

30   in 2004 we declared a twoforone stock split and moved our stock listing to the new york stock exchange at its march 2005 meeting devon’s board of directors approved the increase of the quarterly cash dividends from 005 per share to 0075 per share the increase is effective march 31 2005 

  oil gas and ngl prices and therefore oil gas and ngl revenues are influenced by many factors outside of our control consequently devon’s management has focused its efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production and controlling costs devon’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to continue to contain our overall cost structure at a level that will allow for profitable production as a result devon has established a foundation of core assets in north america that can consistently deliver costefficient drillbit growth and provide a strong source of free cash flow we balance this foundation of core assets with measured investment in highimpact projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and international arenas 

  during 2004 devon drilled 274 exploration wells and over 1900 development wells and we incurred 29 billion in costs related to oil and gas property acquisition exploration and development activities with an overall drilling success rate of 96 reserves grew 268 million boe from discoveries and extensions another 45 million boe of reserves were added to devon’s reserve base from performance revisions these 2004 drilling results are evidence of our success in lowering the costs of adding proved reserves 

  at december 31 2004 our proved reserves totaled 21 billion boe although reserve additions due to discoveries extensions and performance revisions outpaced 2004 production reserves at december 31 2004 were relatively flat compared to december 31 2003 this resulted from negative price revisions which reduced reserves by 76 million boe 

  to estimate reserves accounting rules dictate that prices in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely as a result two primary factors caused the negative price revisions at december 31 2004 first devon’s reserves under certain international production sharing contracts are based in part on the amount of revenue needed to recover our costs therefore as prices increase as was the case for brent prices at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 our international reserves associated with production sharing contracts decrease second heavy oil differentials in canada widened to over 54 of the nymex price at december 31 2004 compared to a historical average of approximately 30 both circumstances were the primary causes of the 2004 negative price revisions 

  while devon has consistently increased production over time volatility in oil gas and ngl prices has resulted in considerable variability in earnings and cash flows prices for oil gas and ngls are determined primarily by market conditions market conditions for these products have been and will continue to be influenced by regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other factors that are beyond our control market conditions among other factors will continue to impact devon’s future earnings and cash flows 

  like all oil and gas exploration and production companies devon faces the challenge of natural production decline as virgin reservoir pressures are depleted oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases thus an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces historically we have been able to overcome this natural decline by adding through drilling and acquisitions more reserves than we produce devon’s future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 

  in summary 2004 was a successful year for devon and its stockholders and the outlook for 2005 is promising as well devon’s base of core north american resources continues to deliver strong production growth high margins and attractive returns our exploration weighted activities in the gulf of mexico and in our international division will expose stockholders to meaningful value creation opportunities devon’s financial position provides the flexibility to simultaneously invest in exploration and development projects retire debt repurchase stock and as was recently approved increase cash dividends in 2005

33   the average prices shown in the preceding tables include the effect of devon’s oil and gas price hedging activities following is a comparison of devon’s average prices with and without the effect of hedges for each of the last three years 

 

   2004 vs 2003 oil revenues increased 614 million in 2004 an increase in 2004 production of 16 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 415 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 14 million barrels of increased production the remaining increase is primarily related to new production from china partially offset by natural production declines and the effects of hurricane ivan on devon’s domestic properties oil revenues increased 199 million due to a 255 increase in the average realized price of oil 

  2003 vs 2002 oil revenues increased 679 million in 2003 an increase in 2003 production of 20 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 436 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 25 million barrels of increased production partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 5 million barrels oil revenues increased 243 million due to a 392 increase in the average price of oil 

   2004 vs 2003 gas revenues increased 835 million in 2004 a 081 per mcf increase in the average gas price caused revenues to increase by 714 million an increase in 2004 production of 28 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 121 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 43 bcf of increased production this was offset by a production decrease in devon’s domestic properties as a result of natural declines and the effects of hurricane ivan 

  2003 vs 2002 gas revenues increased 18 billion in 2003 a 171 per mcf increase in the average gas price caused revenues to increase by 15 billion an increase in 2003 production of 102 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 287 million the april 2003 ocean merger and january 2002 mitchell merger accounted for 113 bcf and 11 bcf of increased production respectively partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 36 bcf the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties 

   2004 vs 2003 ngl revenues increased 147 million in 2004 a 439 per barrel increase in average ngl prices caused revenues to increase by 106 million an increase in 2004 production of 2 million barrels caused revenues to increase 41 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 06 million barrels of increased production the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties 

  2003 vs 2002 ngl revenues increased 132 million in 2003 a 460 per barrel increase in average ngl prices caused revenues to increase by 100 million an increase in 2003 production of 3 million barrels caused revenues to increase 32 million the april 2003 ocean merger and january 2002 mitchell merger each accounted for 1 million barrels of increased production partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 1 million barrels the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties 

   2004 vs 2003 marketing and midstream revenues increased 241 million in 2004 of this increase approximately 218 million was the result of higher overall market prices for natural gas and ngls additionally revenues increased 103 million due to higher thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes this was partially offset by 80 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 

  2003 vs 2002 marketing and midstream revenues increased 461 million in 2003 of this increase approximately 439 million was the result of higher overall market prices for natural gas and ngls additionally revenues increased 22 million due to higher thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes the increase in volumes was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003 due to the timing of the january 2002 mitchell merger partially offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant dispositions 

   the details of the changes in operating costs and expenses between 2002 and 2004 are shown in the table below 

  

 36 

 

 

   2004 vs 2003 lease operating expenses increased 202 million in 2004 the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 84 million of the increase lease operating expenses on our historical properties increased 88 million due to an increase in well workover expenses ad valorem taxes and power fuel casualty insurance and repairs and maintenance costs additionally changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate resulted in a 30 million increase in costs 

  the increase in lease operating expenses per boe is primarily related to increased well workover expenses ad valorem taxes and power fuel and repairs and maintenance costs as well as the changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate with the increase in oil gas and ngl prices more well workovers and repairs and maintenance costs are performed to either maintain or improve production volumes the higher prices also resulted in increased power and fuel costs 

  production taxes increased 51 million in 2004 the majority of devon’s production taxes are assessed on our onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 22 increase in domestic oil gas and ngl revenues was the primary cause of the production tax increase 

  2003 vs 2002 lease operating expenses increased 303 million in 2003 the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 199 million of the increase lease operating expenses on our historical properties increased 120 million due to an increase in well workover expenses and power fuel casualty insurance and repairs and maintenance costs additionally changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate resulted in a 44 million increase in costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 60 million due to property divestitures in 2002 

  the increase in lease operating expenses per boe is primarily related to increased well workover expenses and power fuel and repairs and maintenance costs as well as the changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate with the increase in oil gas and ngl prices more well workovers and repairs and maintenance costs are performed to either maintain or improve production volumes the higher prices also resulted in increased power and fuel costs 

  as stated previously most us production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 79 increase in domestic oil gas and ngl revenues was the primary cause of the 93 million production tax increase 

   dda of oil and gas properties is calculated as the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year multiplied by the net capitalized investment plus future development costs in those reserves the “depletable base” generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 

  2004 vs 2003 oil and gas property related dda increased 473 million in 2004 an increase in the combined us canadian and international dda rate from 733 per boe in 2003 to 854 per boe in 2004 caused oil and gas property related dda to increase by 305 million the increase in the dda rate is primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger negative reserve revisions in canada and certain international countries subject to production sharing contracts and changes in the canadianto 

37 us dollar exchange rate a 10 increase in 2004 oil gas and ngl production caused dda to increase 168 million 

  2003 vs 2002 oil and gas property related dda increased 562 million in 2003 an increase in the combined us canadian and international dda rate from 588 per boe in 2002 to 733 per boe in 2003 caused oil and gas property related dda to increase by 331 million the increase in the dda rate is primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger higher finding and development costs and changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate a 21 increase in 2003 oil gas and ngl production caused dda to increase 231 million 

   effective january 1 2003 devon adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas no 143” using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation sfas no 143 requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets such as producing well sites offshore production platforms and natural gas processing plants the obligations included within the scope of sfas no 143 are those for which a company faces a legal obligation the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to record a separate liability at its fair value with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the related property and equipment on the balance sheet the asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment 

  because the asset retirement obligation is recorded at its discounted present value devon now records accretion expense to reflect the increase in the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time we recorded 44 million and 36 million of such accretion expense during 2004 and 2003 respectively 

   2004 vs 2003 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 165 million in 2004 of this increase approximately 133 million was the result of an increase in prices paid for gas and ngls additionally operating costs and expenses increased 106 million due to higher thirdparty natural gas and ngl throughput volumes this was partially offset by 74 million in lower costs and expenses resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 

  2003 vs 2002 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 366 million in 2003 of this increase approximately 347 million was the result of an increase in prices paid for gas and ngls an increase in thirdparty processed ngl volumes caused the remaining increase in 2003 costs and expenses the increase in volumes was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003 due to the timing of the january 2002 mitchell merger partially offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant dispositions 

   devon’s net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and development activities the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which devon serves as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes 

38 expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

   2004 vs 2003 gross ga increased 25 million the april 2003 ocean merger increased gross expenses 27 million primarily due to the inclusion of an additional four months of ocean activities in 2004 compared to 2003 also higher compensation and benefit costs increased charitable contributions and the abandonment of certain canadian office space increased gross ga 26 million 12 million and 5 million respectively during 2004 devon also incurred 6 million of incremental professional fees related to additional activities performed to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 finally changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate resulted in a 8 million increase in costs these increases were partially offset by the synergies obtained from the ocean merger 

  the increase in both capitalized ga of 32 million and reimbursed ga of 23 million was primarily related to the increased activity subsequent to the april 2003 ocean merger 

  2003 vs 2002 gross ga increased 137 million this increase was primarily related to the increased activities resulting from the april 2003 ocean merger which added 92 million of costs and increased compensation and benefit costs included in the increase of compensation and benefit costs is 14 million related to an increase in pension related costs 

  the increase in capitalized ga of 43 million was primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger reimbursed ga increased 6 million the increase in reimbursed amounts was primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger partially offset by a decline in reimbursements related to the 2002 property divestitures 

   under the full cost method of accounting the net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes may not exceed a calculated “ceiling” the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization the ceiling test is imposed separately by country 

  in calculating future net revenues current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period these prices are not changed except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts devon has entered into various derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges these instruments which consist of price swaps and costless price collars and the related future production volumes are discussed in note 12 the effect of these hedges has been considered in calculating the full cost ceiling limitations as of december 31 2004 these hedges reduced the full cost ceiling limitations for the united states canada and equatorial guinea as of the end of 2004 by 102 million 77 million and 76 million respectively however the 2004 capitalized costs in these countries did not exceed the related ceiling limitations with or without the effects of the hedges 

39   the calculation also dictates the use of a 10 discount factor the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling the excess is written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph 

  if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter 

  under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at estimated fair value as of the date of purchase we estimate such fair value using our estimates of future oil gas and ngl prices in contrast the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely accordingly the resulting value from the ceiling calculation is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves 

  an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

  during 2003 and 2002 we reduced the carrying value of our oil and gas properties by 68 million and 651 million respectively due to the full cost ceiling limitations the aftertax effects of these reductions in 2003 and 2002 were 36 million and 371 million respectively the following table summarizes these reductions by geographic area 

   the 2003 reduction in carrying value was related to properties in egypt russia and indonesia the egyptian reduction was primarily due to poor results of a development well that was unsuccessful in the primary objective partially as a result of this well devon revised egyptian proved reserves downward the russian reduction was primarily the result of additional capital costs incurred as well as an increase in operating costs the indonesian reduction was primarily related to an increase in operating costs and a reduction in proved reserves as a result our egyptian russian and indonesian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by 26 million 9 million and 1 million respectively these aftertax amounts resulted in pretax reductions of the carrying values of our egyptian russian and indonesian oil and gas properties of 45 million 19 million and 4 million respectively in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  additionally during 2003 we elected to discontinue certain exploratory activities in ghana certain properties in brazil and other smaller concessions after meeting the drilling and capital commitments on these properties we determined that these properties did not meet our internal criteria to justify further investment accordingly we recorded a 43 million charge associated with the impairment of these properties the aftertax effect of this reduction was 38 million 

  the 2002 canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower prices the recorded fair values of oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition in 2001 were based on expected future oil and gas prices these expected prices were higher than the june 30 2002 prices used to calculate the canadian ceiling 

40   based on oil natural gas and ngl cash market prices as of june 30 2002 devon’s canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by 371 million this aftertax amount resulted in a pretax reduction of the carrying value of our canadian oil and gas properties of 651 million in the second quarter of 2002 this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in canadian gas prices during the last half of june 2002 the end of june reference prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation expressed in canadian dollars based on an exchange ratio of 06585 were a nymex price of c4079 per barrel of oil and an aeco price of c217 per mmbtu the cash market prices of natural gas increased during the month of july 2002 prior to devon’s release of our second quarter results however this increase was not sufficient to offset the entire reduction calculated as of june 30 

   the details of the changes in other income expenses between 2002 and 2004 are shown in the table below 

   a discussion of the significant other income expense items follows 

   2004 vs 2003 the average debt balance outstanding decreased from 89 billion in 2003 to 85 billion in 2004 causing interest expense to decrease 21 million the decrease in average debt outstanding was due to debt repayments during 2004 the average interest rate on outstanding debt was approximately 60 in both periods however a slightly higher rate in 2004 caused interest expense to increase 3 million 

  other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 9 million lower in 2004 of this decrease 20 million related to the capitalization of interest the increase in interest capitalized was primarily related to additional unproved properties acquired from the april 2003 ocean merger and the nature of the properties acquired the ocean properties included significant deepwater gulf and international exploratory properties and major development projects the effect of the 20 million increase in capitalized interest was partially offset by 16 million of debt issuance costs expensed in 2004 the 16 million related to the early repayment of the outstanding balance under the 3 billion term loan credit facility in the second quarter of 2004 

41   2003 vs 2002 the average debt balance outstanding increased from 83 billion in 2002 to 89 billion in 2003 causing interest expense to increase 32 million the increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the debt assumed as a result of the april 2003 ocean merger the average interest rate on outstanding debt was 60 in both periods 

  other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 63 million lower in 2003 of this decrease 46 million related to the capitalization of interest 10 million related to lower net accretion and 8 million related to the loss on the early extinguishment of the 875 senior notes in 2002 the increase in interest capitalized was primarily related to additional unproved properties acquired from the april 2003 ocean merger 

   our canadian subsidiary which has designated the canadian dollar as its functional currency has certain fixedrate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar while the notes are outstanding increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes in addition devon’s canadian subsidiary has cash and other working capital amounts denominated in us dollars which also fluctuate in value with changes in the exchange rate such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt and working capital are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes the increase in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 07738 at december 31 2003 to 08308 at december 31 2004 resulted in a 22 million gain the increase in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 06331 at december 31 2002 to 07738 at december 31 2003 resulted in a 69 million gain the increase in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 06279 at december 31 2001 to 06331 at december 31 2002 resulted in a 1 million gain 

   in the fourth quarter of 2002 devon recorded a 205 million otherthantemporary impairment of our investment in 142 million shares of chevrontexaco common stock we acquired these shares in the august 1999 acquisition of pennzenergy company the shares are deposited with an exchange agent for possible exchange for 760 million of debentures that are exchangeable into the chevrontexaco shares the debentures which mature in august 2008 were also assumed by devon in the 1999 pennzenergy acquisition 

  at the closing date of the pennzenergy acquisition we initially recorded the chevrontexaco common shares at their fair value which was 4769 per share or an aggregate value of 677 million since then as the chevrontexaco shares have fluctuated in market value the value of the shares on devon’s balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable market value through september 30 2002 any decreases in the value of the chevrontexaco common shares were determined by devon to be temporary in nature therefore the changes in value were recorded directly to stockholders’ equity and were not recorded in our results of operations through september 30 2002 

  the determination that a decline in value of the chevrontexaco shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors among these factors are the significance of the decline as a percentage of the original cost and the length of time the stock price has been below original cost other factors are the performance of the stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and whether the decline is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting chevrontexaco 

  beginning in july 2002 the market value of chevrontexaco common stock began a significant decline the price per share decreased from 4425 at june 30 2002 to 3463 per share at september 30 2002 and to 3324 per share at december 31 2002 the yearend price of 3324 represented a 25 decline since june 30 2002 and a 30 decline from the original valuation in august 1999 as a result of the decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2002 devon determined that the decline was other than temporary as that term is defined by accounting rules therefore the 205 million cumulative decrease in 

42 the value of the chevrontexaco common shares from the initial acquisition in august 1999 to december 31 2002 was recorded as a noncash charge to devon’s results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 net of the applicable tax benefit the charge reduced our net earnings by 128 million 

  the share price of chevrontexaco common stock has increased to 4319 at december 31 2003 and 5251 at december 31 2004 as a result the market value of devon’s investment in chevrontexaco common stock increased 273 million from december 31 2002 to december 31 2004 the changes in the value of the shares since december 31 2002 net of applicable taxes have been recorded directly to stockholders’ equity however depending on the future performance of chevrontexaco’s common stock devon may be required to record additional noncash charges in future periods if the value of such stock declines and we determine that such declines are other than temporary 

   2004 vs 2003 other income increased 66 million in 2004 other income increased 37 million due to gains resulting from sales of certain nonoil and gas properties in 2004 interest and dividend income increased 12 million in 2004 due to an increase in cash and shortterm investment balances 

   2004 vs 2003 devon’s 2004 effective financial tax rate attributable to continuing operations was an expense of 34 compared to an expense of 23 in 2003 both the 2004 and 2003 rates benefited from canadian statutory rate reductions these rate reductions resulted in a 36 million and 218 million benefit being recorded in 2004 and 2003 respectively related to the lower tax rates being applied to deferred tax liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of the year excluding the effects of the canadian rate reductions in 2004 and 2003 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2003 the effective financial tax expense rates were 35 and 33 in 2004 and 2003 respectively the 2004 rate was equal to the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes offset by the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions the 2003 rate was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions 

  2003 vs 2002 devon’s 2003 effective financial tax rate attributable to continuing operations was an expense of 23 compared to a benefit of 144 in 2002 the 2003 rate benefited from a statutory rate reduction enacted by the canadian government excluding the effects of the 2003 canadian rate reduction the impairment of chevrontexaco stock in 2002 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2003 and 2002 the effective financial tax expense rates were 33 and 23 in 2003 and 2002 respectively these rates in both years were lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions 

   on april 18 2002 we sold our indonesian operations to petrochina company limited for total cash consideration of 250 million on october 25 2002 we sold our argentine operations to petroleo brasileiro sa for total cash consideration of 90 million on january 27 2003 we sold our egyptian operations to ipr transoil corporation for total cash consideration of 7 million 

  as a result we reclassified our indonesian argentine and egyptian activities as discontinued operations this reclassification affects not only the 2002 presentation of financial results but also the presentation of all prior periods’ results subsequent to the sale of our egyptian and indonesian operations we acquired new egyptian and indonesian assets in the april 2003 ocean merger amounts and activities related to these new egyptian and indonesian operations are included in devon’s continuing operations in both 2003 and 2004 

43   following are the components of the net results of discontinued operations for the year 2002 

 

   effective january 1 2003 we adopted sfas no 143 and recorded a cumulativeeffecttype adjustment for an increase to net earnings of 16 million net of deferred taxes of 10 million 

  in september 2004 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 106 “sab no 106” to provide guidance regarding the interaction of sfas no 143 with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties specifically sab no 106 clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and dda should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 143 we adopted sab no 106 in the fourth quarter of 2004 however this adoption did not materially impact our full cost ceiling test calculation or dda for 2004 

capital resources and liquidity 

  the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

   net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” continued to be a primary source of capital and liquidity in 2004 operating cash flow in 2004 was 48 billion compared to 38 billion in 2003 and 18 billion in 2002 the increases in operating cash flow in 2004 and 2003 were primarily caused by the increases in revenues partially offset by increased expenses as discussed in the “results of operations” section of this report 

   net cash used in investing activities was 36 billion in 2004 compared to 28 billion in 2003 and 20 billion in 2002 the increases in cash used in investing activities were directly related to increased capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as well as increases in shortterm investment balances of 626 million and 341 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

44   capital expenditures in 2004 were 31 billion this total includes 30 billion for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties these amounts compare to capital expenditures of 26 billion in 2003 and 34 billion in 2002 the 2003 amount included 25 billion for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties the 2002 amount included 17 billion related to the january 2002 mitchell merger and 16 billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and gas properties 

  the april 2003 ocean merger did not affect 2003 capital expenditures because the consideration given was devon common stock this differs from the january 2002 mitchell merger in which the consideration given was both devon common stock and cash as a result the mitchell merger did have an impact on capital expenditures paid in cash 

  proceeds from sales of property and equipment were 95 million 179 million and 14 billion in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 2002 amount includes proceeds from the sales of certain noncore oil and gas properties which were used to pay down debt 

   net cash used in financing activities during 2004 was 10 billion compared to 414 million in 2003 the increase in cash used in financing activities from 2003 to 2004 was directly related to increased debt repayments net of borrowings the increase was also related to increased common stock dividends and the repurchase of common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock net cash provided by financing activities was 401 million in 2002 consisting primarily of net proceeds from borrowings of longterm debt 

  during 2004 devon retired 973 million of debt this was primarily related to the 211 million 675 notes due february 15 2004 and the 125 million 805 notes due june 15 2004 and payment of the remaining 635 million outstanding on the 3 billion term loan credit facility during 2003 principal payments on longterm debt net of proceeds from borrowings of longterm debt were 521 million this net amount related to longterm debt assumed in the april 2003 ocean merger 

  during 2002 devon had net borrowings of 410 million these net borrowings were primarily related to the 2 billion borrowed under the 3 billion term loan credit facility to pay for the cash portion of the mitchell merger this was partially offset primarily by the repayment of 11 billion of this facility with proceeds from the 2002 property sales the early retirement of the 875 notes due june 15 2007 and certain canadian notes and the retirement of devon’s outstanding borrowings under its commercial paper and revolving credit facilities 

  devon’s common stock dividends were 97 million 39 million and 31 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we also paid 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2004 2003 and 2002 the increase in common stock dividends from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to a 100 increase in the quarterly dividend rate and the increased number of shares outstanding effective with the first quarter 2004 dividend payment devon increased its quarterly dividend rate from 0025 per share to 005 per share the increase in shares outstanding was primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger 

  in conjunction with the stock buyback program announced september 27 2004 devon repurchased 5 million shares at a total cost of 189 million during 2004 

  devon received 268 million 155 million and 32 million from shares issued for employee stock options exercised during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

   at december 31 2004 devon’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 21 billion during 2004 2003 and 2002 such balances increased 846 million 981 million and 109 million respectively 

45   historically devon’s primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow additionally we maintain a revolving line of credit and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and longterm debt over the next twelve months another major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties as announced september 27 2004 aftertax sale proceeds from the divestiture program are expected to range between 10 billion and 15 billion we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund future capital expenditures the common stock buyback program and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this section 

   devon’s operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls produced prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

  to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices devon has utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of its production additionally we have entered into various financial price swap contracts and fixedprice physical delivery contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production the table below provides the volumes associated with these various arrangements as of december 31 2004 

   in addition to the above quantities we have fixedprice physical delivery contracts covering canadian natural gas production for the years 2007 through 2011 ranging from 8 bcf to 14 bcf per year also devon has a fixedprice physical delivery contract covering 4 bcf and 3 bcf of international natural gas production in 2007 and 2008 respectively from 2012 through 2016 we have canadian natural gas volumes subject to fixedprice contracts but the yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf 

  it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers devon does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 

   another source of liquidity is our 15 billion fiveyear syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit the “senior credit facility” the senior credit facility includes i a fiveyear revolving canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of us 500 million and ii a 1 billion sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit including letters of credit under the canadian subfacility 

  the senior credit facility matures on april 8 2009 and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time unless the maturity is extended prior to each april 8 anniversary date devon has the option to extend the maturity of the senior credit facility for one year subject to the approval of the lenders devon has obtained lender approval to extend the current maturity date of april 8 2009 to april 8 2010 this maturity date extension will be effective april 8 2005 provided devon has not experienced a “material adverse effect” as defined in the senior credit facility agreement at that date 

46   amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility may at our election bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months such rates are generally less than the prime rate devon may also elect to borrow at the prime rate the senior credit facility currently provides for an annual facility fee of 19 million that is payable quarterly in arrears 

  as of december 31 2004 there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility the available capacity under the senior credit facility as of december 31 2004 net of 226 million of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 13 billion 

  the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant this covenant requires devon to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 the credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in devon’s consolidated financial statements per the agreement total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco corporation common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2004 devon’s ratio as calculated pursuant to this covenant was 330 

  our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not restricted under any “material adverse condition” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or business considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while our senior credit facility includes covenants that require devon to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect on devon the obligation of the banks to fund the senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 

  we also have access to shortterm credit under our commercial paper program total borrowings under the commercial paper program may not exceed 725 million also any borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity under the senior credit facility on a dollarfordollar basis commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven to 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days we had no commercial paper debt outstanding at december 31 2004 

   devon receives debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining our debt rating the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies 

  devon’s current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s baa2 with a stable outlook by moody’s and bbb with a stable outlook by fitch there are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level certain of devon’s agreements related to its oil and natural gas hedges do contain provisions that could require us to provide cash collateral in situations where our liability under the hedge is above a certain dollar threshold and where our debt rating is below investment grade bbb or baa3 however devon’s liability under these agreements would only exceed the threshold level in circumstances where the market prices for oil or natural gas were rising it is unlikely that our debt rating would be subjected to downgrades to noninvestment grade levels during such a period of rising oil and natural gas prices 

  devon’s cost of borrowing under our senior credit facility is predicated on its corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our senior credit facility under the terms of the senior 

47 credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase the fullydrawn borrowing costs for the senior credit facility from libor plus 70 basis points to a new rate of libor plus 875 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access future debt markets 

  as of december 31 2004 we are not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

   in february 2005 devon announced its 2005 capital expenditures budget our 2005 capital expenditures are expected to range from 30 billion to 35 billion representing the largest planned use of capital resources for capital investment activities to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control therefore if oil and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2005 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2005 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2005 we anticipate that our capital resources will be more than adequate to fund 2005 capital expenditures 

   during 2004 devon repurchased five million shares of its common stock and we intend to repurchase up to 45 million additional shares in 2005 in conjunction with a stock buyback program announced in september 2004 the shares will be repurchased with operating cash flow and proceeds from the planned sales of oil and gas properties announced on september 27 2004 the stock repurchase program may be discontinued at any time 

   a summary of devon’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 is provided in the following table 

   firm transportation agreements represent “ship or pay” arrangements whereby we have committed to ship certain volumes of oil gas and ngls for a fixed transportation fee we have entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our gas production to market devon has sufficient production to utilize the majority of these transportation services 

  devon has two offshore platform spars that are being used in the development of the nansen and boomvang fields in the gulf of mexico the operating leases are for 20year terms and contain various 

48 options whereby we may purchase the lessors’ interests in the spars we have guaranteed that the spars will have residual values at the end of the operating leases equal to at least 10 of the fair value of the spars at the inception of the leases the total guaranteed value is 20 million in 2022 however such amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease agreements 

  we also have two floating production storage and offloading facilities “fpso” that are being leased under operating lease arrangements one fpso is being used in the panyu project offshore china the other is being used in the zafiro field offshore equatorial guinea the china lease expires in september 2009 and the equatorial guinea lease expires in july 2009 

  the above table does not include 226 million of letters of credit that have been issued by commercial banks on devon’s behalf these letters of credit if funded would become borrowings under our revolving credit facility most of these letters of credit have been granted by devon’s financial institutions to support our international and canadian drilling commitments the 80 billion of longterm debt shown in the table excludes 1 million of net discounts and a 9 million fair value adjustment both of these items are included in the december 31 2004 book balance of the debt 

   devon’s pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 26 million 35 million and 16 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we estimate that our pension expense will approximate 26 million in 2005 

  as compared to the “projected benefit obligation” devon’s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 132 million and 137 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease in the underfunded amount during 2004 was primarily caused by gains on investments and 70 million of contributions made to the plans by devon these were partially offset by increases in the benefit obligations a detailed reconciliation of the 2004 activity is included in note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 132 million underfunded status at the end of 2004 109 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets however we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2004 these trusts had investments with a market value of 60 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  as compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation” our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by 11 million at december 31 2004 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels our current intentions are to provide sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated benefit obligation remains fully funded the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets required contributions also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period particularly the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2005 devon expects its contributions to the plan to be less than 10 million 

  the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions devon believes that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

  we assumed that our plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 834 and 825 at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets the target investment allocation for devon’s plan assets is 50 

49 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities 

  we believe that its longterm asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

  pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in our longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 834 to 734 would increase the expected 2005 pension expense by approximately 4 million 

  devon discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 574 at december 31 2004 compared to 623 at december 31 2003 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled this rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk we consider high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

  the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 574 to 549 would increase our pension liability at december 31 2004 by approximately 18 million and increase estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 2 million 

  at december 31 2004 devon had unrecognized actuarial losses of 155 million these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years we estimate that approximately 9 million and 8 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2005 and 2006 respectively the 9 million estimated to be recognized in 2005 is a component of the total estimated 2005 pension expense of 26 million referred to earlier in this discussion 

  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in devon’s defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

   we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization if devon’s capitalized costs are in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 

  the discounted present value of future net revenues for our proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of our reserve estimates are prepared by outside petroleum consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by devon’s engineers see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past five years annual revisions 

50 to our reserve estimates which have been both increases and decreases in individual years have averaged approximately 2 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 

  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on devon’s assessment of future prices or costs rather they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling we adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place this adjustment requires little judgment as the endofperiod price is adjusted using the contract prices for our cash flow hedges 

  the ceiling calculation also dictates that a 10 discount factor is to be used to calculate the present value of net cash flows 

  because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical on any particular day at the end of a quarter prices can be either substantially higher or lower than devon’s longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

   devon enters into oil and gas derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility we have also entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to interest rate volatility the interest rate swaps mitigate either the effects on interest expense for variablerate debt instruments or the debt fair values for fixedrate debt we are not involved in any speculative trading activities of derivatives all derivatives requiring balance sheet recognition are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 

  a substantial portion of our derivatives consists of contracts that hedge the price of future oil and natural gas production these derivative contracts are cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment therefore while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated as of the end of each reporting period the changes in the fair values attributable to the effective portion of these hedging instruments are not included in our consolidated results of operations instead the changes in fair value of the effective portion of these hedging instruments net of tax are recorded directly to stockholders’ equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced the ineffective portion of these hedging instruments is included in our consolidated results of operations 

  to qualify for hedge accounting treatment we designate our cash flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business combination which includes cash flow hedge instruments additionally we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions devon also assesses both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items if we fail to meet the requirements for using hedge accounting treatment the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to equity but in the consolidated results of operations 

51   the estimates of the fair values of devon’s commodity derivative contracts require substantial judgment for these contracts we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using libor and money market futures rates for the first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter in addition we estimate the option value of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional price differentials and interest rates fair values of devon’s other derivative contracts require less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers 

  quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal impact on our liquidity capital resources or results of operations as long as the derivative contracts qualify for treatment as a hedge however settlements of derivative contracts do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations generally if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative contracts our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments the opposite is also true additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial instruments net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

   devon has grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 

  under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 

  there are various assumptions made by devon in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 

  however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies endofperiod price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices devon’s estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when devon makes its pricing estimates 

  we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon devon’s cost of capital 

52   devon also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values 

  generally in devon’s business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that devon assumes in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if devon had issued such debt however significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies 

  except for the 2002 mitchell merger devon’s mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment this consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

  the mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that were also acquired by devon from mitchell therefore certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments we also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 

  in addition to the valuation methods described above devon performs other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid 

  in a comparable companies analysis we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with comparable financial and operating characteristics such characteristics are market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination these comparable company multiples are compared to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness 

  in a comparable transactions analysis we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently the comparable transaction multiples are compared to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness 

  in a premiums paid analysis we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to 

53 the announcement of the transaction devon uses this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compares them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

  while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on devon’s liquidity or capital resources they can have an effect on the future results of operations generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower future net earnings will be as a result of higher future depreciation depletion and amortization expense also a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop below devon’s price forecast that was used to originally determine fair value a full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources in that period however it would adversely affect our future results of operations the full cost ceiling writedown is a noncash charge as discussed in the “capital resources and liquidity” section in calculating our debttocapitalization ratio under our credit agreement total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 

  our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination as previously disclosed in our discussion of the full cost ceiling calculations during the past five years devon’s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2 as discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination the interrelationship of these estimates makes it impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of changes in these estimates 

   goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment 

  generally the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and nonoil and gas properties the lower goodwill would be a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge however unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources however it would adversely affect devon’s results of operations in that period 

  due to the interrelationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates other than to note the historical average changes in devon’s reserve estimates previously set forth 

impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 regarding stockbased employee compensation plans apb opinion no 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the stock option exercise price on the date of grant additionally sfas no 123 established fair valuebased accounting for stockbased employee compensation plans but allowed pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period also pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of sharebased payments is no longer an alternative we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r in the third quarter of 2005 and anticipate adopting sfas no 123r using the modified prospective 

54 method under this method we will recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards granted or modified on or after july 1 2005 as well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested as of july 1 2005 compensation expense will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 123r on our consolidated results of operations however we do not expect such impact to be material upon adoption in the third quarter of 2005 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp no 1092” the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” signed into law on october 22 2004 provides for a special onetime tax deduction or dividend received deduction “drd” of 85 of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company’s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the oneyear period beginning on the enactment date fsp 1092 provides entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the act for purposes of applying sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which typically requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment in the first quarter of 2005 devon’s board of directors approved the repatriation of 500 million of earnings from canadian operations which will be taxed at a reduced income tax rate caused by the drd as a result devon will recognize in the first quarter of 2005 approximately 30 million of additional current income tax expense 

sec inquiry relating to equatorial guinea 

  on august 6 2004 the sec notified devon that it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea this inquiry follows an investigation and public hearing conducted by the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments including that of equatorial guinea with riggs bank the investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of those us oil companies having interests in equatorial guinea including devon devon is cooperating with the sec inquiry 

2005 estimates 

  the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on management’s examination of historical operating trends the information which was used to prepare the december 31 2004 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties devon cautions that its future oil natural gas and ngl production revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the exploration for and development production and sale of oil gas and ngls these risks include but are not limited to price volatility inflation or lack of availability of goods and services environmental risks drilling risks regulatory changes the uncertainty inherent in estimating future oil and gas production or reserves and other risks as outlined below 

  additionally devon cautions that its future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the marketing and midstream business these risks include but are not limited to price volatility environmental risks regulatory changes the uncertainty inherent in estimating future processing volumes and pipeline throughput cost of goods and services and other risks as outlined below 

  also the financial results of our foreign operations are subject to currency exchange rate risks additional risks are discussed below in the context of line items most affected by such risks 

   prices for oil natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions market conditions for these products are influenced by regional and worldwide economic conditions weather and other local market conditions these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict in addition to volatility in general devon’s oil gas and ngl prices may vary considerably due to 

55 differences between regional markets differing quality of oil produced ie sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude differing btu contents of gas produced transportation availability and costs and demand for the various products derived from oil natural gas and ngls substantially all of devon’s revenues are attributable to sales processing and transportation of these three commodities consequently our financial results and resources are highly influenced by price volatility 

  estimates for devon’s future production of oil natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices will continue at levels that allow for profitable production of these products there can be no assurance of such stability most of our canadian production of oil natural gas and ngls is subject to government royalties that fluctuate with prices thus price fluctuations can affect reported production also our international production is governed by payout agreements with the governments of the countries in which we operate if the payout under these agreements is attained earlier than projected devon’s net production and proved reserves in such areas could be reduced 

  estimates for our future processing and transport of oil natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices will continue at levels that allow for profitable processing and transport of these products there can be no assurance of such stability 

  the production transportation processing and marketing of oil natural gas and ngls are complex processes which are subject to disruption from many causes these causes include transportation and processing availability mechanical failure human error meteorological events including but not limited to hurricanes and numerous other factors the following forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for devon’s oil natural gas and ngls during 2005 will be substantially similar to those of 2004 unless otherwise noted 

  unless otherwise noted all of the following dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2005 exchange rate of 082 us to 100 canadian the actual 2005 exchange rate may vary materially from this estimate such variations could have a material effect on the following estimates 

  though we have completed several major property acquisitions and dispositions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus the following forwardlooking data excludes the financial and operating effects of potential property acquisitions or divestitures except as discussed in “property acquisitions and divestitures” during the year 2005 the timing and ultimate results of such acquisition and divestiture activity is difficult to predict and may vary materially from that discussed in this report 

   the following estimates of production average price differentials and capital expenditures are provided separately for each of the following geographic areas 

 

   the estimates related to oil gas and ngl production operating costs and dda set forth in the following paragraphs are based on estimates for devon’s properties other than those that have been designated for possible sale see “property acquisitions and divestitures” therefore the following estimates exclude the results of the potential sale properties for the entire year 

  oil gas and ngl production set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates of devon’s oil gas and ngl production for 2005 on a combined basis devon estimates its 2005 oil gas 

56 and ngl production will total 217 mmboe of this total approximately 92 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2004 

  oil production we expect our oil production in 2005 to total 60 mmbbls of this total approximately 95 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2004 the expected production by area is as follows 

   oil prices — fixed through various price swaps devon has fixed the price it will receive in 2005 on a portion of its oil production the following table includes information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the prices have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the prices recorded by devon 

   oil prices — floating devon’s 2005 average prices for each of its areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma 

   we have also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 oil production that is otherwise subject to floating prices the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic and canadian oil production are based on the nymex price the floor and ceiling prices related to international oil production are based on the brent price if the nymex or brent price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference as long as devon meets the ongoing requirements of hedge accounting for its derivatives any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s oil revenues for the period because our oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the nymex or brent price due to differing quality ie sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude and transportation costs from different geographic areas the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 

57   the international oil prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using our estimates of 2005 differentials between nymex and the brent price upon which the collars are based 

  to simplify the presentation devon’s costless collars as of december 31 2004 have been aggregated in the following table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group 

   gas production we expect our 2005 gas production to total 804 bcf of this total approximately 90 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2004 the expected production by area is as follows 

   gas prices — fixed through various price swaps and fixedprice physical delivery contracts we have fixed the price we will receive in 2005 on a portion of our natural gas production the following table includes information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the prices have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the prices recorded by devon and the prices have also been adjusted for the btu content of the gas hedged 

   gas prices — floating for the natural gas production for which prices have not been fixed devon’s 2005 average prices for each of its areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is determined to be the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc 

   we have also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 natural gas production that otherwise is subject to floating prices if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s gas revenues for the period because our gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the 

58 related regional indices and due to differing btu contents of gas produced the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of our realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 

  the prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using our estimates of 2005 differentials between nymex and the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based the floor and ceiling prices related to the collars are based on various regional firstofthemonth price indices as published monthly by inside ferc 

  to simplify presentation devon’s costless collars have been aggregated in the following table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group 

   ngl production devon expects its 2005 production of ngls to total 23 mmbbls of this total 93 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2004 the expected production by area is as follows 

   marketing and midstream revenues and expenses devon’s marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from its natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of natural gas and ngl contract provisions and the amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated transportation and processing levels 

  these factors coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl prices increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties we estimate that 2005 marketing and midstream revenues will be between 126 billion and 140 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 100 billion and 110 billion 

  production and operating expenses devon’s production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from devon’s property base changes in production tax rates changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties and the amount of repair and workover activity required oil natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 

  given these uncertainties we estimate that 2005 lease operating expenses including transportation costs will be between 1155 billion and 1225 billion and production taxes will be between 325 and 375 of consolidated oil natural gas and ngl revenues this excludes the effect on revenues from hedges upon which production taxes are not incurred 

  depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” the 2005 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2005 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts 

59 and the revisions to devon’s yearend 2004 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2005 

  given these uncertainties oil and gas property related dda expense for 2005 is expected to be between 186 billion and 194 billion based on these dda amounts and the production estimates set forth earlier we expect our oil and gas property related dda rate will be between 860 per boe and 900 per boe 

  additionally we expect depreciation and amortization expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets to total between 150 million and 160 million 

  accretion of asset retirement obligation devon expects its 2005 accretion of its asset retirement obligation to be between 40 million and 45 million 

  general and administrative expenses “ga” ga includes the costs of many different goods and services used in support of our business these goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases in addition devon’s ga varies with its level of activity and the related staffing needs as well as with the amount of professional services required during any given period should our needs or the prices of the required goods and services differ significantly from current expectations actual ga could vary materially from the estimate 

  the planned property dispositions have further added to the uncertainties around ga estimates devon is currently in the process of determining the appropriate staffing needs subsequent to the dispositions specifically excluded from these estimates are both severance related costs and the cost savings that would result from an expected reduction of headcount any cost savings from these reductions will be dependent not only on the level of staff reductions but also on the timing as a result until this process is complete actual 2005 ga could vary materially from current estimates 

  given these limitations consolidated ga in 2005 is expected to be between 260 million and 280 million 

  reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties under the full cost method devon’s net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes the “costs to be recovered” may not exceed a calculated “full cost ceiling” the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization the ceiling is imposed separately by country in calculating future net revenues current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period these prices are not changed except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts such contracts include derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling the excess is written off as an expense an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 

  because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and on any particular day at the end of a quarter can be either substantially higher or lower than our longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

  because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict whether we will incur a full cost writedown in future periods 

  interest expense future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant effect on devon’s interest expense additionally we can only marginally influence the prices we will receive in 2005 from 

60 sales of oil natural gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future interest expense other factors which affect interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are within our control 

  the interest expense in 2005 related to our fixedrate debt including net accretion of related discounts will be approximately 430 million this fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but not all of devon’s longterm debt our floating rate debt is discussed in the following paragraphs 

  we have various debt instruments which have been converted to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps our floating rate debt is as follows 

  

   based on future libor rates as of january 31 2005 interest expense on our floating rate debt including net amortization of premiums is expected to total between 75 million and 85 million in 2005 

  devon’s interest expense totals have historically included payments of facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs the effect of interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding we expect between 5 million and 15 million of such items to be included in our 2005 interest expense also we expect to capitalize between 65 million and 75 million of interest during 2005 

  based on the information related to interest expense set forth herein and assuming no material changes in devon’s levels of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates other than the retirement of debt due to mature in 2005 we expect our 2005 interest expense will be between 445 million and 455 million 

  effects of changes in foreign currency rates our canadian subsidiary has 400 million of fixedrate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during 2005 will increase or decrease the canadian dollar equivalent balance of this debt such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes because of the variability of the exchange rate it is difficult to estimate the effect which will be recorded in 2005 however based on the december 31 2004 canadiantous dollar exchange rate of 08308 and devon’s forecast 2005 rate of 08200 we expect to record an expense of approximately 5 million the actual 2005 effect will depend on the exchange rate as of december 31 2005 

  other revenues devon’s other revenues in 2005 are expected to be between 260 million and 270 million included as part of other revenues is a 150 million gain on the sale of certain assets in the first quarter of 2005 

  our estimate of 2005 other revenues does not include the effect of any early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness of outstanding commodity price hedges as a result of the property dispositions the amount of any settlement gain or loss or hedge ineffectiveness will depend not only on the timing of the property sales but also on the forward prices in effect at that time as a result devon is unable to predict the effect that these early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness may have on its earnings under current market conditions we would expect to record a loss on these early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness 

61   income taxes our financial income tax rate in 2005 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2005 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2005’s income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced given the uncertainty of our pretax earnings amount we estimate that our consolidated financial income tax rate in 2005 will be between 25 and 45 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 20 and 30 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 5 and 15 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2005’s financial income tax rates 

  property acquisitions and divestitures though devon has completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus we do not “budget” nor can we reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions if any 

  during 2005 we contemplate the disposition of certain oil and gas properties the “disposition properties” the disposition properties are predominantly properties that are either outside of our coreoperating areas or otherwise do not fit our current strategic objectives the disposition properties are located in the us and canada at this time we expect the dispositions will occur in the first half of 2005 

  the estimates of our 2005 results previously set forth exclude any results from the disposition properties the disposition properties’ actual contributions to our 2005 operating results will depend upon the timing of the dispositions the estimated first quarter 2005 results from the disposition properties which are not included in the previous 2005 estimates in this report are as follows 

    not included in these estimates is the effect of any early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness of outstanding commodity price hedges as a result of the dispositions the amount of any settlement gain or loss or hedge ineffectiveness will depend not only on the timing of the property sales but also on the forward prices in effect at that time as a result devon is unable to predict the effect that these early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness may have on its earnings under current market conditions we would expect to record a loss on these early settlements 

   capital expenditures devon’s capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from devon’s price expectations for its future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2005 capital expenditures in 

62 addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates 

  given the limitations discussed we expect 2005 capital expenditures for drilling and development efforts plus related facilities to total between 26 billion and 30 billion these amounts include between 390 million and 450 million for drilling and facilities costs related to reserves classified as proved as of yearend 2004 in addition these amounts include between 1345 billion and 1555 billion for other production capital and between 865 million and 995 million for exploration capital other production capital includes development drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 

  the following table shows expected drilling and facilities expenditures by geographic area 

   in addition to the above expenditures for drilling and development devon expects to spend between 85 million to 95 million on its marketing and midstream assets which include its oil pipelines gas processing plants co 2 removal facilities and gas transport pipelines we also expect to capitalize between 165 million and 175 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 65 million and 75 million of interest we also expect to pay between 25 million and 30 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 70 million and 80 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets 

  other cash uses devon’s management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the current 0075 per share quarterly dividend rate and 484 million shares of common stock outstanding as of december 31 2004 dividends are expected to approximate 145 million also devon has 150 million of 649 cumulative preferred stock upon which it will pay 10 million of dividends in 2005 

  on september 27 2004 devon announced its intention to buy back up to 50 million shares of its common stock in conjunction with a stock buyback program the shares will be repurchased with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the planned property divestitures as of february 28 2005 devon has repurchased 125 million shares at a total cost of 501 million or 4004 per share 

  capital resources and liquidity devon’s estimated 2005 cash uses including its drilling and development activities and repurchase of common stock are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of working capital operating cash flow and proceeds from its planned property divestitures with the remainder if any funded with borrowings from our credit facility the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2005 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however we expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2005 as of december 31 2004 we had 21 billion of cash and shortterm investments and 13 billion available under our 15 billion of credit facilities net of 02 billion of outstanding letters of credit if significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year we could utilize our existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about devon’s potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how devon views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 

commodity price risk 

  our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us and canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 

  devon periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through various financial transactions which hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage devon’s exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 

  devon’s total hedged positions on future production as of december 31 2004 are set forth in the following tables 

   through various price swaps we have fixed the price we will receive on a portion of our oil and natural gas production in 2005 the following tables include information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the oil and gas prices related to these swaps have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the price recorded by devon and the gas price has also been adjusted for the btu content of the production that has been hedged 

oil production 

 gas production 

 

   we have also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 oil production that is otherwise subject to floating prices the floor and ceiling prices related to 

64 domestic and canadian oil production are based on the nymex price the floor and ceiling prices related to international oil production are based on the brent price if the nymex or brent price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference as long as devon meets the ongoing requirements of hedge accounting for its derivatives any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s oil revenues for the period because our oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the nymex or brent price due to differing quality ie sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude and transportation costs from different geographic areas the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 

  we have also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 natural gas production that otherwise is subject to floating prices if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s gas revenues for the period because devon’s gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the related regional indices and due to differing btu contents of gas produced the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 

  to simplify presentation our costless collars as of december 31 2004 have been aggregated in the following tables according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group 

  the international oil prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using our estimates of 2005 differentials between nymex and the brent price upon which the collars are based 

  the natural gas prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using our estimates of future differentials between nymex and the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based the floor and ceiling prices related to the collars are based on various regional firstofthemonth price indices as published monthly by inside ferc 

oil production 

 gas production 

   devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of its commodity hedging instruments at 

65 december 31 2004 a 10 increase in the underlying commodities’ prices would have increased the net liabilities recorded for our commodity hedging instruments by 115 million 

   in addition to the commodity hedging instruments described above devon also manages its exposure to oil and gas price risks by periodically entering into fixedprice contracts 

  we have fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2005 through 2011 covering canadian natural gas production ranging from 8 bcf to 14 bcf per year from 2012 through 2016 devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixedprice contracts but the yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf 

  we also have fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2005 through 2008 covering international natural gas production of 4 bcf per year except in 2008 when the volume drops to 3 bcf 

interest rate risk 

  at december 31 2004 devon had debt outstanding of 80 billion of this amount 60 billion or 75 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 70 devon also has a floatingtofixed interest rate swap in which we will record a fixed rate of 64 on a notional amount of 104 million in 2005 and 2006 and 63 on a notional amount of 32 million in 2007 

  the remaining 18 billion of debt outstanding bears interest at floating rates included in the floatingrate debt is fixedrate debt which has been converted to floatingrate debt through interest rate swaps the terms of devon’s senior credit facility allow interest rates to be fixed at our option for periods of between seven to 180 days as of december 31 2004 there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility following is a table summarizing the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps with the related debt instrument and notional amounts 

  

   devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of its interest rate swap instruments at december 31 2004 a 10 increase in the underlying interest rates would have decreased the fair value of devon’s interest rate swaps by 28 million 

  the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the shortterm maturity of such instruments 

   devon’s net assets net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 

66   our canadian subsidiary devon canada has 400 million of fixedrate longterm debt that is denominated in us dollars changes in the currency conversion rate between the canadian and us dollars between the beginning and end of a reporting period increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars required to repay the notes the amount of such increase or decrease is required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes a 10 decrease in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would cause us to record a charge of approximately 40 million in 2005 the 400 million becomes due in march 2011 until then the gains or losses caused by the exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on cash flow

 item 1 business tableend general   devon energy corporation including its subsidiaries “devon” is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration development and production the acquisition of producing properties the transportation of oil gas and ngls and the processing of natural gas through its predecessors devon began operations in 1971 as a privately held company in 1988 devon’s common stock began trading publicly on the american stock exchange under the symbol “dvn” in addition commencing on december 15 1998 a new class of devon exchangeable shares began trading on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol “nsx” these shares are essentially equivalent to devon common stock however because they are issued by devon’s wholly owned subsidiary northstar energy corporation “northstar” they qualify as a domestic canadian investment for canadian shareholders they are exchangeable at any time on a oneforone basis for common shares of devon   the principal and administrative offices of devon are located at 20 north broadway oklahoma city ok 731028260 telephone 4052353611   devon operates oil and gas properties in the united states canada and various regions located outside north america devon’s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast canadian operations are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia operations outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan china egypt and areas in west africa including equatorial guinea gabon and cote d’ivoire in addition to its oil and gas operations devon has marketing and midstream operations these include marketing natural gas crude oil and ngls and the construction and operation of pipelines storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of devon’s significant properties and associated 2003 developments can be found under “item 2 properties”   at december 31 2003 devon’s estimated proved reserves were 2089 mmboe of which 58 were natural gas reserves and 42 were oil and ngls reserves the present value of pretax future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum assuming essentially constant prices “10 present value” of such reserves was 227 billion after taxes the present value was 159 billion devon is one of the largest public independent oil and gas companies based in the united states as measured by oil and gas reserves availability of reports   devon makes available free of charge on its internet website wwwdvncom its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes them to the securities exchange commission strategy   devon’s primary objectives are to build reserves production cash flow and earnings per share by a acquiring oil and gas properties b exploring for new oil and gas reserves and c optimizing production and value from existing oil and gas properties devon’s management seeks to achieve these objectives by a concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale b acquiring and developing high profit margin properties c continually disposing of marginal and nonstrategic properties d balancing reserves between oil and gas e maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility and f enhancing the value of devon’s production and reserves through marketing and midstream activities 5 development of business   during 1988 devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion program that has continued through the subsequent years devon has used a twopronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling activities to achieve this expansion total proved reserves increased from 8 mmboe at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests to 2089 mmboe at yearend 2003   during the same time period proved reserves have grown from 131 boe per diluted share at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 965 boe per diluted share at yearend 2003 this represents a compound annual growth rate of 13 another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share production increased from 018 boe per diluted share in 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 105 boe per diluted share in 2003 a compound annual growth rate of 12   on april 25 2003 devon completed its merger with ocean energy inc “ocean” in the transaction devon issued 0414 shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of ocean common stock or a total of approximately 74 million shares also devon assumed approximately 18 billion of debt from ocean the ocean merger added approximately 554 million boe to devon’s proved reserves   cash flow from operations was 38 billion for 2003 this allowed devon to fully fund its 26 billion of capital expenditures retire over 500 million in longterm debt and add almost 1 billion to cash on hand devon is continuing to accumulate cash with the intent to repay debt as it matures in 2004 and subsequent years   devon drilled almost 300 exploration wells and over 1900 development wells during 2003 see further discussion of devon’s 2003 exploration and drilling efforts in “item 2 properties”   on january 24 2002 devon completed its merger with mitchell energy  development corp “mitchell” under the terms of this merger devon issued approximately 30 million shares of devon common stock and paid 16 billion in cash to the mitchell stockholders the cash portion of the merger was funded from borrowings under a 30 billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility the mitchell merger added approximately 404 million boe to devon’s proved reserves   on october 15 2001 devon acquired anderson exploration ltd “anderson” for approximately 35 billion in cash the anderson acquisition added approximately 534 million boe to devon’s proved reserves   to fund the cash portions of the mitchell merger and the anderson acquisition as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain longterm debt assumed from mitchell and anderson devon entered into longterm debt agreements in october 2001 that totaled 6 billion half of this total consisted of 3 billion of notes and debentures issued on october 3 2001 of this total 125 billion bears interest at 7875 and matures in september 2031 the remaining 175 billion bears interest at 6875 and matures in september 2011   the remaining 3 billion of the 6 billion of longterm debt was borrowed under a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates as of december 31 2003 24 billion of the original 3 billion balance had been retired the primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of 15 billion of debt securities of which 13 billion was used to pay down the credit facility with the remainder used to pay down other debt and 14 billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties of which 11 billion was used to pay down the credit facility as of december 31 2003 the balance outstanding under the term loan credit facility was 06 billion at an average rate of 22 the terms of this facility require repayment of the remaining debt balance at maturity in october 2006 6 financial information about segments and geographical areas   notes 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report contains information on devon’s segments and geographical areas drilling activities   devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties acquired in the future devon’s 2004 drilling activities will be focused in the rocky mountains permian basin midcontinent gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast areas in the us the western sedimentary basin of canada and in brazil china egypt russia syria and west africa outside north america   the following tables set forth the results of devon’s drilling activity for the past five years total properties  united states properties  canadian properties  7 international properties     as of december 31 2003 devon was participating in the drilling of 97 gross 6146 net wells in the us 41 gross 2936 net wells in canada and 39 gross 1253 net wells internationally of these wells through february 1 2004 43 gross 3062 net wells in the us 36 gross 2614 net wells in canada and 6 gross 223 net wells internationally had been completed as productive an additional 3 gross 120 net wells in the us and 1 gross 100 net well in canada were dry holes the remaining wells were still in process customers   devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local distribution companies existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries   the principal customers for devon’s crude oil production are refiners remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available crude oil is shipped to storage refining or pipeline facilities   no purchaser accounted for over 10 of devon’s revenues in 2003 oil and natural gas marketing   the spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in various regions of north america fluctuate in addition to fixed price contracts devon periodically enters into financial hedging arrangements or firm delivery commitments with a portion of its oil and gas production these activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage devon’s exposure to price fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”   oil marketing devon’s oil production is sold under both longterm one year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices negotiated with third parties   natural gas marketing devon’s gas production is also sold under both longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2004 approximately 78 of devon’s natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as “spot market” sales another 19 were committed under various longterm contracts one year or more which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices devon’s remaining gas production was sold under fixed price contracts 1 under shortterm agreements and 2 under longterm contracts   typically either the entire contract in the case of shortterm contracts or the price provisions of the contract in the case of longterm contracts are renegotiated from daily intervals up to oneyear 8 intervals the spot market has become progressively more competitive in recent years as a result prices on the spot market have been volatile 

competition   the oil and gas business is highly competitive devon encounters competition by major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel intense competition occurs with respect to marketing particularly of natural gas certain competitors have resources that substantially exceed those of devon seasonal nature of business   generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations government regulation   devon’s operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the united states canada and international locations in which it operates 

 

   in the united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation numerous federal state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling pipelines gas processing plants and production activities increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations devon considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of its business devon has been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies   exploration and production devon’s united states operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production devon’s operations are also subject to various conservation matters including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties in this regard some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally limit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill 9   certain of devon’s oil and gas leases including its offshore gulf of mexico leases most of its leases in the san juan basin and many of devon’s leases in southeast new mexico montana and wyoming are granted by the federal government and administered by various federal agencies including the minerals management service of the department of the interior “mms” such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” also has jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act   environmental and occupational regulations various federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect devon’s exploration development processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto these laws and regulations increase devon’s overall operating expenses devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other substances however 100 coverage is not maintained concerning any environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by devon because of its violation of any federal state or local law devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment devon’s unreimbursed expenditures in 2003 concerning such matters were immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters   devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations and the judicial construction of same devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and regulations devon considers the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of its business devon has been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies   devon maintains its own internal environmental health and safety department this department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety compliance program for devon the program includes field inspections of properties and internal assessments of devon’s compliance procedures   devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state statutes in response to liabilities associated with these activities accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are possible such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for environmental remediation and no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in devon’s consolidated financial statements devon adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information   certain of devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties “prps” under cercla or similar state legislation with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties as of december 31 2003 devon’s consolidated balance sheet included 9 million of noncurrent accrued liabilities reflected in “other liabilities” related to these and other environmental remediation liabilities 10 devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation activities with respect to the sites in which devon subsidiaries are prps devon’s conclusion is based in large part on i devon’s participation in consent decrees with both other prps and the environmental protection agency which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to the prps ii participation in groups as a de minimis prp and iii the availability of other defenses to liability as a result devon’s monetary exposure is not expected to be material 

 

   the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect devon’s canadian operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size the following are the most important areas of control and regulation   the north american free trade agreement the north american free trade agreement “nafta” which became effective on january 1 1994 carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canadaus free trade agreement in the context of energy resources canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price or iii disrupt normal channels of supply all parties to nafta are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements   exploration and production devon’s canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental regulation such regulation include requiring licenses for the drilling of wells regulating the location of wells and the method and ability to produce wells surface usage and the restoration of land upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of production from wells devon’s canadian operations are also subject to various conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of spacing units the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells and the ability to produce oil and gas in canada the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of oil and gas devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill   royalties and incentives each province and the federal government of canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure royalties production rates and taxes environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the governments of canada alberta british columbia and saskatchewan have also established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow to the producer   pricing and marketing the price of oil natural gas and ngls sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers an order from the national energy board “neb” is required for oil exports from canada any oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year in the case of light crude and two years in the case of heavy crude duration up to 25 years requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb the issue of such a license requires the approval of the government of canada natural gas exported from canada is also subject to similar regulation by the neb exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers provided that the export 11 contracts in excess of two years must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb the governments of alberta and british columbia also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability transportation arrangements and market considerations 

  environmental regulation the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local provincial and federal legislation environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations in addition legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment devon’s unreimbursed expenditures in 2003 concerning such matters were immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters   kyoto protocol in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto protocol this protocol calls for canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and 2012 the protocol will only become legally binding when it is ratified by at least 55 countries covering at least 55 percent of the emissions addressed by the protocol at this time it is uncertain if the protocol will in fact be ratified if the protocol becomes legally binding it is expected to affect the operation of all industries in canada including the oil and gas industry as details of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be announced the effect on devon cannot be determined at this time   investment canada act the investment canada act requires government of canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to be a transaction requiring such approval 

 

   the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to such legislation government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration drilling and production activities increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations the following are significant areas of regulation   exploration and production devon’s oil and gas concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government agencies such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations and orders which regulate among other matters seismic drilling and production operations on areas covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments taxes and minimum investments to the government   regulation includes requiring permits for acquiring seismic data drilling wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production devon’s operations are also subject to regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill 12   production sharing contracts many of devon’s international licenses are governed by production sharing contracts psc between the concessionaires and the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production terms and time limits of generally 30 years many pscs allow for recovery of investments including carried government percentages pscs generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions for example at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs allow governments to generally retain higher fractions of revenue   environmental regulations various government laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the environment affect devon’s exploration development processing and production operations and the costs attendant thereto in general this consists of preparing environmental impact assessments in order to receive required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition drilling or construction activities such regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response plans waste management plans environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans in some countries the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing environmental management systems are required to be implemented for international oil and gas operations employees   as of december 31 2003 devon’s staff consisted of 3924 fulltime employees devon believes that it has good labor relations with its employees

 item 2 properties tableend   substantially all of devon’s properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in devon’s core operating areas these interests entitle devon to drill for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas devon’s interests are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding royalty volumetric production payments foreign government concessions mineral and net profits interests and other forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties   devon also has certain midstream assets including natural gas and ngl processing plants and pipeline systems devon’s most significant midstream assets are its 3100 mile bridgeport pipeline system and 650 mmcf per day bridgeport gas processing plant located in north texas proved reserves and estimated future net revenue   set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were evaluated by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2003 2002 and 2001    “prepared” reserves are those estimates of quantities of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant “audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves which were estimated by devon employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant   the domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of laroche petroleum consultants ltd and ryder scott company lp in each of the years presented the canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of ajm petroleum 13 consultants in 2003 and 2002 and paddock lindstrom  associates and gilbert laustsen jung associates ltd in 2001 the international reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum consultants of ryder scott company lp in each of the years presented 

  devon follows what it believes to be a rational approach to not only recording oil and gas reserves but also to subjecting these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants the reserve estimates for all of our gulf of mexico and international properties are prepared by an independent petroleum consulting firm every year excluding 2 of devon’s 2003 international reserves that were estimated by inhouse engineers in canada another independent petroleum consulting firm prepares a rolling onethird of our properties each year so that the reserve estimates for all the canadian properties are prepared by outside engineers over a threeyear cycle   for the us onshore properties reserve estimates of individually significant properties are either prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm while estimates of minor properties are prepared by inhouse engineers this approach results in independent engineers preparing or auditing over 50 of our us onshore reserves each year   over any threeyear period more than 95 of devon’s companywide reserve estimates are prepared or audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm devon believes this approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates this is evidenced by the fact that in the past four years devon’s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2 of the previous year’s estimate   the following table sets forth devon’s estimated proved reserves and the related estimated future net revenues pretax 10 present value and aftertax standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december 31 2003 these estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the “supplemental information on oil and gas operations” in note 18 to devon’s consolidated financial statements included herein  14       no estimates of devon’s proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year except i in filings with the sec and canadian securities regulators and ii in filings with the department of energy “doe” reserve estimates filed by devon with the sec and canadian securities regulators correspond with the estimates of devon reserves contained herein reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of devon’s reserves included herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that devon does not operate   the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2003 there 15 can be no assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced 

  the process of estimating oil gas and ngls reserves is complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of among other things additional development activity production history and viability of production under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur in the future production revenue and price history   certain information concerning oil and natural gas production prices revenues net of all royalties overriding royalties and other third party interests and operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2003 is set forth in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” well statistics   the following table sets forth devon’s producing wells as of december 31 2003     devon also held numerous overriding royalty interests in oil and gas wells a portion of which are convertible to working interests after recovery of certain costs by third parties after converting to working interests these overriding royalty interests will be included in devon’s gross and net well count developed and undeveloped acreage   the following table sets forth devon’s developed and undeveloped oil and gas lease and mineral acreage as of december 31 2003  16  operation of properties   the daytoday operation of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and performs other functions the charges under operating agreements customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated   devon is the operator of 18037 of its wells as operator devon receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area in presenting its financial data devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry practice 

 

   devon’s north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions canadian operations are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia operations outside north america currently include azerbaijan brazil china egypt indonesia russia syria and areas in west africa including equatorial guinea gabon cote d’ivoire nigeria and angola maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed devon to improve operating and capital efficiency   the following table sets forth proved reserve information on the most significant geographic areas in which devon’s properties are located as of december 31 2003   17  

 

 

 

   devon’s permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas these assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths the permian basin represented 8 of devon’s proved reserves at december 31 2003   devon’s leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses more than 102000 acres of developed lands and 237000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals historically devon has been a very active operator in this area developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation   in the west texas area of the permian basin devon maintains a base of oil production with longlife reserves many of these reserves are from both operated and nonoperated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit the willard unit the reeves unit the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit these oilproducing units often exhibit low decline rates devon also owns a significant acreage position in west texas with over 194000 acres of developed lands and over 224000 acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december 31 2003 

 

   the midcontinent region includes portions of texas oklahoma and kansas these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas devon’s midcontinent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties however the barnett shale acquired in our 2002 merger with mitchell energy is a nonconventional gas resource the midcontinent region represented 19 of devon’s proved reserves at december 31 2003 approximately 76 of devon’s proved reserves in the midcontinent area are in the barnett shale   the barnett shale devon’s largest producing field is known as a tight gas formation this means that in its natural state the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas mitchell spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas the resulting technology has yielded a lowrisk and highly profitable natural gas operation devon holds 525000 net acres and nearly 1600 producing wells in the barnett shale devon’s average working interest is approximately 95   devon has experienced success extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells refractured wells often exceed their original flow rates devon is also applying horizontal drilling and closer well spacing to further enhance the value of the barnett shale   devon’s marketing and midstream operations transport and process its barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties the transport system consists of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl fractionator   in 2004 devon plans to drill a total of 192 new barnett shale wells including 94 horizontals and 98 verticals more than half of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the core development area in an 18 effort to further expand the productive area of the field the barnett shale is expected to continue to be an important producing area for devon for the foreseeable future current production from the barnett shale is approximately 428 mmcf and 24100 bbls of oil and ngls per day net 

 

   devon’s operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming montana utah and northern new mexico these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed methane projects as of december 31 2003 the rocky mountain region comprised 9 of devon’s proved reserves   approximately 38 of devon’s proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed methane devon began producing coalbed methane in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in 1998 as of december 31 2003 devon has drilled 1600 coalbed methane wells in the powder river basin devon’s net coalbed methane gas production from the basin was approximately 88 mmcf per day as of december 31 2003 and devon plans to drill 110 new wells in the powder river basin in 2004 current production in the basin is primarily from the wyodak coal formation development of the deeper big george formation could significantly expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the powder river basin the recently approved federal environmental impact statement should facilitate development of the deeper formation eightyfive of the wells planned in 2004 target these deeper coals   devon’s most significant conventional gas project in the rocky mountains region is the washakie field in wyoming devon is continuing to develop and grow production from this field in 2003 devon drilled 38 wells and plans to drill another 40 wells in 2004 devon has interests in over 200000 acres devon’s current net production from washakie is approximately 81 mmcf and 1000 bbls of oil and ngls per day 

 

   devon’s gulf coast properties are located in south and east texas louisiana and mississippi most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations at december 31 2003 the gulf coast accounted for approximately 10 of devon’s proved reserves   devon’s operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards wilcox and frio vicksburg formations devon has high working interests up to 100 in several producing fields   east texas is an important conventional gas producing region for devon carthage bethany and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas wells produce from the cotton valley sands the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates devon operates over 1300 producing wells in east texas and is currently employing a fiverig drilling and recompletion program to continue lowrisk infill development throughout the area devon’s current net production from east texas is about 187 mmcf and 8000 bbls of oil and ngls per day 

 

   the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for 17 of devon’s 2003 production and 11 of yearend proved reserves devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the gulf of mexico and operates 450 platforms and caissons the 2003 merger with ocean more than tripled devon’s gulf reserves gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth the shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less the deepwater is at depths beyond 600 feet devon has active development and drilling programs ongoing in both the shelf and deepwater areas   in the ocean merger devon acquired interests in the nansen boomvang complex in the east breaks area of the deepwater gulf of mexico devon acquired a 50 working interest in the nansen field and a 20 interest in the boomvang field ocean established oil and natural gas production at nansen boomvang in 2002 the nansen and boomvang production spars have a combined daily production 19 capacity of 80000 bbls of oil and 400 mmcf of gas devon’s share of current production from the fields is about 21000 bbls of oil and 120 mmcf of gas per day 

  ocean had two additional deepwater development projects under construction in 2003 redhawk garden banks 876 is expected to commence production in the second half of 2004 devon has a 50 working interest in redhawk and estimates net production at about 10000 boe per day magnolia garden banks 783 is expected to commence production near yearend 2004 devon has a 25 working interest in this project net production is estimated at between 9000 and 12000 boe per day   in the deepwater of the gulf of mexico devon drilled two exploratory discovery wells in 2003 the sturgis well atwater valley 182 found more than 100 net feet of oil pay sands sturgis in 3700 feet of water was the second well in devon’s fourwell joint venture with chevrontexaco upon completion of the fourth well devon will earn a 25 working interest in 71 deepwater blocks the fourth well is planned for early 2004   the second deepwater discovery in 2003 was at st malo walker ridge 678 st malo in 6900 feet of water encountered more than 450 net feet of oil pay st malo and the previously announced cascade discovery walker ridge 206 are located in the lower tertiary trend based on early evidence the lower tertiary trend may hold significant reserve potential devon plans to drill appraisal wells to better define the st malo and cascade discoveries in the first half of 2004 devon also plans to drill an appraisal well to the sturgis discovery and additional lower tertiary exploratory wells during 2004   in 2003 devon had a notable shelf discovery on its grays prospect galveston block 424 three producing wells from this discovery were brought on production in early 2004 at approximately 27 mmcf per day net to devon’s interest   the federal government is encouraging gulf of mexico operators to drill deep shelf wells wells drilled on the shelf to a depth greater than 15000 feet through a reduced royalty incentive program devon plans to drill 10 to 12 deep shelf wells in 2004 

 

   devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operates in most of the producing basins in western canada as of december 31 2003 28 of devon’s proved reserves were canadian many of the canadian basins where devon operates are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen consequently the winter season from december through march is the most active drilling period   devon expects to drill about 400 wells in the 20032004 winter program and spend 360 million or nearly half of the full year canadian capital budget the winter drilling is focused on three major areas the deep basin northeastern british columbia and the northern plains of alberta in the deep basin plans call for 106 wells compared with 71 wells last winter in northeastern bc 93 wells are planned compared with 73 the previous winter in the northern plains we expect to drill more than 100 wells this winter compared with 76 wells a year ago   the anderson acquisition in 2001 significantly strengthened devon’s holdings in the deep basin of western alberta devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the deep basin but other operators including anderson already controlled most of the acreage as a result of the anderson acquisition devon now holds over 800000 net acres in the deep basin the profitability of devon’s operations in the deep basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area devon plans to drill about 193 total wells in the deep basin in 2004 deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids producing up to 100 barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas   in 2002 devon commenced production from the first of several wells it has drilled in the grizzly valley area of the foothills region of northeastern british columbia due to gas pipeline and processing limitations initial production was limited to about 10 mmcf of gas per day however a pipeline extension completed in 2003 allowed devon to increase production from this area to about 30 mmcf per day with 20 the pipeline extension complete devon can continue to tie in additional wells in the area net production from the entire foothills region is approximately 130 mmcf of gas per day 

  devon also acquired from anderson approximately 15 million net acres in the mackenzie delta region and the shallow waters of the beaufort sea in northern canada in 2002 a devon well in the mackenzie delta encountered over 110 feet of natural gas pay production of this gas awaits an export pipeline to markets in canada and the united states various industry proposals suggest that a pipeline could be built later in the decade   devon also drills for and produces “coldflow” heavy oil in the lloydminster area of alberta and saskatchewan where oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1000 to 2000 feet in 2003 devon drilled 263 wells in the lloydminster area average net daily production from the area is approximately 34 mmcf of natural gas and 13300 bbls of crude oil   devon also owns a 13 working interest in the conocophillipsoperated surmont thermal heavy oil project surmont located north of jackfish is designed to produce up to 100000 barrels of heavy oil per day by 2012 surmont will also apply sagd recovery technology 

 

   the ocean merger more than doubled devon’s oil and gas reserves outside north america at december 31 2003 these international countries accounted for 15 of devon’s worldwide proved reserves most significant was ocean’s 24 working interest in the exxonmobiloperated zafiro field offshore equatorial guinea in west africa during 2003 production from zafiro increased significantly due to the addition of the southern expansion area sea in july production from the sea increased total field capacity to 300000 barrels of oil per day devon’s net share increased by about 15000 barrels to more than 50000 barrels per day devon’s production from zafiro is expected to decline by about 7000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2004 the decline will occur when devon reaches payout of a portion of its investment in the project and the government’s share of production increases   devon experienced another boost in international production in 2003 when its panyu project offshore china commenced production late in the year panyu in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea was discovered in 1998 in early 2004 production from the first eight of 27 planned wells reached 50000 barrels per day devon has a 245 working interest in the project and expects its share of production to average about 16000 barrels per day in 2004   in azerbaijan in the caspian sea devon has a 56 carried working interest in the azerichiraggunashli or acg oil development project devon estimates that the acg field contains over 46 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves oil production from the acg field will increase dramatically upon completion of the bakut’bilisiceyhan pipeline which is planned for 2005 devon’s net share is expected to peak at about 50000 barrels per day in 2008 or 2009   devon also acquired minor producing properties in the ocean merger in cote d’ivoire egypt indonesia and russia ocean also held exploratory blocks in angola brazil equatorial guinea nigeria and syria devon plans to drill exploratory wells in each of the aforementioned countries except cote d’ivoire and indonesia in 2004 devon also produces oil and holds exploratory blocks in gabon title to properties   title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some instances other encumbrances devon believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business   as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition other than a preliminary review of local records investigations 21 generally including a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend royalty matters   numerous gas producers and related parties including devon have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act the suits allege that the producers and related parties used belowmarket prices improper deductions improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from federal and indian owned or controlled lands the principal suit in which devon is a defendant is united states ex rel wright v chevron usa inc et al the “wright case” the suit was originally filed in august 1996 in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas but was consolidated in october 2000 with the other suits for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the district of wyoming on july 10 2003 the district of wyoming remanded the wright case back to the eastern district of texas to resume proceedings devon believes that it has acted reasonably has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the suit and has paid royalties in good faith devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith   devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation filed in wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post production costs from royalties payable by devon the plaintiffs in these lawsuits propose to expand them into county or statewide class actions relating specifically to transportation and related costs associated with devon’s wyoming gas production a significant portion of such production is or will be transported through facilities owned by thunder creek gas services llc of which devon owns a 75 interest devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable law and devon does not believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation tax treatment of exchangeable debentures   as described more fully in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report devon has certain exchangeable debentures with a principal amount totaling 760 million which are exchangeable at the option of the holders into shares of chevrontexaco common stock owned by devon the debentures were assumed and the chevrontexaco common stock was acquired by devon in the 1999 pennzenergy merger   the internal revenue service is currently examining the 1998 income tax return of pennzenergy’s predecessor in draft notices the irs has disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998 the irs has not yet formally asserted a claim for additional taxes for 1998 related to the exchangeable debentures but devon believes it is probable that such an assertion will eventually be made   based upon the draft notices received from the irs devon estimates that if the irs formally asserts a claim for additional taxes for 1998 as a result of its current examination the amount of such claim would approximate 68 million   devon does not agree with the positions that have been taken by the irs in its draft documents and will vigorously contest any claim of additional taxes although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty devon after consultation with legal counsel believes that if the irs formally asserts a claim for additional taxes regarding the treatment of the exchangeable debentures devon would likely prevail even if the irs prevailed in this matter devon believes that any related increase in its 1998 taxable income would increase its tax basis in the chevrontexaco common stock or produce a similar tax benefit and would therefore result in offsetting tax deductions in future taxable years upon the disposal of the chevrontexaco common stock therefore while the payment of any such additional taxes would 22 reduce devon’s operating cash flow in the year of payment it would not affect devon’s net earnings for any period and the operating cash flow effect would reverse in future years 

  if the irs ultimately prevailed in this matter any interest owed by devon on such additional taxes would negatively impact devon’s operating cash flow and net earnings however devon does not believe that such impact would be material to devon’s financial condition or results of operations other matters   devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business however to devon’s knowledge as of the date of this report there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend market price   devon’s common stock has been traded on the american stock exchange the “amex” since september 29 1988 prior to september 29 1988 devon’s common stock was privately held commencing on december 15 1998 a new class of devon exchangeable shares began trading on the toronto stock exchange “tse” under the symbol “nsx” these shares are essentially equivalent to devon common stock however because they are issued by devon’s wholly owned subsidiary northstar they qualify as a domestic canadian investment for canadian shareholders they are exchangeable at any time on a oneforone basis for common shares of devon at the holder’s option   the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for devon common stock and exchangeable shares as reported by the amex and tse for the periods indicated  dividends   devon commenced the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock on june 30 1993 in the amount of 003 per share effective december 31 1996 devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to 005 per share effective march 31 2004 devon increased its quarterly dividend payment to 010 per share   devon anticipates continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future dividends are also paid on the exchangeable shares at the same rate and on the same dates as dividends paid on the common stock   on february 29 2004 there were 21341 holders of record of devon common stock and 578 holders of record for the exchangeable shares 24

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis addresses changes in devon’s financial condition and results of operations during the threeyear period of 2001 through 2003 reference is made to “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” overview   on april 25 2003 devon supplemented its property portfolio and improved its growth outlook with the ocean merger former ocean shareholders received 74 million new devon common shares in exchange for their ocean shares ocean enhances our current production profile and provides outstanding prospects for growth we have substantially integrated the devon and ocean organizations and consolidated all our houston area employees at our downtown houston location   2003 was a recordbreaking year for devon we produced 228 million boe the highest annual production in its history devon’s marketing and midstream operations also contributed 286 million to operating margins total revenues for 2003 exceeded 7 billion and led to record profits and operating cash flow devon delivered the highest net earnings 17 billion and earnings per diluted share 807 in its 15 years as a public company   cash flow from operations was 38 billion for the year this allowed devon to fully fund our 26 billion of capital expenditures retire over 500 million in longterm debt and add almost 1 billion to cash on hand we are continuing to accumulate cash with the intent to repay debt as it matures in 2004 and subsequent years   the significant increase in revenues and earnings resulted from both production growth and higher commodity prices production increased 40 million boe or 21 due both to the ocean merger and the impact of devon’s exploration and development activities on a pro forma basis as if the merger had been completed on january 1 2002 devon increased production from retained properties yearoveryear by 55 average oil gas and ngl prices increased 18 61 and 33 respectively from 2002 to 2003 devon’s current price outlook assumes that over the next few years oil prices will decline toward the opec stated price range of 22 to 28 per barrel of oil from over 30 per barrel today and that natural gas prices will remain in a range of 3 to 5 per mmbtu for the foreseeable future historically the opec basket price has been approximately 2 per barrel less than the nymex price   in addition to dramatically increasing production and revenues the ocean merger increased expenses in most categories furthermore higher oil gas and ngl prices have led to upward pressure on many of devon’s expenses such as power and fuel higher oil and gas prices have also led to higher demand for oilfield supplies and services and have often caused increases in the costs of such goods and services however these same commodity price increases have also resulted in higher costs that are opportunitydriven for example with the increase in oil gas and ngl prices more well workovers and repairs and maintenance costs can be profitably performed to maintain or increase production volumes   additionally the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar caused increases in all of our canadian dollar expenses as expressed in us dollars this contributed approximately 88 million in aggregate or 039 per boe of increase in 2003 production and operating costs depreciation depletion and 27 amortization expenses and general and administrative expenses based on devon’s assumption that the average canadiantous dollar exchange rate will increase from 07160 in 2003 to 07600 in 2004 the exchange rate effect would increase these expense categories another 58 million or 023 per boe from 2003 to 2004 

  because oil gas and ngl prices are influenced by many factors outside of its control devon’s management has focused its efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production and controlling costs devon’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent on its ability to continue to contain its overall cost structure at a level that will allow for profitable production   devon drilled almost 300 exploration wells and over 1900 development wells during 2003 we incurred finding and development costs including business combinations of 79 billion in 2003 including 556 million boe of proved reserves that were acquired devon replaced 321 of annual production closing 2003 with proved reserves of 21 billion boe this resulted in perunit finding and development costs including business combinations which are higher than both devon’s historical and the industry averages management is focused on lowering our perunit finding and development costs in future years   the timing differences that often occur between the years in which capital costs are incurred and the years in which related proved reserves are booked contributed significantly to the higher perunit finding and development costs in recent years for example devon had several potential discoveries in 2003 from our exploration program we believe our deepwater gulf of mexico discoveries at st malo and sturgis and the 2002 cascade and tuk m18 discoveries will contribute significantly to devon’s proved reserves however due to the longterm nature of these projects additional testing and approval of development plans are needed before we can record the potential reserves as proved therefore we have not yet recorded any reserves related to these projects even though the costs of drilling the wells have already been included in our finding and development costs   another contributor to 2003 finding and development costs related to the development of previously booked undeveloped reserves we invested about 900 million of capital in 2003 developing reserves previously classified as proved undeveloped many of these reserves were associated with assets acquired in the ocean and other recent acquisitions this has allowed us to reduce our percentage of reserves classified as proved undeveloped from 31 following the ocean merger to 24 at yearend   as we begin recording proved reserves within the next 12 to 18 months from some of our recent discoveries and as we reduce the amount of costs incurred to develop proved undeveloped reserves we are optimistic that devon’s perunit finding and development costs will decline to more competitive levels   during 2003 devon marked its 15th anniversary as a public company while devon has consistently increased production over this 15year period volatility in oil gas and ngl prices has resulted in considerable variability in earnings and cash flows prices for oil natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by market conditions market conditions for these products have been and will continue to be influenced by regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other factors that are beyond devon’s control devon’s future earnings and cash flows will continue to depend on market conditions   like all oil and gas exploration and production companies devon faces the challenge of natural production decline as initial reservoir pressures are depleted oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases thus an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces historically devon has been able to overcome this natural decline by adding through drilling and acquisitions more reserves than it produces devon’s future growth will depend on its ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production   in summary as we head into 2004 and beyond devon is poised to continue growing organically through both our longterm investment in highimpact exploration projects and our lowerrisk development of proved undeveloped reserves in addition we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through the accumulation of cash to meet future debt maturities 28 results of operations 

 

   changes in oil gas and ngl production prices and revenues from 2001 to 2003 are shown in the following tables unless otherwise stated all dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars   29    30  nm not meaningful   the average prices shown in the preceding tables include the effect of devon’s oil and gas price hedging activities following is a comparison of devon’s average prices with and without the effect of hedges for each of the last three years  

 

   2003 vs 2002 oil revenues increased 679 million in 2003 an increase in 2003 production of 20 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 436 million the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 25 million barrels of increased production partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 5 million barrels oil revenues increased 243 million due to a 392 increase in the average price of oil   2002 vs 2001 oil revenues increased 125 million in 2002 an increase in 2002 production of 6 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 112 million the 2001 anderson acquisition and 2002 mitchell merger accounted for 11 million barrels of increased production this was partially offset by the effect of the 2002 property divestitures which reduced production by 5 million barrels a 030 per barrel increase in the average oil price in 2002 accounted for the remaining 13 million of increased oil revenues 

 

   2003 vs 2002 gas revenues increased 18 billion in 2003 a 171 per mcf increase in the average gas price caused revenues to increase by 15 billion an increase in 2003 production of 102 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 287 million the april 2003 ocean merger and january 2002 mitchell merger accounted for 113 bcf and 11 bcf of increased production respectively partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 36 bcf the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties   2002 vs 2001 gas revenues increased 255 million in 2002 an increase in production of 272 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 10 billion the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger accounted for 323 bcf of increased production this was partially offset by the effect of the 2002 property divestitures which reduced production by 30 bcf and by natural declines in production the effects of the net production increase were partially offset by a 104 per mcf decrease in the average gas price in 2002 

 

   2003 vs 2002 ngl revenues increased 132 million in 2003 a 460 per barrel increase in average ngl prices caused revenues to increase by 100 million an increase in 2003 production of 3 million barrels caused revenues to increase 32 million the april 2003 ocean merger and january 2002 mitchell merger each accounted for 1 million barrels of increased production partially offset by production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 1 million barrels the remaining production increase was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties   2002 vs 2001 ngl revenues increased 144 million in 2002 an 11 million barrel increase in 2002 production caused revenues to increase 202 million the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger accounted for 12 million barrels of increased production this was partially offset by production lost from 31 divestitures the effects of the net production increase were partially offset by a 294 per barrel decrease in the average ngl price in 2002 

 

   2003 vs 2002 marketing and midstream revenues increased 461 million in 2003 of this increase approximately 439 million was the result of an increase in gas and ngl prices an increase in thirdparty processed ngl volumes caused the remaining increase in 2003 revenues the increase in volumes was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003 due to the timing of the january 2002 mitchell merger partially offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant dispositions   2002 vs 2001 marketing and midstream revenues increased 928 million in 2002 the mitchell merger included significant marketing and midstream assets which accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenues 32 

 

   the details of the changes in operating costs and expenses between 2001 and 2003 are shown in the table below  33   

 

   2003 vs 2002 lease operating expenses increased 250 million in 2003 the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 168 million of the increase lease operating expenses on the historical devon properties increased 105 million due to an increase in well workover expenses and increased power fuel casualty insurance and repairs and maintenance costs additionally changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate resulted in a 37 million increase in costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 60 million due to the 2002 property divestitures   the increase in lease operating expenses per boe is primarily related to increased well workover expenses and increased power fuel and repairs and maintenance costs as well as the changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate with the increase in oil gas and ngl prices more well workovers and repairs and maintenance costs are performed to either maintain or improve production volumes the higher prices also resulted in increased power and fuel costs   transportation costs represent those costs paid directly to thirdparty providers to transport oil gas and ngl production sold downstream from the wellhead transportation costs increased 53 million in 2003 the april 2003 ocean merger accounted for 31 million of the increase the remainder of the increase was due primarily to an increase in gas production and 7 million of the increase was related to changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate   production taxes increased 93 million in 2003 the majority of devon’s production taxes are assessed on its onshore domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 79 increase in domestic oil gas and ngls revenues was the primary cause of the production tax increase   2002 vs 2001 lease operating expenses increased 154 million in 2002 the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger accounted for 210 million of the increase the historical devon lease operating expenses decreased 56 million primarily due to divestitures the drop in lease operating expenses per boe from 371 in 2001 to 330 in 2002 was primarily related to the lower cost properties acquired in the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger and the divestiture of some of devon’s higher cost properties   transportation costs increased 71 million in 2002 primarily due to an increase in gas production from the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger   as stated previously most of the us production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 6 decrease in domestic oil gas and ngls revenues was the primary cause of the production tax decrease 

 

   dda of oil and gas properties is calculated as the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year multiplied by the net capitalized investment plus future development costs in those reserves the “depletable base” generally if reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated separately on a countrybycountry basis 34   2003 vs 2002 oil and gas property related dda increased 562 million in 2003 an increase in the combined us canadian and international dda rate from 588 per boe in 2002 to 733 per boe in 2003 caused oil and gas property related dda to increase by 331 million the increase in the dda rate is primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger higher finding and development costs and changes in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate a 21 increase in 2003 oil gas and ngls production caused dda to increase 231 million   2002 vs 2001 oil and gas property related dda increased 313 million in 2002 a 50 increase in 2002 oil gas and ngls production caused dda to increase 394 million the effects of the production increase were partially offset by a decrease in the combined us canadian and international dda rate from 630 per boe in 2001 to 588 per boe in 2002 the drop in the dda rate was primarily due to reductions of carrying value of oil and gas properties recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2002 

 

   effective january 1 2003 devon adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas no 143” using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation sfas no 143 requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets such as producing well sites offshore production platforms and natural gas processing plants the obligations included within the scope of sfas no 143 are those for which a company faces a legal obligation the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to record a separate liability at its fair value with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the related property and equipment on the balance sheet the asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment   because the asset retirement obligation is recorded at its discounted present value devon now records accretion expense to reflect the increase in the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time devon recorded 36 million of such accretion expense during 2003 

 

   2003 vs 2002 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 366 million in 2003 of this increase approximately 347 million was the result of an increase in prices paid for gas and ngls an increase in thirdparty processed ngl volumes caused the remaining increase in 2003 costs and expenses the increase in volumes was primarily related to new drilling and development in the barnett shale properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003 due to the timing of the january 2002 mitchell merger partially offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant dispositions   2002 vs 2001 marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased 761 million in 2002 the mitchell merger included significant marketing and midstream assets which accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenues 

 

   devon’s net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting the other is the amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which devon serves as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life the gross amount of ga incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to oil gas and ngl exploration 35 and production activities as well as marketing and midstream activities see the following table for a summary of ga expenses by component 

   2003 vs 2002 gross ga increased 137 million this increase was primarily related to the increased activities resulting from the april 2003 ocean merger which added 92 million of costs and increased compensation and benefit costs included in the increase of compensation and benefit costs is 15 million related to the increase in the value of investments of deferred compensation plans which increases the obligation due to the plan participants the increase in deferred compensation costs was partially offset by an 11 million increase in other income additionally 14 million of the compensation and benefit costs related to an increase in pension related costs   the increase in capitalized ga of 43 million was primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger reimbursed ga increased 6 million the increase in reimbursed amounts was primarily related to the april 2003 ocean merger partially offset by a decline in reimbursements related to the 2002 property divestitures   2002 vs 2001 gross ga increased 139 million primarily due to the increased activities resulting from the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger also included in 2002 gross ga was 13 million related to the abandonment of certain office space assumed in the santa fe snyder merger the increase in capitalized ga of 20 million was primarily related to the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger the increase in reimbursed ga of 14 million was primarily related to the anderson acquisition and mitchell merger partially offset by a decline in reimbursements related to the 2002 property divestitures 

 

   under the full cost method of accounting the net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes and asset retirement obligations may not exceed a calculated “ceiling” the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization the ceiling test is imposed separately by country in calculating future net revenues current prices and costs are generally held constant indefinitely the effect of hedges is included in the calculation of the future net revenues the calculation also dictates the use of a 10 discount factor therefore the ceiling limitation is not necessarily indicative of the properties’ fair value the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling the excess is written off as an expense except as discussed in the following paragraph   if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter   under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at estimated fair value as of the date of purchase devon estimates such fair value using its estimates of future oil gas and ngl prices in contrast the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in 36 effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely accordingly the resulting value from the ceiling calculation is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves 

  an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period   during 2003 2002 and 2001 devon reduced the carrying value of its oil and gas properties by 68 million 651 million and 883 million respectively due to the full cost ceiling limitations the aftertax effect of these reductions in 2003 2002 and 2001 was 36 million 371 million and 533 million respectively the following table summarizes these reductions by geographic area    the 2003 reduction in carrying value was related to properties in egypt russia and indonesia the egyptian reduction was primarily due to poor results of a development well that was unsuccessful in the primary objective partially as a result of this well devon revised egyptian proved reserves downward the russian reduction was primarily the result of additional capital costs incurred as well as an increase in operating costs the indonesian reduction was primarily related to an increase in operating costs and a reduction in proved reserves as a result devon’s egyptian russian and indonesian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by 26 million 9 million and 1 million respectively these aftertax amounts resulted in pretax reductions of the carrying values of devon’s egyptian russian and indonesian oil and gas properties of 45 million 19 million and 4 million respectively in the fourth quarter of 2003   additionally during 2003 devon elected to discontinue certain exploratory activities in ghana certain properties in brazil and other smaller concessions after meeting the drilling and capital commitments on these properties devon determined that these properties did not meet devon’s internal criteria to justify further investment accordingly devon recorded a 43 million charge associated with the impairment of these properties the aftertax effect of this reduction was 38 million   the 2002 canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower prices the recorded fair values of oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition in 2001 were based on expected future oil and gas prices that were higher than the june 30 2002 prices used to calculate the canadian ceiling   based on oil natural gas and ngl cash market prices as of june 30 2002 devon’s canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by 371 million this aftertax amount resulted in a pretax reduction of the carrying value of devon’s canadian oil and gas properties of 651 million in the second quarter of 2002 this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in canadian gas prices during the last half of june 2002 the end of june reference prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation expressed in canadian dollars based on an exchange ratio of 06585 were a nymex price of c4079 per barrel of oil and an aeco price of c217 per mmbtu the cash market prices of natural gas increased during the month of july 2002 prior to devon’s release of its second quarter results but the increase was not sufficient to offset the entire reduction calculated as of june 30   the 2001 domestic and canadian reductions were also primarily the result of lower prices the oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition and other smaller acquisitions in 2001 were recorded at fair values that were based on expected future oil and gas prices higher than the december 31 2001 prices used to calculate the ceiling the yearend 2001 prices used to calculate the ceiling were based 37 on a nymex oil price of 1984 per barrel a henry hub gas price of 265 per mmbtu and an aeco gas price of c367 per mmbtu 

  additionally during 2001 devon elected to abandon operations in thailand malaysia qatar and on certain properties in brazil after meeting the drilling and capital commitments on these properties devon determined that these properties did not meet devon’s internal criteria to justify further investment accordingly devon recorded a 96 million charge associated with the impairment of these properties the aftertax effect of this reduction was 78 million 

 

   the details of the changes in other income expenses between 2001 and 2003 are shown in the table below    a discussion of the significant other income expense items follows 

 

   2003 vs 2002 interest expense decreased 31 million in 2003 an increase in the average debt balance outstanding from 83 billion in 2002 to 89 billion in 2003 caused interest expense to increase 32 million the increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the debt assumed as a result of the april 2003 ocean merger the average interest rate on outstanding debt was 60 in both periods other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 63 million lower in 2003 of this decrease 46 million related to the capitalization of interest 10 million related to lower net accretion and 8 million related to the loss on the early extinguishment of the 875 senior notes in 2002 the increase in interest capitalized was primarily related to additional unproved properties acquired from the april 2003 ocean merger and the nature of the properties acquired the ocean properties included significant deepwater gulf and international exploratory properties and major development projects   2002 vs 2001 interest expense increased 313 million in 2002 an increase in the average debt balance outstanding from 30 billion in 2001 to 83 billion in 2002 caused interest expense to increase 38 319 million the increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the longterm debt issued and assumed as a result of the mitchell merger and anderson acquisition 

  the average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased from 66 in 2001 to 60 in 2002 due to the favorable rates on the borrowings under the 3 billion term loan credit facility this facility’s rates averaged less than 3 during 2002 the overall rate decrease caused interest expense to decrease 20 million in 2002 other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were 14 million higher in 2002 of the 14 million increase in other items during 2002 5 million related to the amortization of capitalized loan costs and 3 million related to an increase in the accretion of debt discounts these increases were primarily due to the additional debt incurred as a result of the mitchell merger and anderson acquisition 

 

   devon’s canadian subsidiary has certain fixedrate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar while the notes are outstanding increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes in addition devon’s canadian subsidiary has cash and other working capital amounts denominated in us dollars which also fluctuate in value with changes in the exchange rate such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt and working capital are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes the increase in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 06331 at december 31 2002 to 07738 at december 31 2003 resulted in a 69 million gain the increase in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 06279 at december 31 2001 to 06331 at december 31 2002 resulted in a 1 million gain the drop in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate from 06419 at october 15 2001 when the debt was assumed to 06279 at december 31 2001 resulted in an 11 million loss 

 

   in the fourth quarter of 2002 devon recorded a 205 million otherthantemporary impairment of its investment in shares of chevrontexaco common stock devon acquired these shares in its august 1999 acquisition of pennzenergy company the shares are deposited with an exchange agent for possible exchange for 760 million of debentures that are exchangeable into the chevrontexaco shares the debentures which mature in august 2008 were also assumed by devon in the 1999 pennzenergy acquisition   at the closing date of the pennzenergy acquisition devon initially recorded the chevrontexaco common shares at their fair value which was 9538 per share or an aggregate value of 677 million since then as the chevrontexaco shares have fluctuated in market value the value of the shares on devon’s balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable market value through september 30 2002 any decreases in the value of the chevrontexaco common shares were determined by devon to be temporary in nature therefore the changes in value were recorded directly to stockholders’ equity and were not recorded in devon’s results of operations through september 30 2002   the determination that a decline in value of the chevrontexaco shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors among these factors are the significance of the decline as a percentage of the original cost the length of time the stock price has been below original cost the performance of the stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and whether the decline is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting chevrontexaco   beginning in july 2002 the market value of chevrontexaco common stock began a significant decline the price per share decreased from 8850 at june 30 2002 to 6925 per share at september 30 2002 and to 6648 per share at december 31 2002 the yearend price of 6648 represented a 25 decline since june 30 2002 and a 30 decline from the original valuation in august 1999 as a result of the decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2002 devon determined that the decline was other than 39 temporary as that term is defined by accounting rules therefore the 205 million cumulative decrease in the value of the chevrontexaco common shares from the initial acquisition in august 1999 to december 31 2002 was recorded as a noncash charge to devon’s results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 net of the applicable tax benefit the charge reduced net earnings by 128 million 

  during 2003 the share price of chevrontexaco common stock has increased to 8639 at december 31 2003 as a result the market value of devon’s investment in chevrontexaco common stock increased 141 million from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 the changes in the value of the shares since december 31 2002 net of applicable taxes have been recorded directly to stockholders’ equity however depending on the future performance of chevrontexaco’s common stock devon may be required to record additional noncash charges in future periods if the value of such stock declines and devon determines that such declines are other than temporary 

 

   2003 vs 2002 devon’s 2003 effective financial tax rate attributable to continuing operations was an expense of 23 compared to a benefit of 144 in 2002 the 2003 rate benefited from a statutory rate reduction enacted by the canadian government that will be phased in through 2007 this rate reduction resulted in a 218 million benefit being recorded in 2003 related to the lower tax rates being applied to deferred tax liabilities outstanding as of december 31 2002 excluding the effects of the 2003 canadian rate reduction the impairment of chevrontexaco stock in 2002 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2003 and 2002 the effective financial tax expense rates were 33 and 23 in 2003 and 2002 respectively these rates in both years were lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions   2002 vs 2001 devon’s 2002 effective financial tax rate attributable to continuing operations was a benefit of 144 compared to an effective financial tax rate expense of 18 in 2001 excluding the effects of the impairment of chevrontexaco stock in 2002 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2002 and 2001 the effective financial tax expense rates were 23 and 37 in 2002 and 2001 respectively   the 2002 rate excluding the chevrontexaco common stock impairment and the oil and gas property writedown was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions the 2001 rate excluding the oil and gas property writedowns was higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state taxes goodwill amortization that was not deductible for income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income taxes 

 

   on april 18 2002 devon sold its indonesian operations to petrochina company limited for total cash consideration of 250 million on october 25 2002 devon sold its argentine operations to petroleo brasileiro sa for total cash consideration of 90 million on january 27 2003 devon sold its egyptian operations to ipr transoil corporation for total cash consideration of 7 million   as a result devon reclassified its indonesian argentine and egyptian activities as discontinued operations this reclassification affects not only the 2002 presentation of financial results but also the presentation of all prior periods’ results subsequent to the sale of its egyptian and indonesian operations devon acquired new egyptian and indonesian assets in the april 2003 ocean merger amounts and activities related to these new egyptian and indonesian operations are included in devon’s continuing operations in 2003 40   following are the components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years 2002 and 2001  

 

   effective january 1 2003 devon adopted sfas no 143 and recorded a cumulativeeffecttype adjustment for an increase to net earnings of 16 million net of deferred taxes of 10 million   effective january 1 2001 devon adopted sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas no 133” and recorded a cumulativeeffecttype adjustment to net earnings for a 49 million gain related to the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges this gain included 46 million related to the option embedded in the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock capital expenditures capital resources and liquidity   the following discussion of capital expenditures capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

   cash payments for capital expenditures were 26 billion in 2003 this total includes 25 billion for the acquisition drilling or development of oil and gas properties these amounts compare to cash payments for capital expenditures of 34 billion in 2002 and 52 billion in 2001 the 2002 amounts included 17 billion related to the january 2002 mitchell merger and 16 billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and gas properties the 2001 amounts included 35 billion related to the october 2001 anderson acquisition and 16 billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and gas properties   the april 2003 ocean merger did not affect cash paid for 2003 capital expenditures because the consideration given was devon common stock this differs from the january 2002 mitchell merger in which the consideration given was both devon common stock and cash and the october 2001 anderson acquisition in which the consideration given was cash as a result the mitchell merger and anderson acquisition did have an impact on capital expenditures paid in cash 

 

   devon’s primary source of liquidity has historically been net cash provided by operating activities “operating cash flow” this source has been supplemented as needed by accessing credit lines and commercial paper markets and issuing equity securities and longterm debt securities in 2002 another major source of liquidity was 14 billion generated from sales of oil and gas properties 

 

   operating cash flow continued to be a primary source of capital and liquidity in 2003 operating cash flow in 2003 was 38 billion compared to 18 billion in 2002 and 19 billion in 2001 the increase in 41 operating cash flow in 2003 was primarily caused by the increase in revenues partially offset by increased expenses as discussed earlier in this section 

  devon’s operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls produced prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond devon’s control and are difficult to predict   to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices devon has utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of its production additionally devon has entered into various financial price swap contracts and fixedprice physical delivery contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production the table below provides the volumes associated with these various arrangements as of december 31 2003    in addition to the above quantities devon also has fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2006 through 2011 covering canadian natural gas production ranging from 8 bcf to 14 bcf per year from 2012 through 2016 devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixedprice contracts but the yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf   by removing the price volatility from a portion of its oil and natural gas production devon has mitigated but not eliminated the potential effects of changing prices on its operating cash flow the combination of price collars price swaps and fixedprice contracts currently in place represents approximately 65 of estimated 2004 oil production and 48 of estimated 2004 natural gas production   it is devon’s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers   in february 2004 devon announced that its capital expenditure budget for the year 2004 was approximately 28 billion this capital budget which includes capital for exploration and production marketing and midstream and other corporate items represents the largest planned use of available operating cash flow to a certain degree the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within devon’s control therefore if oil and natural gas prices decline to levels below its acceptable levels devon could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2004 capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and gas price expectations for 2004 devon anticipates that its operating cash flow will exceed its planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year devon currently intends to accumulate any excess cash to fund future years’ debt maturities additional alternatives could be considered based upon the actual amount if any of such excess cash 

 

   other sources of liquidity are devon’s revolving lines of credit devon has 1 billion of unsecured longterm credit facilities the “credit facilities” the credit facilities include a us facility of 725 million the “us facility” and a canadian facility of 275 million the “canadian facility” the 725 million us facility consists of a tranche a facility of 200 million and a tranche b facility of 525 million 42   the tranche a facility matures on october 15 2004 devon may borrow funds under the tranche b facility until june 2 2004 the “tranche b revolving period” devon may request that the tranche b revolving period be extended an additional 364 days by notifying the agent bank of such request between 30 and 60 days prior to the end of the tranche b revolving period on june 2 2004 at the end of the tranche b revolving period devon may convert the then outstanding balance under the tranche b facility to a oneyear term loan by paying the agent a fee of 25 basis points the applicable borrowing rate would be at libor plus 1125 basis points on december 31 2003 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 725 million us facility the available capacity under the us facility as of december 31 2003 net of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 586 million   devon may borrow funds under the 275 million canadian facility until june 2 2004 the “canadian facility revolving period” devon may request that the canadian facility revolving period be extended an additional 364 days by notifying the agent bank of such request between 30 and 60 days prior to the end of the canadian facility revolving period debt outstanding as of the end of the canadian facility revolving period is payable in semiannual installments of 25 each for the following five years with the final installment due five years and one day following the end of the canadian facility revolving period on december 31 2003 there were no borrowings under the 275 million canadian facility the available capacity under the canadian facility as of december 31 2003 net of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 214 million   under the terms of the credit facilities devon has the right to reallocate up to 100 million of the unused tranche b facility maximum credit amount to the canadian facility conversely devon also has the right to reallocate up to 100 million of unused canadian facility maximum credit amount to the tranche b facility   amounts borrowed under the credit facilities bear interest at various fixed rate options that devon may elect for periods up to six months such rates are generally less than the prime rate devon may also elect to borrow at the prime rate the credit facilities provide for an annual facility fee of 14 million that is payable quarterly in arrears devon intends to renew the credit facilities in 2004   devon also has access to shortterm credit under its commercial paper program total borrowings under the us facility and the commercial paper program may not exceed 725 million commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven to 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days devon had no commercial paper debt outstanding at december 31 2003   devon’s credit facilities contain only one material financial covenant this covenant requires devon to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 the credit agreements contain definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in devon’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the agreements total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments as of december 31 2003 devon was in compliance with this covenant   devon’s access to funds from its credit facilities is not restricted under any “material adverse condition” clauses it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition operations properties or prospects considered as a whole the borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement while devon’s credit facilities and its 3 billion term loan credit facility include covenants that require devon to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect on devon the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 43 

 

   in connection with the ocean merger devon assumed 18 billion of debt a summary of this debt is as follows    change of control provisions required the outstanding borrowings under the credit line and note payable to be fully paid immediately additionally devon was required to extend purchase offers for certain senior notes and the senior subordinated notes as a result of these purchase offers which expired on june 13 2003 devon paid 118 million for the aggregate principal amount tendered the purchase price for each offer was 101 percent of the principal amount of the notes tendered plus accrued and unpaid interest to and including the purchase date all notes that were not tendered remain outstanding except as described below   included in the 118 million of debt retired pursuant to the purchase offer were 13 million of the 8375 notes and 57 million of the 7875 notes the remaining 195 million of 8375 notes were called and redeemed on july 1 2003 additionally the remaining 43 million of 7875 senior notes were paid august 1 2003 when they were due 

 

   devon receives debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states in determining devon’s debt rating the agencies consider a number of items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities capital allocation challenges liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels   devon’s current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by standard  poor’s baa2 with a negative outlook by moody’s and bbb with a stable outlook by fitch there are no “rating triggers” in any of devon’s contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should devon’s debt rating fall below a specified level certain of devon’s agreements related to its oil and natural gas hedges do contain provisions that could require devon to provide cash collateral in situations where devon’s liability under the hedge is above a certain dollar threshold and where devon’s debt rating is below investment grade bbb or baa3 however devon’s liability under these agreements would only exceed the threshold level in circumstances where the market prices for oil or natural gas were rising it is 44 unlikely that devon’s debt rating would be subjected to downgrades to noninvestment grade levels during such a period of rising oil and natural gas prices 

  devon’s cost of borrowing under its credit facilities and on the 635 million borrowed under its 3 billion term loan facility is predicated on its corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact devon’s interest rate on its variable rate debt under the terms of the credit facilities and the term loan credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase devon’s fully drawn borrowing rates by 25 basis points for each facility the average borrowing costs for the credit facilities would increase from libor plus 95 basis points to libor plus 120 basis points and the borrowing costs for the term loan facility would increase from libor plus 100 basis points to libor plus 125 basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact devon’s ability to economically access future debt markets   as of december 31 2003 devon was not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 

 

   a summary of devon’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 is provided in the following table    firm transportation agreements represent “ship or pay” arrangements whereby devon has committed to ship certain volumes of gas for a fixed transportation fee devon has entered into these agreements to aid devon in moving its gas production to market devon has sufficient production to utilize the majority of these transmission services   devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003 ocean merger the spars are being used in the development of the nansen and boomvang fields in the gulf of mexico the operating leases are for 20year terms and contain various options whereby devon may purchase the lessors’ interests in the spars devon has guaranteed that the spars will have residual values at the end of the operating leases equal to at least 10 of the fair value of the spars at the inception of the leases the total guaranteed value is 20 million in 2022 however such amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease agreements   devon also has two floating production storage and offloading facilities fpso that are being leased under operating lease arrangements one fpso is being used in the panyu project offshore china and the other is being used in the zafiro field offshore equatorial guinea the china lease expires in september 2009 and the equatorial guinea lease expires in july 2011   the above table does not include 200 million of letters of credit that have been issued by commercial banks on devon’s behalf which if funded would become borrowings under devon’s revolving 45 credit facility most of these letters of credit have been granted by devon’s financial institutions to support devon’s international and canadian drilling commitments the 89 billion of longterm debt shown in the table excludes 1 million of net discounts and a 27 million fair value adjustment both of which are included in the december 31 2003 book balance of the debt 

 

   devon’s pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements devon recognized expense for its defined benefit pension plans of 35 million 16 million and 7 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively devon estimates that its pension expense will approximate 24 million in 2004   as compared to the “projected benefit obligation” devon’s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 137 million and 179 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease in the underfunded amount during 2003 was primarily caused by gains on investments and cash contributions of 67 million made to the plans by devon partially offset by increases in the benefit obligations a detailed reconciliation of the 2003 activity is included in note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the 137 million underfunded status at the end of 2003 91 million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets however devon has established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2003 these trusts had investments with a market value of 66 million the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in devon’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets   as compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation” devon’s qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 22 million at december 31 2003 the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels devon’s current intentions are to fund this accumulated benefit obligation deficit during 2004 and provide sufficient funding in subsequent years to ensure the accumulated benefit obligation remains funded the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets and any changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period   the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions devon believes that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate   devon assumed that its plan assets would generate a longterm weighted average rate of return of 825 and 827 at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively devon developed these expected longterm rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets the target investment allocation for devon’s plan assets is 50 us large cap equity securities 15 us small cap equity securities equally allocated between growth and value 15 international equity securities equally allocated between growth and value and 20 debt securities   devon believes that its longterm asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation devon regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate   pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases a decrease in devon’s longterm rate of return assumption of 100 basis points from 825 to 725 would increase the expected 2004 pension expense by approximately 4 million   devon discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of 623 at december 31 2003 compared to 672 at december 31 2002 the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled this rate is based on high 46 quality bond yields after allowing for call and default risk devon considers high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moody’s aa when selecting the discount rate 

  the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from 623 to 598 would increase devon’s pension liability at december 31 2003 by approximately 16 million and increase its estimated 2004 pension expense by approximately 2 million   at december 31 2003 devon had unrecognized actuarial losses of 119 million these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years devon estimates that approximately 7 million and 6 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2004 and 2005 respectively the 7 million estimated to be recognized in 2004 is a component of the total estimated 2004 pension expense of 24 million referred to earlier in this discussion   future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in devon’s defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities devon cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

 

   devon’s common stock dividends were 39 million 31 million and 25 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively devon also paid 10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2003 2002 and 2001   during 2001 devon repurchased 3754000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 190 million or 5071 per share devon also repurchased shares of its common stock in 2001 under an oddlot repurchase program pursuant to this program devon purchased and retired 232000 shares of its common stock for a total cost of 14 million or 5740 per share critical accounting policies 

 

   devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a “ceiling” or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet if devon’s capitalized costs are in excess of the calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which devon has oil and gas properties   devon’s discounted present value of its proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data certain of devon’s reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants while other reserve estimates are prepared by devon’s engineers see note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements   the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information in the past four years devon’s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2 of the previous year’s estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dda 47   while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on devon’s assessment of future prices or costs but rather are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling devon adjusts the endofperiod price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place   the ceiling calculation also dictates that a 10 discount factor is to be used to calculate the present value of net cash flows   because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and on any particular day at the end of a quarter can be either substantially higher or lower than devon’s longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 

 

   devon enters into oil and gas financial instruments to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility devon has also entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposures to interest rate volatility the interest rate swaps mitigate either the effects on interest expense for variablerate debt instruments or the debt fair values for fixedrate debt devon is not involved in any speculative trading activities of derivatives all derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 and are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value   a substantial portion of devon’s derivatives consists of contracts that hedge the price of future oil and natural gas production these derivative contracts are cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 133 therefore while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated as of the end of each reporting period the changes in the fair values are not included in devon’s consolidated results of operations instead the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments net of tax are recorded directly to stockholders’ equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced to qualify for hedge accounting treatment devon designates its cash flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business combination which includes cash flow hedge instruments additionally devon documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions devon also assesses both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items if devon fails to meet the requirements for using hedge accounting treatment the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to equity but in the consolidated results of operations   the estimates of the fair values of devon’s commodity derivative contracts require substantial judgment for these contracts devon obtains forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using devon’s current borrowing rates under its revolving credit facilities in addition devon estimates the option value of price floors and price caps using the blackscholes option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional price differentials and interest rates fair 48 values of devon’s other derivative contracts require less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers 

 

   devon has grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method   under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually   there are various assumptions made by devon in determining the fair values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities the most significant assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values of these properties devon prepares estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves these estimates are based on work performed by devon’s engineers and that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation   however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full cost ceiling calculation applies current price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on devon’s estimates of future oil natural gas and ngl prices devon’s estimates of future prices are based on its own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when devon makes its pricing estimates   devon estimates future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired and estimates future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon devon’s cost of capital   devon also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination these unproved properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what devon considers to be an appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what devon considers to be the appropriate fair values   generally in devon’s business combinations the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have longterm debt that devon assumes in the acquisition and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if devon had issued such debt however significant judgment on devon’s behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by devon’s peer companies   except for the 2002 mitchell merger devon’s mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration development and production activities 49 related to oil and gas properties however in addition to exploration development and production activities mitchell’s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment which consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 

  because the mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that were also acquired by devon from mitchell certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the midstream assets for example future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on historical costs and known trends and commitments devon also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at devon’s estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment   in addition to the valuation methods described above devon performs other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in any business combination these analyses include information related to comparable companies comparable transactions and premiums paid   in a comparable company analysis devon reviews the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics such as market capitalization location of proved reserves and the characterization of those reserves that devon deems to be similar to those of the party to the proposed business combination these comparable company multiples are compared to the proposed business combination company multiples for reasonableness   in a comparable transactions analysis devon reviews certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently the comparable transaction multiples are compared to the proposed business combination transaction multiples for reasonableness   in a premiums paid analysis devon uses a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently to review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction devon uses this information to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compares them to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness 

 

   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually this requires devon to estimate the fair values of its own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination therefore considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 

 

   in 2003 the securities exchange commission “sec” inquired of the financial accounting standards board regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 141 business combinations “sfas no 141” and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas no 142” to oil and gas companies sfas nos 141 and 142 became effective for transactions subsequent to june 30 2001 sfas no 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that acquired intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately 50 from goodwill specifically the sec’s inquiry is based on whether costs of contractbased drilling and mineral use rights “mineral rights” should be recorded and disclosed as intangible assets under the guidance in sfas nos 141 and 142 the current practice for devon and the industry is to present oil and gas related assets including mineral rights as property and equipment tangible assets on the balance sheet since june 30 2001 devon has entered into business combinations with anderson mitchell and ocean with an aggregate accounting purchase price of 182 billion the majority of the purchase price has been allocated to oil and gas property 

  an emerging issues task force working group “eitf” has been created to research the accounting and disclosure treatment of mineral rights for oil and gas companies as a result the eitf has added issue no 03o “whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets” and issue no 03s “application of fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets to oil and gas companies” currently devon does not believe that generally accepted accounting principles require the classification of mineral rights as intangible assets and continues to classify these assets as oil and gas properties however the decisions of the eitf may affect how devon classifies these assets in the future if the eitf ultimately determines that sfas nos 141 and 142 require oil and gas companies to classify mineral rights as separate intangible assets the amounts included in oil and gas properties on the balance sheet that would be reclassified are not expected to exceed the following amounts    amounts to be reclassified would be impacted by the provisions of the eitf consensus the ultimate reclassification amount could be materially different than the amounts above as numerous decisions that could be included in the consensus would impact the composition and amortization of the intangible assets if any   devon believes that cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would likely continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with devon’s accounting policies as prescribed under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties further devon does not believe the classification of the mineral rights as intangible assets would affect compliance with covenants under its debt agreements 

 

   in december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46r” which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity fin 46r replaces fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities which was issued in january 2003 devon will be required to apply fin 46r to variable interests in variable interest entities “vies” created after december 31 2003 for variable interests in vies created before january 1 2004 fin 46r will be applied beginning on january 1 2005 for any vies that must be consolidated under fin 46r that were created before january 1 2004 the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the consolidated balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable fair value at the date fin 46r first applies may be used to measure the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie devon owns no interests in variable interest entities therefore fin 46r will not affect devon’s consolidated financial statements 51   sfas statement no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity “sfas no 150” was issued in may 2003 sfas no 150 establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope sfas no 150 was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise will be effective as of january 1 2004 except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments sfas no 150 will be effective on january 1 2005 the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments devon currently does not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of sfas no 150 2004 estimates   the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on management’s examination of historical operating trends the information which was used to prepare the december 31 2003 reserve reports and other data in devon’s possession or available from third parties devon cautions that its future oil natural gas and ngl production revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the exploration for and development production and sale of oil gas and ngls these risks include but are not limited to price volatility inflation or lack of availability of goods and services environmental risks drilling risks regulatory changes the uncertainty inherent in estimating future oil and gas production or reserves and other risks as outlined below   additionally devon cautions that its future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the marketing and midstream business these risks include but are not limited to price volatility environmental risks regulatory changes the uncertainty inherent in estimating future processing volumes and pipeline throughput cost of goods and services and other risks as outlined below   also the financial results of devon’s foreign operations are subject to currency exchange rate risks additional risks are discussed below in the context of line items most affected by such risks 

 

   prices for oil natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions market conditions for these products are influenced by regional and worldwide economic conditions weather and other local market conditions these factors are beyond devon’s control and are difficult to predict in addition to volatility in general devon’s oil gas and ngl prices may vary considerably due to differences between regional markets transportation availability and costs and demand for the various products derived from oil natural gas and ngls substantially all of devon’s revenues are attributable to sales processing and transportation of these three commodities consequently devon’s financial results and resources are highly influenced by price volatility   estimates for devon’s future production of oil natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil gas and ngls will continue at levels that allow for profitable production of these products there can be no assurance of such stability also devon’s international production of oil natural gas and ngls is governed by payout agreements with the governments of the countries in which devon operates if the payout under these agreements is attained earlier than projected devon’s net production and proved reserves in such areas could be reduced   estimates for devon’s future processing and transport of oil natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil gas and ngls will continue at levels that allow for profitable processing and transport of these products there can be no assurance of such stability   the production transportation processing and marketing of oil natural gas and ngls are complex processes which are subject to disruption due to transportation and processing availability mechanical failure human error meteorological events including but not limited to hurricanes and numerous other 52 factors the following forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for devon’s oil natural gas and ngls during 2004 will be substantially similar to those of 2003 unless otherwise noted 

  unless otherwise noted all of the following dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using a projected average 2004 exchange rate of 07600 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar the actual 2004 exchange rate may vary materially from this estimate such variations could have a material effect on the following estimates   though devon has completed several major property acquisitions and dispositions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus the following forwardlooking data excludes the financial and operating effects of potential property acquisitions or divestitures during the year 2004 geographic reporting areas for 2004   the following estimates of production average price differentials and capital expenditures are provided separately for each of the following geographic areas  year 2004 potential operating items   oil gas and ngl production set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates of devon’s oil gas and ngl production for 2004 on a combined basis devon estimates its 2004 oil gas and ngl production will total between 256 and 261 mmboe of this total approximately 95 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2003   oil production devon expects its oil production in 2004 to total between 78 and 80 mmbbls of this total approximately 97 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2003 the expected ranges of production by area are as follows    oil prices — fixed through various price swaps devon has fixed the price it will receive in 2004 on a portion of its oil production the following table includes information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the prices have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the prices recorded by devon  53   oil prices — floating devon’s 2004 average prices for each of its areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing oklahoma    devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2004 oil production that is otherwise subject to floating prices the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic and canadian oil production are based on the nymex price the floor and ceiling prices related to international oil production are based on the brent price if the nymex or brent price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s oil revenues for the period because devon’s oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the nymex or brent price due to differing quality ie sweet crude versus sour crude and transportation costs from different geographic areas the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars   the international oil prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using devon’s estimates of 2004 differentials between nymex and the brent price upon which the collars are based   to simplify presentation devon’s costless collars as of december 31 2003 have been aggregated in the following table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group  54   gas production devon expects its 2004 gas production to total between 936 bcf and 948 bcf of this total approximately 93 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2003 the expected ranges of production by area are as follows    gas prices — fixed through various price swaps and fixedprice physical delivery contracts devon has fixed the price it will receive in 2004 on a portion of its natural gas production the following table includes information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the prices have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the prices recorded by devon and the prices have also been adjusted for the btu content of the gas hedged    gas prices — floating for the natural gas production for which prices have not been fixed devon’s 2004 average prices for each of its areas are expected to differ from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is determined to be the firstofmonth south louisiana henry hub price index as published monthly in inside ferc    devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2004 natural gas production that otherwise is subject to floating prices if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s gas revenues for the period because devon’s gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the related regional indices and due to differing btu contents of gas produced the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars   the prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using devon’s estimates of 2004 differentials between nymex and the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based the floor and ceiling prices related to the domestic collars are based on various regional firstofthemonth price indices as published monthly by inside ferc the floor and ceiling prices related to the canadian collars are based on the aeco index as published by the canadian gas price reporter 55   to simplify presentation devon’s costless collars have been aggregated in the following table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group    in the april 2003 ocean merger devon assumed an obligation under a forward sale contract to deliver contractual quantities of 55600 mmbtu per day in 2004 under the terms of this forward sale the purchaser is obligated to make additional payments in the event the spot price exceeds 300 per mmbtu in 2004 the spot price is based on a relevant regional firstofthemonth price index as published monthly by inside ferc as determined by devon as part of the purchase price allocation devon recorded deferred revenues related to this forward gas sale based on the 300 price these deferred revenues will be recognized during 2004 if the monthly spot prices exceed these prices devon will receive additional cash payments from the purchaser which will also be recorded as gas revenues therefore if the monthly spot prices for 2004 exceed 300 per mmbtu devon will recognize gas revenues on the related quantities at a floating market price but will receive actual cash payments equal only to the difference between the floating market price and 300 if the monthly spot prices for 2004 are equal to or less than 300 per mmbtu devon will recognize gas revenues on the related quantities at a fixed price of 300 and will receive no cash consideration for the delivered quantities of gas 56   ngl production devon expects its 2004 production of ngls to total between 22 mmbbls and 23 mmbbls of this total 95 is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at december 31 2003 the expected ranges of production by area are as follows    marketing and midstream revenues and expenses devon’s marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from its natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and relative prices of natural gas and ngls provisions of the contract arrangements and the amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels   these factors coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl prices increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses given these uncertainties devon estimates that 2004 marketing and midstream revenues will be between 107 billion and 114 billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between 860 million and 910 million   production and operating expenses devon’s production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from devon’s property base changes in production tax rates changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties and the amount of repair and workover activity required oil natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects   given these uncertainties devon estimates that 2004 lease operating expenses will be between 105 billion and 112 billion transportation costs will be between 220 million and 230 million and production taxes will be between 31 and 36 of consolidated oil natural gas and ngl revenues excluding revenues related to hedges upon which production taxes are not incurred   depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” the 2004 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2004 compared to the costs incurred for such efforts and the revisions to devon’s yearend 2003 reserve estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2004   given these uncertainties oil and gas property related dda expense for 2004 is expected to be between 22 billion and 23 billion additionally devon expects its dda expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets to total between 120 million and 130 million based on these dda amounts and the production estimates set forth earlier devon expects its consolidated dda rate will be between 900 per boe and 930 per boe   accretion of asset retirement obligation as a result of the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations devon expects its 2004 accretion of its asset retirement obligation to be between 40 million and 45 million   general and administrative expenses “ga” devon’s ga includes the costs of many different goods and services used in support of its business these goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases in addition devon’s ga varies with its level of activity and the related staffing needs as well as with the amount of professional services required during any given period should devon’s needs or the prices of the required goods and services differ significantly from current expectations actual ga could vary materially from the estimate given these limitations consolidated ga in 2004 is expected to be between 305 million and 325 million 57   this estimate does not include the potential noncash effect on ga caused by changes in the value of investments of deferred compensation plans positive returns from these investments increase devon’s ga while negative returns decrease ga   reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties under the full cost method devon’s net book value of oil and gas properties less related deferred income taxes and asset retirement obligations the “costs to be recovered” may not exceed a calculated “full cost ceiling” the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization the ceiling is imposed separately by country in calculating future net revenues current prices and costs are generally held constant indefinitely the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling the excess is written off as an expense an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period   because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and on any particular day at the end of a quarter can be either substantially higher or lower than devon’s longterm price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves   because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to predict whether devon will incur a full cost writedown in future periods   interest expense future interest rates debt outstanding and oil natural gas and ngl prices have a significant effect on devon’s interest expense devon can only marginally influence the prices it will receive in 2004 from sales of oil natural gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future interest expense other factors which affect interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are within devon’s control   the interest expense in 2004 related to devon’s fixedrate debt including net accretion of related discounts will be approximately 475 million this fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but not all of devon’s longterm debt devon’s floating rate debt is discussed in the following paragraphs   devon has a 5year term loan facility due in 2006 that bears interest at floating rates devon also has various debt instruments which have been converted to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps devon’s floating rate debt is as follows    based on devon’s interest rate projections interest expense on its floating rate debt including net amortization of premiums is expected to total between 45 million and 55 million in 2004   devon’s interest expense totals have historically included payments of facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs the effect of interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding devon expects between 15 million and 58 20 million of such items to be included in its 2004 interest expense also devon expects to capitalize between 25 million and 30 million of interest during 2004 

  based on the information related to interest expense set forth herein and assuming no material changes in devon’s levels of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates devon expects its 2004 interest expense will be between 510 million and 520 million   effects of changes in foreign currency rates devon’s canadian subsidiary has 400 million of fixedrate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during 2004 will increase or decrease the canadian dollar equivalent balance of this debt such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes because of the variability of the exchange rate it is difficult to estimate the effect which will be recorded in 2004 however based on the december 31 2003 canadiantous dollar exchange rate of 07738 and devon’s forecast 2004 rate of 07600 devon expects to record an expense of approximately 7 million the actual 2004 effect will depend on the exchange rate as of december 31 2004   other revenues devon’s other revenues in 2004 are expected to be between 30 million and 35 million   income taxes devon’s financial income tax rate in 2004 will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2004 will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on 2004’s income tax expense regardless of the level of pretax earnings that are produced given the uncertainty of its pretax earnings amount devon estimates that its consolidated financial income tax rate in 2004 will be between 25 and 45 the current income tax rate is expected to be between 20 and 30 the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 5 and 15 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2004’s financial income tax rates year 2004 potential capital sources uses and liquidity   capital expenditures though devon has completed several major property acquisitions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus devon does not “budget” nor can it reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions if any   devon’s capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions should actual prices received differ materially from devon’s price expectations for its future production some projects may be accelerated or deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2004 capital expenditures in addition if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could vary materially from devon’s estimates   given the limitations discussed devon expects its 2004 capital expenditures for drilling and development efforts plus related facilities to total between 214 billion and 254 billion these amounts include between 510 million and 550 million for drilling and facilities costs related to reserves classified as proved as of yearend 2003 in addition these amounts include between 950 million and 12 billion for other low riskreward projects and between 680 million and 760 million for new higher riskreward projects low riskreward projects include development drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation higher riskreward projects include exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 59   the following table shows expected drilling and facilities expenditures by geographic area    in addition to the above expenditures for drilling and development devon expects to spend between 90 million to 100 million on its marketing and midstream assets which include its oil pipelines gas processing plants co 2 removal facilities and gas transport pipelines devon also expects to capitalize between 160 million and 170 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to capitalize between 25 million and 30 million of interest devon also expects to pay between 40 million and 45 million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 90 million and 100 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets   other cash uses devon’s management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue with the february 2004 increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 010 per share and 239 million shares of common stock outstanding in february 2004 dividends are expected to approximate 96 million also devon has 150 million of 649 cumulative preferred stock upon which it will pay 10 million of dividends in 2004   capital resources and liquidity devon’s estimated 2004 cash uses including its drilling and development activities are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of working capital and operating cash flow with the remainder if any funded with borrowings from devon’s credit facilities the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2004 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited however devon expects its combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund its anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for 2004 as of december 31 2003 devon has 800 million available under its 1 billion of credit facilities net of 200 million of outstanding letters of credit if significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year devon could utilize its existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   the primary objective of the following information is to provide forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about devon’s potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how devon views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures all of devon’s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading commodity price risk   devon’s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil gas and ngl production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to its us and canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 60   devon periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through various financial transactions which hedge the future prices received these transactions include financial price swaps whereby devon will receive a fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage devon’s exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations devon does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes   devon’s total hedged positions on future production as of december 31 2003 are set forth in the following tables 

 

   through various price swaps devon has fixed the price it will receive on a portion of its oil and natural gas production in 2004 through 2005 the following tables include information on this fixedprice production by area where necessary the gas prices related to these swaps have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the price recorded by devon and the price has also been adjusted for the btu content of the gas production that has been hedged oil production   gas production   

 

   devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2004 and 2005 oil production that otherwise are subject to floating prices the floor and ceiling prices 61 related to domestic and canadian oil production are based on the nymex price the floor and ceiling prices related to international oil production are based on the brent price if the nymex or brent price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s oil revenues for the period because devon’s oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the nymex or brent price due to differing quality ie sweet crude versus sour crude and transportation costs from different geographic areas the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 

  devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2004 and 2005 natural gas production that otherwise is subject to floating prices if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon’s gas revenues for the period because devon’s gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the related regional indices and due to differing btu contents of gas produced the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon’s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars   to simplify presentation devon’s costless collars as of december 31 2003 have been aggregated in the following tables according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices the floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages of the various collars in each aggregated group   the international oil prices shown in the following tables have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using devon’s estimates of future differentials between nymex and the brent price upon which the collars are based   the natural gas prices shown in the following tables have been adjusted to a nymexbased price using devon’s estimates of future differentials between nymex and the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based the floor and ceiling prices related to the domestic collars are based on various regional firstofthemonth price indices as published monthly by inside ferc the floor and ceiling prices related to the canadian collars are based on the aeco index as published by the canadian gas price reporter oil production  62  gas production   63   devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of its commodity hedging instruments at december 31 2003 a 10 increase in the underlying commodities’ prices would have increased the net liabilities recorded for devon’s commodity hedging instruments by 253 million 

 

   in addition to the commodity hedging instruments described above devon also manages its exposure to oil and gas price risks by periodically entering into fixedprice contracts   devon has fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2004 through 2011 covering canadian natural gas production ranging from 8 bcf to 16 bcf per year from 2012 through 2016 devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixedprice contracts but the yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf interest rate risk   at december 31 2003 devon had debt outstanding of 89 billion of this amount 69 billion or 77 bears interest at fixed rates averaging 70 devon also has a floatingtofixed interest rate swap in which devon will record a fixed rate of 64 on a notional amount of 97 million in 2003 through 2006 and 63 on a notional amount of 30 million in 2007   the remaining 20 billion of debt outstanding bears interest at floating rates included in the floatingrate debt is debt with floating rates and fixedrate debt which has been converted to floatingrate debt through interest rate swaps the terms of devon’s various floatingrate debt facilities revolving credit facilities and termloan credit facility allow interest rates to be fixed at devon’s option for periods of between seven to 180 days a 10 increase in shortterm interest rates on the floatingrate debt facilities outstanding as of december 31 2003 would equal approximately 22 basis points such an increase in interest rates would increase devon’s 2004 interest expense by approximately 1 million assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding for all of 2004 following is a table summarizing the fixedtofloating interest rate swaps with the related debt instrument and notional amounts    devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of its interest rate swap instruments at december 31 2003 a 10 increase in the underlying interest rates would have decreased the fair value of devon’s interest rate swaps by 8 million   the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the shortterm maturity of such instruments foreign currency risk   devon’s net assets net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period   devon’s canadian subsidiary devon canada has 400 million of fixedrate longterm debt that is denominated in us dollars changes in the currency conversion rate between the canadian and 64 us dollars between the beginning and end of a reporting period increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars required to repay the notes the amount of such increase or decrease is required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes a 10 decrease in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would cause devon to record a charge of approximately 40 million in 2004 the 400 million becomes due in march 2011 until then the gains or losses caused by the exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on cash flow

include azerbaijan brazil china and west africa in addition to its oil and
gas operations devon has a large marketing and midstream business this
includes marketing natural gas crude oil and ngls marketing and midstream also
includes the construction and operation of pipelines storage and treating
facilities and gas processing plants a detailed description of devons
significant properties and associated 2002 developments can be found under item
2 properties beginning on page 13 hereof

     at december 31 2002 devons estimated proved reserves were 1609 mmboe
of which 60 were natural gas reserves and 40 were oil and ngls reserves the
present value of pretax future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum
assuming essentially constant prices 10 present value of such reserves was
153 billion after taxes the present value was 104 billion devon is one of
the top five public independent oil and gas companies based in the united
states as measured by oil and gas reserves

strategy

     devons primary objectives are to build reserves production cash flow and
earnings per share by a acquiring oil and gas properties b exploring for
new oil and gas reserves and c optimizing production and value from existing
oil and gas properties devons management seeks to achieve these objectives by
a concentrating its properties in core areas to achieve economies of scale
b acquiring and developing high profit margin properties c continually
disposing of marginal and nonstrategic properties d balancing reserves
between oil and gas e maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility and
f enhancing the value of devons production through marketing and midstream
activities

     during 1988 devon expanded its capital base with its first issuance of
common stock to the public this transaction began a substantial expansion
program that has continued through the subsequent years devon has used a
twopronged strategy of acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling
activities to achieve this expansion total proved reserves increased from 8
mmboe at yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers
accounted for as poolings of interests to 1609 mmboe at yearend 2002

     devons objective however is to increase value per share not simply to
increase total assets proved reserves have grown from 131 boe per share at
yearend 1987 without giving effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 1003 boe
per share at yearend 2002 this represents a compound annual growth rate of
145 another measure of value per share is oil and gas production per share
production increased from 018 boe per share in 1987 without giving effect to
the 1998 and 2000 poolings to 117 boe per share in 2002 a compound annual
growth rate of 133

development of business

     on february 24 2003 devon and ocean energy inc ocean announced their
intention to merge in the transaction devon will issue 0414 of a share of its
common stock for each outstanding share of ocean common stock also devon will
assume approximately 18 billion of debt from ocean the transaction is subject
to approval by the stockholders of both companies as well as certain regulatory
approvals if approved the transaction is expected to be consummated shortly
after the stockholder meetings

     on january 24 2002 devon completed its acquisition of mitchell energy 
development corp mitchell under the terms of this merger devon issued
approximately 30 million shares of devon common stock and paid 16 billion in
cash to the mitchell stockholders the cash portion of the acquisition was
funded from borrowings under a 30 billion senior unsecured term loan credit
facility the mitchell merger added approximately 404 million boe to devons
proved reserves

     following the mitchell merger announcement in august 2001 devon announced
on september 4 2001 that it had entered into an agreement to acquire anderson
exploration ltd anderson for approximately 35 billion in cash this
acquisition closed on october 15 2001 and therefore had an impact on devons
results for the last two and onehalf months of 2001 the anderson acquisition
added approximately 534 million boe to devons proved reserves

     to fund the cash portions of these two acquisitions as well as to pay
related transaction costs and retire certain longterm debt assumed from
mitchell and anderson devon entered into longterm debt agreements in october
2001 that totaled 6 billion half of this total consisted of 3 billion of
notes and debentures issued on october 3 2001 of this total 125 billion
bears interest at 7875 and matures in september 2031 the remaining 175
billion bears interest at 6875 and matures in september 2011

     the remaining 3 billion of the 6 billion of longterm debt is in the form
of a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates as of december 31
2002 19 billion of the original 3 billion balance had been retired the
primary sources of the repayments were the 2002 issuance of 1 billion of debt
securities of which 08 billion was used to pay down debt and 14 billion
from the sale of certain oil and gas properties of which 11 billion was used
to pay down debt as of december 31 2002 the balance outstanding under the
term loan credit facility was 11 billion at an average rate of 25 principal
payments due on this debt are 03 billion in april 2006 and 08 billion in
october 2006

     during 2002 devon disposed of approximately 14 billion of properties
also in 2002 devon spent 15 billion in its exploration and drilling efforts

1 gross wells are the sum of all wells in which devon owns an interest

2 net wells are the sum of devons working interests in gross wells

     as of december 31 2002 devon was participating in the drilling of 76
gross 6071 net wells in the us 49 gross 2893 net wells in canada and 8
gross 089 net wells internationally of these wells through february 15
2003 51 gross 4091 net wells in the us and 42 gross 2507 net wells in
canada had been completed as productive an additional 1 gross 30 net well in
the us 1 gross 50 net well in canada and 1 gross 050 net well
internationally were dry holes the remaining wells were still in process

customers

     devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers including
pipelines utilities gas marketing firms industrial users and local
distribution companies existing gathering systems and interstate and intrastate
pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and deliveries

     the principal customers for devons crude oil production are refiners
remarketers and other companies some of which have pipeline facilities near the
producing properties in the event pipeline facilities are not conveniently
available crude oil is trucked or barged to storage refining or pipeline
facilities

     no purchaser accounted for over 10 of devons revenues in 2002

oil and natural gas marketing

     oil marketing  devons oil production is sold under both longterm one
year or more and shortterm less than one year agreements at prices
negotiated with third parties

     natural gas marketing  devons gas production is also sold under both
longterm and shortterm agreements at prices negotiated with third parties
although exact percentages vary daily as of february 2003 approximately 75 of
devons natural gas production was sold under shortterm contracts at variable
or marketsensitive prices these marketsensitive sales are referred to as
spot market sales another 22 were committed under various longterm
contracts one year or more which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for
an extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices devons
remaining gas production was sold under fixed price contracts 2 under
shortterm agreements and 1 under longterm contracts

     under both longterm and shortterm contracts typically either the entire
contract in the case of shortterm contracts or the price provisions of the
contract in the case of longterm contracts are renegotiated from daily
intervals up to oneyear intervals the spot market has become progressively
more competitive in recent years as a result prices on the spot market have
been volatile

     the spot market is subject to volatility as supply and demand factors in
various regions of north america fluctuate in addition to fixed price
contracts devon periodically enters into hedging arrangements or firm delivery
commitments with a portion of its gas production these activities are intended
to support targeted gas price levels and to manage the companys exposure to gas
price fluctuations see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk

competition

     the oil and gas business is highly competitive devon encounters
competition by major integrated and independent oil and gas companies in
acquiring drilling prospects and properties contracting for drilling equipment
and securing trained personnel intense competition occurs with respect to
marketing particularly of natural gas certain competitors have resources that
substantially exceed those of devon

seasonal nature of business

     generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the
summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as
mild winters sometimes lessen this fluctuation in addition pipelines
utilities local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas
storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements
during the summer this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations

government regulation

     devons operations are subject to various levels of government controls and
regulations in the united states canada and internationally

  united states regulation

     in the united states legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has
been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant
to such legislation numerous federal state and local departments and agencies
have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry
and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for
failure to comply such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil
and gas drilling gas processing plants and production activities increase the
cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability inasmuch as new
legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws
and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted devon is unable to
predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations
devon considers the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable
part of its business devon has been able to plan for and comply with new
environmental initiatives without materially altering its operating strategies

     exploration and production  devons united states operations are subject
to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels such
regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells maintaining
bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells implementing spill
prevention plans submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the
presence use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas
operations and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and
casing wells the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and
materials used in connection with drilling and production activities surface
usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled the
plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production devons
operations are also subject to various conservation matters including the
regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the
number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling
of oil and gas properties in this regard some states allow the forced pooling
or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on
voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to
develop oil and gas properties in addition state conservation laws establish
maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally limit the venting
or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable
purchase of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts
of oil and gas devon can produce from its wells and to limit the number of wells
or the locations at which devon can drill

     certain of devons oil and gas leases including its offshore gulf of
mexico leases most of its leases in the san juan basin and many of devons
leases in southeast new mexico and wyoming are granted by the federal
government and administered by various federal agencies including the minerals
management service of the department of the interior mms such leases
require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate
among other matters drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases
and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government
the mms has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and in some
cases promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease
bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands the
federal energy regulatory commission ferc also has jurisdiction over certain
offshore activities pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act

     environmental and occupational regulations  various federal state and
local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials into
the environment the generation storage transportation and disposal of
contaminants or otherwise relating to the protection of public health natural
resources wildlife and the environment affect devons exploration
development processing and production operations and the costs attendant
thereto these laws and regulations increase devons overall operating expenses
devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit its
financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting
from sudden unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil salt water or other
substances however 100 coverage is not maintained concerning any
environmental claim and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty
or fine required to be paid by devon because of its violation of any federal
state or local law devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to
protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates making increased
expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the
increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment
devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2002 concerning such matters were
immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its
future exposure concerning such matters

     devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational
safety and health due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations
and the judicial construction of same devon is unable to predict with any
reasonable degree of certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and
regulations devon considers the cost of safety and health compliance a
necessary and manageable part of its business devon has been able to plan for
and comply with new initiatives without materially altering its operating
strategies

     devon maintains its own internal environmental health and safety
department this department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an
environmental and safety compliance program for devon the program includes
field inspections of properties and internal assessments of devons compliance
procedures

     devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental
remediation activities associated with past operations such as the
comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla
and similar state statutes in response to liabilities associated with these
activities accruals have been established when reasonable estimates are
possible such accruals primarily include estimated costs associated with
remediation devon has not used discounting in determining its accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation and no material claims for possible
recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental
costs have been recognized in devons consolidated financial statements devon
adjusts the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
probable costs become estimable or when current remediation estimates must be
adjusted to reflect new information

     certain of devons subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are involved in
matters in which it has been alleged that such subsidiaries are potentially
responsible parties prps under cercla or similar state legislation with
respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated by third parties as
of december 31 2002 devons consolidated balance sheet included 8 million of
noncurrent accrued liabilities reflected in other liabilities related to
these and other environmental remediation liabilities devon does not currently
believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs
in excess of the current accruals recognized for such environmental remediation
activities with respect to the sites in which devon subsidiaries are prps
devons conclusion is based in large part on i devons participation in
consent decrees with both other prps and the environmental protection agency
which provide for performing the scope of work required for remediation and
contain covenants not to sue as protection to the prps ii participation in
groups as a de minimis prp and iii the availability of other defenses to
liability as a result devons monetary exposure is not expected to be
material

  canadian regulations

     the oil and gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and
regulations imposed by various levels of government it is not expected that any
of these controls or regulations will affect devons canadian operations in a
manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies
of similar size the following are the most important areas of control and
regulation

     the north american free trade agreement  the north american free trade
agreement nafta which became effective on january 1 1994 carries forward
most of the material energy terms contained in the canadaus free trade
agreement in the context of energy resources canada continues to remain free
to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed
provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy
exported relative to the supply of the energy resource ii impose an export
price higher than the domestic price or iii disrupt normal channels of
supply all parties to nafta are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or
import price requirements

     royalties and incentives  each province and the federal government of
canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure royalties
production rates and taxes environmental protection and other matters under
their respective jurisdictions the royalty regime is a significant factor in
the profitability of oil and natural gas production royalties payable on
production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations
between the parties crown royalties are determined by government regulation and
are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production
with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices well
productivity geographical location field discovery date and the type and
quality of the petroleum product produced from time to time the governments of
canada alberta and british columbia have also established incentive programs
such as royalty rate reductions royalty holidays and tax credits for the
purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery
projects these incentives generally have the effect of increasing the cash flow
to the producer

     pricing and marketing  the price of oil and natural gas sold is determined
by negotiation between buyers and sellers an order from the national energy
board neb is required for oil exports from canada any oil export to be made
pursuant to an export contract of longer than one year in the case of light
crude and two years in the case of heavy crude duration up to 25 years
requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb the issue of such
a license requires the approval of the government of canada natural gas
exported from canada is also subject to similar regulation by the neb exporters
are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers provided that the
export contracts in excess of two years must continue to meet certain criteria
prescribed by the neb the governments of alberta and british columbia also
regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for
consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability
transportation arrangements and market considerations

     environmental regulation  the oil and natural gas industry is subject to
environmental regulation pursuant to local provincial and federal legislation
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases
or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with
certain oil and gas industry operations in addition legislation requires that
well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of
provincial authorities a breach of such legislation may result in the
imposition of fines and penalties devon is committed to meeting its
responsibilities to protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates
making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result
of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the
environment devons unreimbursed expenditures in 2002 concerning such matters
were immaterial but devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree of
certainty its future exposure concerning such matters

     kyoto protocol  in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the
kyoto protocol this protocol calls for canada to reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels during the period between 2008 and
2012 the protocol will only become legally binding when it is ratified by at
least 55 countries covering at least 55 percent of the emissions addressed by
the protocol if the protocol
                                        11
page

becomes legally binding it is expected to affect the operation of all
industries in canada including the oil and gas industry as details of the
implementation of this protocol have yet to be announced the effect on devon
cannot be determined at this time

     investment canada act  the investment canada act requires government of
canada approval in certain cases of the acquisition of control of a canadian
business by an entity that is not controlled by canadians in certain
circumstances the acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered
to be a transaction requiring such approval

  international regulations

     the oil and gas industry is subject to various types of regulation
throughout the world legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been
pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion pursuant to
such legislation government agencies have issued extensive rules and
regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members some
of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply such laws and
regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling and production
activities increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect
profitability inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is
commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or
reinterpreted devon is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying
with such laws and regulations the following are significant areas of
regulation

     exploration and production  devons oil and gas concessions and permits
are granted by host governments and administered by various foreign government
agencies such foreign governments require compliance with detailed regulations
and orders which regulate among other matters drilling and operations on areas
covered by concessions and permits and calculation and disbursement of royalty
payments taxes and minimum investments to the government

     regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells
maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells
implementing spill prevention plans submitting notification and receiving
permits relating to the presence use and release of certain materials
incidental to oil and gas operations and regulating the location of wells the
method of drilling and casing wells the use transportation storage and
disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production
activities surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells
have been drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of
production devons operations are also subject to regulations which may limit
the number of wells or the locations at which devon can drill

     production sharing contracts  many of devons international licenses are
governed by production sharing contracts psc between the concessionaires and
the granting government agency pscs are contracts that define and regulate the
framework for investments revenue sharing and taxation of mineral interests in
foreign countries unlike most domestic leases pscs have defined production
terms and time limits of generally 30 years many pscs allow for recovery of
investments including carried government percentages pscs generally contain
sliding scale revenue sharing provisions for example at either higher
production rates or higher cumulative rates of return pscs allow governments to
generally retain higher fractions of revenue

     environmental regulations  various government laws and regulations
concerning the discharge of incidental materials into the environment the
generation storage transportation and disposal of contaminants or otherwise
relating to the protection of public health natural resources wildlife and the
environment affect devons exploration development processing and production
operations and the costs attendant thereto in general this consists of
preparing environmental impact assessments in order to receive required
environmental permits to conduct drilling or construction activities such
regulations also typically include requirements to develop emergency response
plans waste management plans and spill contingency plans in some countries
the application of worldwide standards such as iso 14000 governing
environmental management systems are required to be implemented for
international oil and gas operations

employees

     as of december 31 2002 devons staff consisted of 3436 fulltime
employees devon believes that it has good labor relations with its employees









item 2  properties

     substantially all of devons properties consist of interests in developed
and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage located in devons core
operating areas and midstream assets these interests entitle devon to drill
for and produce oil natural gas and ngls from specific areas devons interests
are mostly in the form of working interests and to a lesser extent overriding
royalty volumetric production payments foreign government concessions mineral

2 estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue to be
    generated from the production of proved reserves net of estimated
    production and development costs the amounts shown do not give effect to
    nonproperty related expenses such as general and administrative expenses
    not related directly to oil and gas producing debt service and future
    income tax expense or to depreciation depletion and amortization

    these amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect as of
    december 31 2002 these prices were not changed except where different
    prices were fixed and determinable from applicable contracts these
    assumptions yield average prices over the life of devons properties of
    2799 per bbl of oil 388 per mcf of natural gas and 1707 per bbl of
    ngls these prices compare to december 31 2002 new york mercantile

    this report

     no estimates of devons proved reserves have been filed with or included in
reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the
beginning of the last fiscal year except i in filings with the sec and
canadian securities regulators and ii in filings with the department of energy
doe reserve estimates filed by devon with the sec and canadian securities
regulators correspond with the estimates of devon reserves contained herein
reserve estimates filed with the doe are based upon the same underlying
technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of devons reserves included
herein however the doe requires reports to include the interests of all owners
in wells that devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells that devon
does not operate

     the prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect market prices for
oil gas and ngl production subsequent to december 31 2002 there can be no
assurance that all of the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the
periods indicated that the assumed prices will be realized or that existing
contracts will be honored or judicially enforced

     the process of estimating oil gas and ngls reserves is complex requiring
significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological
engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir
may change substantially over time as a result of among other things
additional development activity production history and viability of production
under varying economic conditions consequently material revisions to existing
reserve estimates may occur in the future

operation of properties

     the daytoday operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility
of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements the operator
supervises production maintains production records employs field personnel and
performs other functions the charges under operating agreements customarily
vary with the depth and location of the well being operated

     devon is the operator of 14001 of its wells as operator devon receives
reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as
well as monthly perwell producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates
customarily charged in the area to or by unaffiliated third parties in
presenting its financial data devon records the monthly overhead reimbursements
as a reduction of general and administrative expense which is a common industry
practice

  organization structure

     devons north american properties are concentrated within five geographic
areas operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin the
midcontinent the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions
canadian operations are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in
alberta and british columbia operations outside north america currently include
azerbaijan brazil china and west africa maintaining a tight geographic focus
in selected core areas has allowed devon to improve operating and capital
efficiency

  united states properties

  the permian basin

     the permian basin includes portions of southeast new mexico and west texas
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties from a wide variety of
geologic formations and productive depths the permian basin represented 9 of
devons proved reserves at december 31 2002

     devons leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses more than
102000 acres of developed lands and 237000 acres of undeveloped land and
minerals historically devon has been a very active operator in this area
developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower
risk delaware formation

     in the west texas area of the permian basin devon maintains a base of oil
production with longlife reserves many of these reserves are from both
operated and nonoperated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as
the wasson odc unit the willard unit the reeves unit the north welch unit and
the anton irish clearfork unit these oilproducing units often exhibit long
lives with low decline rates devon also owns a significant acreage position in
west texas with over 194000 acres of developed lands and over 224000 acres of
undeveloped land and minerals at december 31 2002

  midcontinent

     the midcontinent region includes portions of texas oklahoma kansas
mississippi and louisiana these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic
formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas devons
midcontinent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas
properties but devon has recently established two nonconventional gas
operations in the midcontinent region the barnett shale and the cherokee
coalbed methane project the midcontinent region represented 30 of devons
proved reserves at december 31 2002

     the most significant asset acquired by devon in its 2002 acquisition of
mitchell was a substantial interest in the barnett shale of north texas the
barnett shale is known as a tight gas formation this means that in its natural
state the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas mitchell
spent decades understanding how to efficiently develop and produce this gas the
resulting technology yielded a lowrisk and highly profitable natural gas
operation devon holds 525000 net acres and over 1100 producing wells in the
barnett shale devons average working interest is approximately 95 the
barnett shale is a unique unconventional natural gas resource that offers
immediate lowrisk production growth and the potential for additional drilling
locations

     devon has experienced success extracting gas from the barnett shale by
using light sand fracturing light sand fracturing yields better results than
earlier techniques and is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells
and to refracture existing wells refractured wells often exceed their original
flow rates devon is also investigating horizontal drilling and closer well
spacing to further enhance the value of the barnett shale

     devons marketing and midstream business transports treats and processes
its barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated
third parties the transport system consists of approximately 3100 miles of
pipeline a 650 mmcf per day gas processing plant and a 15000 bbls per day ngl
fractionator

     in 2003 devon plans to drill up to 450 new barnett shale wells and
refracture 64 wells devon is also conducting exploratory pilot projects outside
the core development area in an effort to expand the productive area the
barnett shale is expected to continue to be an important growth area for devon
for the foreseeable future current production from the barnett shale is
approximately 345 mmcf and 21700 bbls of oil and ngls per day net

     the other nonconventional asset devon is developing in the midcontinent
region is the cherokee coalbed methane project coalbed methane is natural gas
produced from underground coal deposits devon

                                        17

acquired over 400000 net acres within the cherokee area of southeast kansas and
northeast oklahoma in 2001

     devons east texas properties are a significant conventional asset a large
portion of this asset base was initially acquired in 1999 the carthage and
bethany fields are two of the primary properties these properties produce from
the cotton valley sands the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and
carbonates devon operates over 500 producing wells in this area and utilizes a
one to two rig drilling program to continue the lowrisk infill development of
this area

     the 2002 acquisition of mitchell added a complementary asset base to the
east texas area these properties are located on the western side of the east
texas basin and produce from the bossier cotton valley and travis peaks sands
devon operates approximately 400 producing wells in this area and plans to
continue the development drilling program with one to two rigs devons current
net production in east texas is approximately 123 mmcf and 3800 bbls of oil and
ngls per day

  rocky mountain region

     devons operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in
wyoming utah and northern new mexico these assets include conventional oil
and gas properties and coalbed methane projects as of december 31 2002 the
rocky mountain region comprised 11 of devons proved reserves

     devon began producing coalbed methane in the san juan basin of new mexico
in the mid1980s and began drilling coalbed methane wells in the powder river
basin of wyoming in 1998 as of december 31 2002 devon has drilled over 1500
coalbed methane wells in the powder river basin devons net coalbed methane gas
production from the basin was approximately 80 mmcf per day as of december 31
2002 and devon plans to drill more than 100 wells in the powder river basin in
2003 current production in the basin is primarily from the wyodak coal
formation

     the deeper big george formation is currently being tested by devon and
others with working interests in the area increased development in the big
george is subject to an environmental impact statement which has been completed
and is expected to be approved within the next few months pending this approval
and the success of current pilot projects the big george could significantly
expand the coalbed methane play into the western portion of the powder river
basin devons leasehold in this area would allow for the development of four
projects in the big george

     devon is also continuing to develop conventional gas operations at the
washakie field in wyoming devon drilled 31 wells in 2002 and plans to drill
another 30 wells in 2003 devon has interests in over 200000 acres devons
current net production from washakie is approximately 77 mmcf and 1100 bbls of
oil and ngls per day

  gulf of mexico and gulf coast

     devon is active in the offshore gulf of mexico and onshore south texas and
south louisiana devon operates 100 structures in the gulf of mexico
predominantly in the outer shelf area offshore louisiana the gulf of mexico and
gulf coast region represented 5 of devons proved reserves at december 31
2002

     devon is applying fourcomponent or 4c seismic technology to identify
prospects on large tracts of its shelf acreage traditional seismic techniques
have not been successful in imaging reservoirs lying below shallow gas
reservoirs and salt deposits but 4c seismic technology is allowing devons
geoscientists to more accurately picture these unexplored formations devon has
conducted two large 4c seismic surveys offshore louisiana and in 2002 devon
drilled four successful wells in the west cameron area based on 4c data devon
is also reprocessing large seismic data volumes using prestack depth migration
to prospect for oil and gas in the outer shelf in addition devon is utilizing
new long cable 3d seismic data to better image deep shelf prospects devon has
developed a significant inventory of drilling opportunities for deeper gas near
our infrastructure in offshore louisiana and offshore texas

                                        18

     in the deepwater gulf of mexico devon participated in its first subsalt
discovery in 1999 in the enchilada field located in garden banks 128 since then
devon has operated several successful subsea completions ranging from garden
banks to viosca knoll devon has experience with the successful installation and
operation of subsea production equipment which is an important component of any
deepwater program devons pecten discovery in viosca knoll block 694 a subsea
tieback completed in 2001 is currently producing approximately 17 mmcf of gas
per day

     because deepwater exploration requires significant capital expenditures
devons strategy is to share projects with experienced partners to mitigate
risk in 2002 devon entered into a fourwell joint venture with chevrontexaco
that will earn devon a 25 working interest in 71 deepwater blocks and 14
identified exploratory prospects devon also made a potentially significant
discovery in 2002 in 8200 feet of water at cascade located in walker ridge
block 206 and plans to participate with other partners in four or five deepwater
wells in 2003 including a confirmation well at cascade

     devons operations in the gulf coast region include operations onshore in
south texas where exploration for oil and gas is accelerating devons
activities in this area have focused on exploration in the edwards wilcox and
friovicksburg formations devon also acquired additional production and
undeveloped acreage in the south texas area from its acquisition of mitchell

  canada

     devons acquisition of anderson in late 2001 significantly increased the
relative importance of devons canadian operations the anderson acquisition
strengthened devons holdings in the deep basin located in western alberta and
eastern british columbia and the foothills region of northeastern british
columbia as of december 31 2002 36 of devons proved reserves were in
canada

     devon had sought for years to obtain a significant acreage position in the
deep basin but other operators including anderson already controlled most of
the acreage as a result of the anderson acquisition devon now holds over
800000 net acres in the deep basin the profitability of devons operations in
the deep basin is enhanced by its ownership in nine gas processing plants in the
area devon plans to drill about 100 wells in the deep basin in 2003 these
reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids producing up to 100 barrels of ngls with
each mmcf of gas

     late in 2002 devon commenced production from the first of several wells it
has drilled in the grizzly valley area of the foothills region of northeastern
british columbia due to gas pipeline and processing limitations initial
production has been limited to 10 mmcf of gas per day however a pipeline
extension slated for completion in the second quarter of 2003 should allow
production to increase to about 35 mmcf per day

     devon acquired from anderson approximately 15 million net acres in the
mackenzie delta region and the shallow waters of the beaufort sea in northern
canada in 2002 a devon well in the mackenzie delta encountered over 110 feet
of natural gas pay in the kamik sand two to three more exploratory wells are
planned by devon in the mackenzie delta in 2003

     devon has been active for over a decade in northeastern british columbia
an area in which devon owns approximately 135 million net undeveloped acres of
land in 2002 devon participated in the drilling of 67 gross wells and plans to
participate in the drilling of approximately 93 wells in 2003

     the peace river arch area is a more mature area with both light oil and
natural gas potential most of devons position in the peace river arch was
acquired through the anderson acquisition devon holds roughly 730000 net
undeveloped acres in the peace river arch and the average production in 2002
was approximately 140 mmcf of natural gas and 7500 bbls of ngls per day net in
2003 devon plans to participate in the drilling of 71 gross wells in the peace
river arch devon has an interest in a production and processing infrastructure
in the peace river arch which enhances devons operations in the area

     in the northern plains region of northeastern alberta devon has been
active for many years while the area is a highly developed area with
winteronly access devon is very active drilling in excess of 100 gross wells
per year in 2002 average daily net production from the area was about 150 mmcf
of natural gas and approximately 3400 bbls of ngls net natural gas is
encountered in multiple horizons at depths generally less than 1300 feet devon
holds approximately 2 million net undeveloped acres in this area

     devon has about 400000 net undeveloped acres in the central and southern
region of alberta and the average production from this area in 2002 was
approximately 80 mmcf of natural gas and 20000 bbls of ngls per day net
planned activity in 2003 includes drilling approximately 70 gross wells that
vary from deep devonian tests to shallow cretaceous tests

     devon is also active in exploration for and production of coldflow heavy
oil in the lloydminster area of alberta and saskatchewan where oil is found in
multiple horizons generally at depths of 1000 to 2000 feet in 2003 devon
plans to drill 134 gross wells with primarily a development focus average daily
production from the area in 2002 was approximately 37 mmcf of natural gas and
13750 bbls of crude oil net

     devon is also active in the evaluation of thermal heavy oil in alberta
through its 13 ownership interest in the surmont project operated by
conocophillips and is actively evaluating the development of a 100 working
interest heavy oil lease at jackfish and an 83 working interest heavy oil
project at dover each of these heavy oil projects target bitumen heavy
tarlike oil through the use of steam assisted gravity drainage whereby a pair
of horizontal wells are utilized steam is injected in one well and is used to
heat the bitumen to allow it to gravity drain to the other horizontal production
well

  international

     devons international activities are currently focused in development
projects in azerbaijan and china and deepwater exploration in the combined south
atlantic margin of brazil and west africa in 2002 devon divested all remaining
interests in argentina indonesia and egypt as of december 31 2002 9 of
devons proved reserves were in countries outside north america

     in azerbaijan devon has a 56 carried working interest in the large
azerichiraggunashli or acg oil development project devon estimates that the
acg field contains over 46 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves the
development project commenced in 2002 the bakutbilisiceyhan btc pipeline
to export oil for this project has been approved by the governments of
azerbaijan georgia and turkey

     in china devon is an acreage holder in the pearl river mouth basin in the
south china sea and has been successful in discovering two new fields devon is
currently developing the devon operated panyu development project and expects
oil production from two offshore platforms and into a floating production
storage and offloading vessel to commence in late 2003 gross capital
expenditures for the project are 340 million with devon owning a 245 working
interest peak production is expected to reach 58000 bbls of oil per day
15000 bbls of oil per day net to devon in 2004

     devons international exploration efforts are strategically focused in the
combined south atlantic deep water region of west africa and brazil devons
presence in west africa began in 1992 with exploration efforts resulting in the
discoveries of the tchatamba fields in the shallow waters offshore gabon in
this region devon has five blocks and holds over 32 million net acres devon
plans to drill deepwater exploratory wells in its west africa portfolio in ghana
and gabon in 2003 in brazil devon will be acquiring a 3d survey in a
devonoperated deepwater block in early 2003 in order to identify future
drilling opportunities

title to properties

     title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the
oil and gas industry liens for current taxes not yet due and in some
instances other encumbrances devon believes that such burdens do not
materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective
interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the
business

     as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties
little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition other
than a preliminary review of local records investigations generally including
a title opinion of outside counsel are made prior to the consummation of an
acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling
operations on undeveloped properties

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

     the following discussion and analysis addresses changes in devons
financial condition and results of operations during the three year period of
2000 through 2002 reference is made to item 6 selected financial data and
item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

overview

     on january 24 2002 devon completed its acquisition of mitchell energy 
development corp mitchell under the terms of this merger devon issued
approximately 30 million shares of devon common stock and paid 16 billion in
cash to the mitchell stockholders the cash portion of the acquisition was
funded from borrowings under a 30 billion senior unsecured term loan credit
facility the mitchell merger added approximately 404 million boe to devons
proved reserves

     following the mitchell merger announcement in august 2001 devon announced
on september 4 2001 that it had entered into an agreement to acquire anderson
exploration ltd anderson for approximately 35 billion in cash this
acquisition closed on october 15 2001 and therefore had an impact on devons
results for the last two and onehalf months of 2001 the anderson acquisition
added approximately 534 million boe to devons proved reserves

     to fund the cash portions of these two acquisitions as well as to pay
related transaction costs and retire certain longterm debt assumed from
mitchell and anderson devon entered into longterm debt agreements in october
2001 that totaled 6 billion half of this total consisted of 3 billion of
notes and debentures issued on october 3 2001 of this total 125 billion
bears interest at 7875 and matures in september 2031 the remaining 175
billion bears interest at 6875 and matures in september 2011

     the remaining 3 billion of the 6 billion of longterm debt is in the form
of a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates as of december 31
2002 19 billion of the original 3 billion balance had been retired the
primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of 1 billion of debt
securities of which 08 billion was used to pay down debt and 14 billion
from the sale of certain oil and gas properties of which 11 billion was used
to pay down debt as of december 31 2002 the balance outstanding under the
term loan credit facility was 11 billion at an average rate of 25 principal
payments due on this debt are 03 billion in april 2006 and 08 billion in
october 2006

     the mitchell and anderson acquisitions followed another significant
acquisition in august 2000 devon closed its merger with santa fe snyder
corporation this transaction added approximately 386 million boe to devons
proved reserves

     in addition to the mergers and acquisitions devons exploration and
development efforts have also been significant contributors to devons growth
in 2002 devon spent 15 billion in its exploration drilling and development
efforts these costs included drilling 1685 wells of which 1599 were
completed as producers in 2000 and 2001 devon spent an aggregate of 20
billion in its exploration drilling and development efforts these costs
included drilling 2873 wells of which 2705 were completed as producers

     the following statistics illustrate the effects that devons mergers and
acquisitions and its drilling and development activities have had on operations
during the last three years this data compares devons 2002 results to those of
2000 for devon combined with santa fe snyder which was acquired in a merger
accounted for under the poolingofinterests method such comparison yields the
following fluctuations

      proved reserves increased 651 million boe or 68

      combined oil gas and ngl production increased 75 million boe or 66

      total revenues increased 17 billion or 67

      net cash provided by operating activities increased 165 million or 10

                                        27

     during 2002 devon marked its 14th anniversary as a public company while
devon has consistently increased production over this 14year period volatility
in oil gas and ngl prices has resulted in considerable variability in earnings
and cash flows prices for oil natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by
market conditions market conditions for these products have been and will
continue to be influenced by regional and worldwide economic activity weather
and other factors that are beyond devons control devons future earnings and
cash flows will continue to depend on market conditions

     like all oil and gas exploration and production companies devon faces the
challenge of natural production decline as initial pressures are depleted oil
and gas production from a given well naturally decreases thus an oil and gas
exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each
unit of oil or gas it produces historically devon has been able to overcome
this natural decline by adding through drilling and acquisitions more reserves
than it produces devons future growth if any will depend on its ability to
continue to add reserves in excess of production

     because oil gas and ngl prices are influenced by many factors outside of
its control devons management has focused its efforts on increasing oil and
gas reserves and production and controlling expenses over its 14year history
as a public company devon has been able to reduce its controllable operating
costs per unit of production devons future earnings and cash flows are
dependent on its ability to continue to contain operating costs at levels that
allow for profitable production

  oil revenues

     2002 vs 2001  oil revenues increased 125 million in 2002 an increase in
production of 6 million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by 112 million
the anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for 11 million barrels of
increased production this was partially offset by the effect of divestitures
which reduced 2002 production by 5 million barrels a 030 per barrel increase
in the average oil price in 2002 accounted for the remaining 13 million of
increased oil revenues

     2001 vs 2000  oil revenues decreased 122 million in 2001 a 358 per
barrel decrease in 2001s average price caused revenues to drop by 114 million
a decrease in production of one million barrels caused oil revenues to decrease
by an additional 8 million the october 2001 anderson merger accounted for
three million barrels of 2001 production however oil production from devons
other properties declined four million barrels this reduction was primarily the
result of domestic and international properties which were sold prior to 2001
but whose production was included in 2000 prior to the sales

  gas revenues

     2002 vs 2001  gas revenues increased 255 million in 2002 an increase in
production of 272 bcf caused gas revenues to increase by 10 billion the
anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for 323 bcf of increased
production this was partially offset by the effect of divestitures which
reduced 2002

production by 30 bcf and by natural declines in production the effects of the
net production increase were partially offset by a 104 per mcf decrease in the
average gas price in 2002

     2001 vs 2000  gas revenues increased 404 million in 2001 of this total
increase 253 million was due to a 72 bcf increase in production in 2001 the
october 2001 anderson merger accounted for 51 bcf of the increase production
from devons domestic properties increased 21 bcf due primarily to drilling and
development in devons coalbed methane properties as well as the acquisition of
certain properties in the second quarter of 2001 a 031 per mcf increase in
the average gas price in 2001 accounted for the remaining 151 million of
increased gas revenues

  ngl revenues

     2002 vs 2001  ngl revenues increased 144 million in 2002 an 11 million
barrel increase in 2002 production caused revenues to increase 202 million the
anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for 12 million barrels of increased
production this was partially offset by production lost from divestitures the
effects of the net production increase were partially offset by a 294 per
barrel decrease in the average ngl price in 2002

     2001 vs 2000  ngl revenues decreased 23 million in 2001 a decrease in
2001s average price of 388 per barrel caused ngl revenues to decrease 30
million this was partially offset by a 7 million increase related to a
production increase of one million barrels the october 2001 anderson merger
accounted for all of the increase

  marketing and midstream revenues

     2002 vs 2001  marketing and midstream revenues increased 928 million in
2002 the mitchell acquisition included significant marketing and midstream
assets which accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenues

     2001 vs 2000  marketing and midstream revenues increased 18 million in
2001 this increase was primarily the result of capacity additions to devons
wyoming gas pipeline systems

     2002 vs 2001  lease operating expenses increased 154 million in 2002 the
anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for 210 million of the increase
the historical devon lease operating expenses decreased 56 million primarily
due to divestitures the drop in lease operating expenses per boe from 371 in
2001 to 330 in 2002 was primarily related to the lower cost properties
acquired in the anderson and mitchell acquisitions and the divestiture of some
of devons higher cost properties

     transportation costs represent those costs paid directly to thirdparty
providers to transport oil gas and ngl production sold downstream from the
wellhead transportation costs increased 71 million in 2002 primarily due to an
increase in gas production from the anderson and mitchell acquisitions

     the majority of devons production taxes are assessed on its onshore
domestic properties in the us most of the production taxes are based on a
fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 6 decrease in domestic oil gas
and ngls revenues was the primary cause of a 4 decrease in production taxes

     2001 vs 2000  recurring lease operating expenses increased 79 million in
2001 the anderson acquisition accounted for 47 million of the increase in
expenses the remaining increase in recurring costs was primarily caused by
higher thirdparty service fuel and electricity costs

     transportation costs increased 30 million in 2001 of this increase 12
million related to the anderson acquisition the remainder of the increase was
primarily due to an increase in gas production from devons domestic drilling
and development activities

     as previously stated most of the us production taxes are based on a
fixed percentage of revenues therefore the 4 increase in domestic oil gas
and ngl revenues was the primary cause of a 11 increase in domestic production
taxes production taxes did not increase proportionately to the increase in
revenues this was primarily due to the fact that most of the increase in
domestic revenues occurred in the western division which has higher production
tax rates than the other domestic divisions

  depreciation depletion and amortization dda

     dda of oil and gas properties is calculated as the percentage of total
proved reserve volumes produced during the year multiplied by the net
capitalized investment in those reserves including estimated future development
and dismantlement and abandonment costs the depletable base generally if
reserve volumes are revised up or down then the dda rate per unit of
production will change inversely however if the depletable base changes then
the dda rate moves in the same direction the per unit dda rate is not
affected by production volumes absolute or total dda as
                                        33
page

opposed to the rate per unit of production generally moves in the same
direction as production volumes oil and gas property dda is calculated
separately on a countrybycountry basis

     2002 vs 2001  oil and gas property related dda increased 313 million in
2002 a 50 increase in 2002s oil gas and ngls production caused dda to
increase 394 million the effects of the production increase were partially
offset by a decrease in the combined us canadian and international dda rate
from 630 per boe in 2001 to 588 per boe in 2002 the drop in the dda rate
was primarily due to reductions of carrying value of oil and gas properties
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2002

     nonoil and gas property dda increased 67 million in 2002 compared to
2001 depreciation of the marketing and midstream assets acquired in the january
2002 mitchell acquisition accounted for substantially all of the increase

     2001 vs 2000  oil and gas property related dda increased 161 million in
2001 of this total increase 70 million was due to the 12 increase in oil
gas and ngls production in 2001 the remaining 91 million increase was due to
an increase in the consolidated dda rate this rate increased from 558 per
boe in 2000 to 630 per boe in 2001

     nonoil and gas property dda increased 8 million in 2001 compared to
2000 depreciation of devons wyoming gas pipeline systems accounted for the
2001 increase

  amortization of goodwill

     effective january 1 2002 devon adopted the remaining provisions of
statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets sfas no 142 under sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized as they were prior
to 2002 but are instead tested for impairment at least annually prior to the
adoption of sfas no 142 devons goodwill amortization was 34 million and 41
million in 2001 and 2000 respectively

  marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses

     2002 vs 2001  marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses
increased 761 million in 2002 the mitchell acquisition included significant
marketing and midstream assets which accounted for substantially all of the
increase in revenues

     2001 vs 2000  marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses
increased 19 million in 2001 this increase was primarily the result of
capacity additions to devons wyoming gas pipeline systems

  general and administrative expenses ga

     devons net ga consists of three primary components the largest of these
components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs office
expenses professional fees and other ga items the gross amount of these
expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components one is the amount of
ga capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting the other is the
amount of ga reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which
devon serves as the operator these reimbursements are received during both the
drilling and operational stages of a propertys life the gross amount of ga
incurred less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed is recorded as net ga in
the consolidated statements of operations net ga includes expenses related to
oil gas and ngl exploration

     2002 vs 2001  gross ga increased 139 million primarily due to additional
costs incurred as a result of the anderson and mitchell acquisitions also
included in 2002s gross ga was 13 million related to the abandonment of
certain office space assumed in the santa fe snyder merger ga was reduced 20
million due to an increase in the amount capitalized as part of oil and gas
properties ga was also reduced 14 million by an increase in the amount of
reimbursements on operated properties changes in both of the capitalized and
reimbursed amounts were primarily related to the anderson and mitchell
acquisitions

     2001 vs 2000  gross ga increased 39 million primarily due to additional
costs incurred as a result of the anderson acquisition and additional personnel
related costs ga was reduced 15 million due to an increase in the amount
capitalized the increase in capitalized ga was primarily related to additional
personnel related costs and increased acquisition exploration and development
activities ga was also reduced 6 million by an increase in the amount of
reimbursements on operated properties the increase in reimbursed ga was
primarily related to an increase in the number of operated properties

  expenses related to mergers

     approximately 1 million of expenses were incurred in 2001 in connection
with the anderson acquisition these costs related to devon employees who were
terminated as part of the anderson acquisition

     approximately 60 million of expenses were incurred in 2000 in connection
with the santa fe snyder merger these expenses consisted primarily of severance
and other benefit costs investment banking fees other professional expenses
costs associated with duplicate facilities and various transaction related
costs the poolingofinterests method of accounting for business combinations
required such costs to be expensed as opposed to capitalized as costs of the
transaction

  reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties

     under the full cost method of accounting the net book value of oil and gas
properties less related deferred income taxes may not exceed a calculated
ceiling the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated aftertax future
net revenues from proved oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not
subject to amortization the ceiling is imposed separately by country in
calculating future net revenues current prices and costs are generally held
constant indefinitely and devon does not include the effect of hedges in the
calculation of the future net revenues the calculation also dictates the use of
a 10 discount factor therefore the ceiling limitation is not necessarily
indicative of the properties fair value the costs to be recovered are compared
to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered exceed the
ceiling the excess is written off as an expense except as discussed in the
following paragraph

     if subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable
financial statements being published prices increase to levels such that the
ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered a writedown otherwise indicated
at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded a writedown indicated
at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves
proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing
of the financial statements would result
                                        35
page

in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered as long as the properties
were owned at the end of the quarter

     an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling
applicable to the subsequent period

     during 2002 and 2001 devon reduced the carrying value of its oil and gas
properties by 651 and 883 million respectively due to the full cost ceiling
limitations the aftertax effect of these reductions in 2002 and 2001 was 371
million and 533 million respectively the following table summarizes these
reductions by country

     the 2002 canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower prices under
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations acquired oil and
gas properties are recorded at fair value as of the date of purchase devon
estimates such fair value using its estimates of future oil gas and ngl prices
in contrast the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the
last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely accordingly
the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the
reserves the recorded fair values of oil and gas properties added from the
anderson acquisition in 2001 were based on expected future oil and gas prices
that were higher than the june 30 2002 prices used to calculate the canadian
ceiling

     based on oil natural gas and ngl cash market prices as of june 30 2002
devons canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by
371 million this aftertax amount resulted in a pretax reduction of the
carrying value of devons canadian oil and gas properties of 651 million in the
second quarter of 2002 this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in
canadian gas prices during the last half of june 2002 the end of june reference
prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation expressed in canadian dollars
based on an exchange ratio of 06585 were a nymex price of c4079 per barrel
of oil and an aeco price of c217 per mmbtu the cash market prices of natural
gas increased during the month of july 2002 prior to devons release of its
second quarter results but the increase was not sufficient to offset the entire
reduction calculated as of june 30

     the 2001 domestic and canadian reductions were also primarily the result of
lower prices the oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition and
other smaller acquisitions in 2001 were recorded at fair values that were based
on expected future oil and gas prices higher than the december 31 2001 prices
used to calculate the ceiling the yearend 2001 prices used to calculate the
ceiling were based on a nymex oil price of 1984 per barrel a henry hub gas
price of 265 per mmbtu and an aeco gas price of c367 per mmbtu

     additionally during 2001 devon elected to abandon operations in thailand
malaysia qatar and on certain properties in brazil after meeting the drilling
and capital commitments on these properties devon determined that these
properties did not meet devons internal criteria to justify further investment
accordingly devon recorded a 96 million charge associated with the impairment
of these properties the aftertax effect of this reduction was 78 million

     the provisions of sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal
of longlived assets which devon was required to adopt effective january 1
2002 are only required to be applied prospectively as a result these
impairment charges have not been reclassified as part of the discontinued
operations on the consolidated statements of operations

  interest expense

     2002 vs 2001  interest expense increased 313 million in 2002 an increase
in the average debt balance outstanding from 30 billion in 2001 to 83
billion in 2002 caused interest expense to increase 319 million the increase
in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the longterm debt
issued and assumed as a result of the mitchell and anderson acquisitions

     the average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased from 66 in 2001
to 60 in 2002 due to the favorable rates on the borrowings under the 3
billion term loan credit facility this facilitys rates averaged less than 3
during 2002 the overall rate decrease caused interest expense to decrease 20
million in 2002 other items included in interest expense that are not related
to the debt balance outstanding were 14 million higher in 2002 items not
related to the balance of debt outstanding include early retirement premiums
facility and agency fees amortization of costs and other miscellaneous items
of the 14 million increase in other items during 2002 5 million related to
the amortization of capitalized loan costs and 3 million related to an increase
in the accretion of debt discounts these increases were primarily due to the
additional debt incurred as a result of the mitchell and anderson acquisitions

     2001 vs 2000  interest expense increased 65 million in 2001 of this
total increase 44 million was caused by an increase in the average debt
balance outstanding from 23 billion in 2000 to 30 billion in 2001 the
increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the longterm
debt issued and assumed as a result of the october 2001 anderson acquisition

     the average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased from 67 in 2000
to 66 in 2001 this rate decrease caused interest expense to decrease 1
million in 2001 other items included in interest expense that are not related
to the debt balance outstanding were 22 million higher in 2001 compared to
2000 the increase in other items was primarily related to an increase in
accretion of discounts and a 7 million loss related to an early retirement
premium

page

     the increase in accretion of debt discounts in 2001 was related to the
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 133 sfas no 133
effective january 1 2001 devons debentures that are exchangeable into shares
of chevrontexaco corporation chevrontexaco common stock were revalued as of
august 17 1999 this is the date the debentures were assumed as part of the
pennzenergy merger under sfas no 133 the total fair value of the debentures
was allocated between the interestbearing debt and the option to exchange
chevrontexaco common stock that is embedded in the debentures accordingly the
debt portion of the debentures was reduced by 140 million as of august 17
1999 this discount is being accreted in interest expense which has raised the
effective interest rate on the debentures to 776 in 2001 compared to 492
recorded prior to 2001 the accretion in 2001 was 12 million

  effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

     2002 vs 2001  as a result of the anderson acquisition a canadian
subsidiary has 400 million of fixedrate senior notes which are denominated in
us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the
canadian dollar from the dates the notes were acquired to the dates of repayment
increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars eventually required
to repay the notes such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of
the debt are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period
in which the exchange rate changes the increase in the canadiantous dollar
exchange rate from 0628 at december 31 2001 to 0633 at december 31 2002
resulted in a 1 million gain the drop in the canadiantous dollar exchange
rate from 0642 at october 15 2001 when the debt was assumed to 0628 at
december 31 2001 resulted in an 11 million loss

     2001 vs 2000  until midjanuary 2000 a canadian subsidiary had certain
fixedrate senior notes which were denominated in us dollars in midjanuary
2000 these notes were retired prior to maturity the canadiantous dollar
exchange rate dropped slightly in january prior to the debt retirement as a
result 3 million of expense was recognized in 2000

  change in fair value of financial instruments

     2002 vs 2001  as required under the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting
for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 138
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an
amendment of sfas no 133 devon records in its statements of operations the
change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment

     during 2002 and 2001 devon recorded 20 million and 8 million
respectively of gains related to changes in fair value the gains related
principally to the option embedded in devons debentures that are exchangeable
into shares of chevrontexaco common stock also devon recorded an 8 million
net gain in 2002 and a 10 million net charge in 2001 related to the
ineffectiveness of the various cash flow hedges

  impairment of chevrontexaco corporation common stock

     devon owns approximately 71 million common shares of chevrontexaco the
market value of these shares as of december 31 2002 was approximately 472
million devon acquired these shares in its august 1999 acquisition of
pennzenergy company the shares are deposited with an exchange agent for
possible exchange for 760 million of debentures that are exchangeable into the
chevrontexaco shares the debentures which mature in august 2008 were also
assumed by devon in the 1999 pennzenergy acquisition

     devon initially recorded the chevrontexaco common shares at their market
value at the closing date of the pennzenergy acquisition which was 9538 per
share or an aggregate value of 677 million since then as the chevrontexaco
shares have fluctuated in market value the value of the shares on devons
balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable market value through
september 30 2002 any decreases in the value of the chevrontexaco common
shares were determined by devon to be temporary

                                        38

in nature therefore the changes in value were recorded directly to
stockholders equity and were not recorded in devons results of operations
through september 30 2002

     the determination that a decline in value of the chevrontexaco shares is
temporary or other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors
among these factors are the significance of the decline as a percentage of the
original cost the length of time the stock price has been below original cost
the performance of the stock price in relation to the stock price of its
competitors within the industry and the market in general and whether the
decline is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting chevrontexaco

     beginning in july 2002 the market value of chevrontexaco common stock
began what has ultimately become a significant decline the price per share
decreased from 8850 at june 30 2002 to 6925 per share at september 30
2002 and to 6648 per share at december 31 2002 the yearend price of 6648
represents a 25 decline since june 30 2002 and a 30 decline from the
original valuation in august 1999 as a result of the continuation of the
decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2002 devon determined that the
decline is other than temporary as that term is defined by accounting rules
therefore the 205 million cumulative decrease in the value of the
chevrontexaco common shares from the initial acquisition in august 1999 to
december 31 2002 was recorded as a noncash charge to devons results of
operations in the fourth quarter of 2002 net of the applicable tax benefit the
charge reduced net earnings by 128 million

     depending on the future performance of chevrontexacos common stock devon
may be required to record additional noncash charges in future periods if devon
determines that a decline in the value of such stock is other than temporary

  other income

     2002 vs 2001  other income decreased 35 million or 51 in 2002 other
income in 2001 included a 30 million gain from the settlement of a foreign
exchange forward purchase contract entered into by devon related to the funding
of the anderson acquisition this gain did not recur in 2002

     2001 vs 2000  other revenues increased 29 million or 73 in 2001 as
discussed previously 2001 other income included a 30 million gain from the
settlement of a foreign exchange forward purchase contract entered into by devon
related to the funding of the anderson acquisition

  income taxes

     2001 vs 2000  devons 2002 effective financial tax rate attributable to
continuing operations was a benefit of 144 compared to an effective financial
tax rate expense of 18 in 2001 excluding the effects of the impairment of
chevrontexaco stock in 2002 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas
properties in 2002 and 2001 the effective financial tax expense rates were 23
and 37 in 2002 and 2001 respectively

     the 2002 rate excluding the chevrontexaco common stock impairment and the
oil and gas property writedown was lower than the statutory federal tax rate
primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions the 2001 rate
excluding the oil and gas property writedowns was higher than the statutory
federal tax rate due to the effect of state taxes goodwill amortization that
was not deductible for income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income
taxes

     2001 vs 2000  devons 2001 and 2000 effective financial tax expense rates
were 18 and 36 respectively excluding the effects of the reduction of
carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2001 the effective financial tax
expense rate was 37 in 2001 the 2001 rate was higher than the statutory
federal tax rate of 35 due to the effect of state taxes goodwill amortization
that was not deductible for income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income
taxes the 2000 rate was higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the
effect of state taxes goodwill amortization that was not deductible for income
tax purposes and the effect of foreign income taxes offset in part by the
recognition of a benefit from the disposition of devons assets in venezuela

  results of discontinued operations

     effective january 1 2002 devon was required to adopt sfas no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which supersedes
both sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions
of apb opinion no 30 reporting the results of operations  reporting the
effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of
a business as previously defined in that opinion

     on april 18 2002 devon sold its indonesian operations to petrochina
company limited for total cash consideration of 250 million on october 25
2002 devon sold its argentine operations to petroleo brasileiro sa for total
cash consideration of 90 million on january 27 2003 devon sold its egyptian
operations to ipr transoil corporation for total cash consideration of 7
million

     under the provisions of sfas no 144 devon has reclassified its
indonesian argentine and egyptian activities as discontinued operations this
reclassification affects not only the 2002 presentation of financial results
but also the presentation of all prior periods results

     following are the components of the net results of discontinued operations
for the years 2002 2001 and 2000



                                                                   year ended

     2002 vs 2001  the decrease in earnings from discontinued operations before
income taxes and the related income taxes from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to
the sale of these operations during 2002

     2001 vs 2000  the decrease in earnings from discontinued operations before
income taxes and the related income taxes from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to
a decline in oil prices and the recognition of a 24 million reduction in the
carrying value of egyptian oil and gas properties the reduction in egypt was
the result of high finding and development costs and negative revisions to
proved reserves

  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

     at the time of adoption of sfas no 133 devon recorded a
cumulativeeffecttype adjustment to net earnings for a 49 million gain related
to the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges this gain
included 46 million related to the option embedded in the debentures that are
exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock

capital expenditures capital resources and liquidity

     the following discussion of capital expenditures capital resources and
liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash
flows included elsewhere in this report

  capital expenditures

     approximately 34 billion was spent in 2002 for capital expenditures this
total includes 17 billion related to the january 2002 mitchell acquisition
16 billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and
gas properties and 01 billion related to marketing and midstream assets
these amounts compare to 2001 total expenditures of 52 billion 35 billion
of which related to the october 2001 anderson acquisition and 16 billion of
which was related to other acquisitions and the drilling or

                                        40
page

development of oil and gas properties and 2000 total expenditures of 11
billion 10 billion of which was related to the drilling or development of oil
and gas properties

  other cash uses

     devons common stock dividends were 31 million 25 million and 22
million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively devon also paid 10 million of
preferred stock dividends in 2002 2001 and 2000

     during 2001 devon repurchased 3754000 shares of common stock at an
aggregate cost of 190 million or 5071 per share devon also repurchased
shares of its common stock in 2001 under an oddlot repurchase program pursuant
to this program devon purchased and retired 232000 shares of its common stock
for a total cost of 14 million or 5740 per share

  capital resources and liquidity

     devons primary source of liquidity has historically been net cash provided
by operating activities operating cash flow this source has been
supplemented as needed by accessing credit lines and commercial paper markets
and issuing equity securities and longterm debt securities in 2002 another
major source of liquidity was 14 billion generated from sales of oil and gas
properties

  operating cash flow

     devons operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most
volatile of which is pricing of the oil natural gas and ngls produced prices
for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions
regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially
variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors
are beyond devons control and are difficult to predict

     to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices devon
has entered into various fixedprice physical delivery contracts and financial
price swap contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil
and natural gas production additionally devon has utilized price collars to
set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of its production the table below
provides the volumes associated with these various arrangements as of january
31 2003



                                            fixedprice physical   price swap    price
                                             delivery contracts    contracts    collars   total

  2004           16                          47       63


     in addition to the above quantities devon also has fixedprice physical
delivery contracts for the years 2005 through 2011 covering canadian natural
gas production ranging from 8 bcf to 14 bcf per year from 2012 through 2016
devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixedprice contracts but the
yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf

     by removing the price volatility from a portion of its oil and natural gas
production devon has mitigated but not eliminated the potential negative
effect of declining prices on its operating cash flow the combination of
fixedprice contracts price swaps and price collars currently in place
represents approximately 55 of estimated 2003 oil production and 39 of
estimated 2003 natural gas production

     it is devons policy to only enter into derivative contracts with
investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management as competent and
competitive market makers

                                        41

     in december 2002 devon announced that its capital expenditure budget for
the year 2003 was approximately 18 billion this capital budget represents the
largest planned use of available operating cash flow to a certain degree the
ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within devons control
therefore if oil and natural gas prices decline to levels below its acceptable
levels devon could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2003 capital
expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources
and uses of liquidity based upon current oil and gas price expectations for
2003 devon anticipates that its operating cash flow will exceed its planned
capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year devon currently
intends to accumulate any excess cash to fund future years debt maturities
additional alternatives could be considered based upon the actual amount if
any of such excess cash

  credit lines

     other sources of liquidity are devons revolving lines of credit on june
7 2002 devon renewed the 800 million 364day portion of its unsecured
longterm credit facilities the credit facilities the credit facilities
include a us facility of 725 million the us facility and a canadian
facility of 275 million the canadian facility

     the 725 million us facility consists of a tranche a facility of 200
million and a tranche b facility of 525 million the tranche a facility matures
on october 15 2004 devon may borrow funds under the tranche b facility until
june 5 2003 the tranche b revolving period devon may request that the
tranche b revolving period be extended an additional 364 days by notifying the
agent bank of such request between 30 and 60 days prior to the end of the
tranche b revolving period on june 6 2003 at the end of the tranche b
revolving period devon may convert the then outstanding balance under the
tranche b facility to a twoyear term loan by paying the agent a fee of 125
basis points the applicable borrowing rate would be at libor plus 125 basis
points on december 31 2002 there were no borrowings outstanding under the
725 million us facility the available capacity under the us facility as of
december 31 2002 net of 25 million of outstanding letters of credit was 700
million

     devon may borrow funds under the 275 million canadian facility until june
5 2003 the canadian facility revolving period devon may request that the
canadian facility revolving period be extended an additional 364 days by
notifying the agent bank of such request between 30 and 60 days prior to the end
of the canadian facility revolving period debt outstanding as of the end of the
canadian facility revolving period is payable in semiannual installments of 25
each for the following five years with the final installment due five years and
one day following the end of the canadian facility revolving period on december
31 2002 there were no borrowings under the 275 million canadian facility

     under the terms of the credit facilities devon has the right to reallocate
up to 100 million of the unused tranche b facility maximum credit amount to the
canadian facility conversely devon also has the right to reallocate up to 100
million of unused canadian facility maximum credit amount to the tranche b
facility

     amounts borrowed under the credit facilities bear interest at various fixed
rate options that devon may elect for periods up to six months devon has
historically elected a rate that is based upon libor plus a margin dictated by
devons debt rating borrowings under the canadian facility have also been made
under a rate based upon the bankers acceptance rate plus a margin dictated by
devons debt rating based upon its current debt rating devon can borrow under
the credit facilities at a rate of between 45 and 125 basis points above libor
based upon usage and the tranche utilized and 725 basis points above the
bankers acceptance rate the credit facilities also provide for an annual
facility fee of 14 million that is payable quarterly

     devon also has access to shortterm credit under its commercial paper
program total borrowings under the us facility and the commercial paper
program may not exceed 725 million commercial paper debt generally has a
maturity of between seven to 90 days although it can have a maturity of up to
365 days devon had no commercial paper debt outstanding at december 31 2002

     on july 25 2002 devon renewed and increased its letter of credit and
revolving bank facility loc facility for its canadian operations this c150
million loc facility will be used primarily by devons whollyowned
subsidiaries devon canada corporation and northstar energy corporation to
issue letters of credit as of december 31 2002 c109 million 69 million
converted to us dollars using the december 31 2002 exchange rate of letters
of credit were issued under the loc facility primarily for canadian drilling
commitments

     a portion of cash used in the anderson and mitchell acquisitions was
provided by a 3 billion senior unsecured credit facility this credit facility
which was entered into in october 2001 has a term of five years the 3 billion
credit facility was fully borrowed upon the closing of the mitchell acquisition
on january 24 2002 however as of december 31 2002 19 billion of the
balance had been retired the primary sources of the repayments were the
issuance of 1 billion of debt securities of which 08 billion was used to pay
down debt and 14 billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties of
which 11 billion was used to pay down debt

     the remaining balance outstanding as of december 31 2002 will mature as
follows



                                                               in millions

                                                                  1135
                                                                  


     this 3 billion facility includes various rate options which can be elected
by devon including a rate based on libor plus a margin through june 17 2002
this margin was fixed at 100 basis points thereafter the margin is based on
devons debt rating based on devons current debt rating the margin after june
17 2002 is 100 basis points as of december 31 2002 the average interest
rate on this facility was 25

     devons credit facilities and its 3 billion term loan credit facility each
contain only one material financial covenant this covenant requires devon to
maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization of no more than
65 the credit agreements contain definitions of total funded debt and total
capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in
devons consolidated financial statements in accordance with the agreements
total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of
chevrontexaco common stock also total capitalization is adjusted to add back
noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or
goodwill impairments as of december 31 2002 devons ratio of total funded
debt to total capitalization as defined in its credit agreements was 550

     devons access to funds from its credit facilities is not restricted under
any material adverse condition clauses it is not uncommon for credit
agreements to include such clauses these clauses can remove the obligation of
the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrowers financial
condition operations properties or prospects considered as a whole the
borrowers ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of
material terms of the credit agreement while devons credit facilities and its
3 billion term loan credit facility include covenants that require devon to
report a condition or event having a material adverse effect on the company the
obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the
absence of a material adverse effect

  longterm debt securities

     on march 25 2002 devon sold 1 billion of 795 notes due april 15 2032
the net proceeds received after discounts and issuance costs were 986
million the debt securities are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of
devon the net proceeds were partially used to pay down 820 million on devons
3 billion term loan credit facility the remaining 166 million of net proceeds
was used in june

                                        43
page

2002 to partially fund the early extinguishment of 175 million of 875 senior
subordinated notes due june 15 2007 the notes were redeemed at 104375 of
principal or approximately 183 million

  debt ratings

     devon receives debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united
states in determining devons debt rating the agencies consider a number of
items including but not limited to debt levels planned asset sales nearterm
and longterm production growth opportunities capital allocation challenges
liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing
levels

     devons current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by standard 
poors baa2 with a negative outlook by moodys and bbb with a stable outlook by
fitch there are no rating triggers in any of devons contractual obligations
that would accelerate scheduled maturities should devons debt rating fall below
a specified level certain of devons agreements related to its oil and natural
gas hedges do contain provisions that could require devon to provide cash
collateral in situations where devons liability under the hedge is above a
certain dollar threshold and where devons debt rating is below investment grade
bbb or baa3 however devons liability under these agreements would only
exceed the threshold level in circumstances where the market prices for oil or
natural gas were rising it is unlikely that devons debt rating would be
subjected to downgrades to noninvestment grade levels during such a period of
rising oil and natural gas prices

     as summarized earlier in this section devons cost of borrowing under its
credit facilities and its 3 billion term loan facility is predicated on its
corporate debt rating therefore even though a ratings downgrade would not
accelerate scheduled maturities it would adversely impact devons interest rate
on its variable rate debt under the terms of the credit facilities and the term
loan credit facility a onenotch downgrade would increase devons fully drawn
borrowing rates by 25 basis points for each facility the average borrowing
costs for the credit facilities would increase from libor plus 95 basis points
to libor plus 120 basis points and the borrowing costs for the 3 billion term
loan facility would increase from libor plus 100 basis points to libor plus 125
basis points a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact devons ability to
economically access future debt markets

     as of january 31 2003 devon was not aware of any potential ratings
downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies

  contractual obligations

     a summary of devons contractual obligations as of december 31 2002 is

  pension obligations

     devon accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 87
employers accounting for pensions  under sfas 87 pension expense is
recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods
pension expense calculated under sfas 87 is generally independent of funding
decisions or requirements devon recognized expense for its defined benefit
pension plans of 16 million 7 million and 5 million in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively devon estimates that its pension expense will approximate 30
million in 2003

     as compared to the projected benefit obligation devons qualified and
nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by 179 million and 54
million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in the
underfunded amount during 2002 was primarily caused by additional underfunded
obligations assumed in the january 2002 mitchell acquisition losses on
investments and actuarial losses a detailed reconciliation of the 2002 activity
is included in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of
the 179 million underfunded status at the end of 2002 75 million is
attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan
assets however certain trusts have been established to assist devon in funding
the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans as of december 31 2002
these trusts had investments with a market value of 53 million the value of
these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in devons accompanying
consolidated balance sheets

     as compared to the accumulated benefit obligation devons qualified
defined benefit plans were underfunded by 82 million at december 31 2002 the
accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in
that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels devons
current intentions are to fund this accumulated benefit obligation deficit over
the twoyear period ending december 31 2004 the actual amount of contributions
required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan
assets and any changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period

     the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use
of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different
expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the
assumptions devon believes that the two most critical assumptions affecting
pension expense and liabilities are the expected longterm rate of return on
plan assets and the assumed discount rate

     devon assumed that its plan assets would generate a longterm weighted
average rate of return of 827 at december 31 2002 and 2001 and 85 at
december 31 2000 devon developed these expected longterm rate of return
assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well
as longterm inflation assumptions the expected longterm rate of return on
plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets
the target investment mix for devons plan assets are approximately 65 domestic
equities 15 international equities and 20 fixed income instruments

     devon believes that its longterm asset allocation on average will
approximate the targeted allocation devon regularly reviews its actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted
allocation when considered appropriate

     pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets
decreases a decrease in devons longterm rate of return assumption of 100
basis points from 827 to 727 would increase the expected 2003 pension
expense by approximately 3 million

     devon discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted average
rate of 672 at december 31 2002 compared to 710 at december 31 2001 and
765 at december 31 2000 the discount rate is determined at the end of each
year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled this
rate is based on highquality bond yields after allowing for call and default
risk
                                        45
page

devon considers high quality corporate bond yield indices such as moodys aa
when selecting the discount rate

     the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the
discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points from
672 to 647 would increase devons pension liability at december 31 2002
by approximately 14 million and increase its estimated 2003 pension expense by
approximately 2 million

     at december 31 2002 devon had unrecognized actuarial losses of 152
million these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in
future years devon estimates that approximately 10 million 9 million and 8
million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense
in 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively the 10 million estimated to be recognized
in 2003 is a component of the total estimated 2003 pension expense of 30
million referred to earlier in this discussion

     future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various
other factors related to the participants in devons defined benefit pension
plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities devon cannot predict
with certainty what these factors will be in the future

critical accounting policies

  full cost ceiling calculations

     devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
properties the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of
a ceiling or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized
on the balance sheet if devons capitalized costs are in excess of the
calculated ceiling the excess must be written off as an expense the ceiling
limitation is imposed separately for each country in which devon has oil and gas
properties

     devons discounted present value of its proved oil natural gas and ngl
reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the
component that requires the most subjective judgments estimates of reserves are
forecasts based on engineering data projected future rates of production and
the timing of future expenditures the process of estimating oil natural gas
and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment resulting in imprecise
determinations particularly for new discoveries different reserve engineers
may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data
certain of devons reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants while
other reserve estimates are prepared by devons engineers see note 14 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements

     the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding
estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect
updated information in the past four years devons annual revisions to its
reserve estimates have averaged approximately 3 of the previous years
estimate however there can be no assurance that more significant revisions
will not be necessary in the future if future significant revisions are
necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities it could result
in a full cost property writedown in addition to the impact of the estimates of
proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling estimates of proved reserves
are also a significant component of the calculation of dda

     while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment the
associated prices of oil natural gas and ngl reserves and the applicable
discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the
reserves do not require judgment the ceiling calculation dictates that prices
and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant
indefinitely therefore the future net revenues associated with the estimated
proved reserves are not based on devons assessment of future prices or costs
but rather are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each
quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed in calculating the ceiling
devon does not adjust the endofperiod price by the effect of cash flow hedges
in place

                                        46
page

     the ceiling calculation also dictates that a 10 discount factor is to be
used to calculate the present value of net cash flows

     because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the
last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires
a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair
value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been
cyclical and on any particular day at the end of a quarter can be either
substantially higher or lower than devons longterm price forecast that is a
barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that
result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by
fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the
ultimate value of the related reserves

     devon recorded writedowns to its canadian oil and gas properties as of june
30 2002 based on oil and natural gas cash market prices as of june 30 2002
devons canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by
371 million this aftertax amount resulted in a pretax reduction of the
carrying value of devons canadian oil and gas properties of 651 million in the
second quarter of 2002 this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in
canadian gas prices during the last half of june 2002 the end of june reference
prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation expressed in canadian dollars
based on an exchange ratio of 06585 were a nymex price of c4079 per barrel
of oil and an aeco price of c217 per mmbtu

     devon also recorded writedowns to its domestic and canadian oil and gas
properties as of december 31 2001 the domestic properties were reduced by 449
million and the canadian properties were reduced by 434 million the yearend
2001 prices used to calculate the ceiling were based on a nymex oil price of
1984 per barrel a henry hub gas price of 265 per mmbtu and an aeco gas
price of c367 per mmbtu

     if oil or gas prices at the end of future quarters drop below these june
30 2002 or december 31 2001 prices or if devon reduces its estimates of
proved reserve quantities further writedowns would likely occur

  fair values of derivative instruments

     the estimated fair values of devons derivative instruments are recorded on
devons consolidated balance sheets substantially all of devons derivative
instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas
production therefore while fair values of such hedging instruments must be
estimated as of the end of each reporting period the changes in the fair values
are not included in devons consolidated results of operations instead the
changes in fair value of hedging instruments are recorded directly to
stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are
produced

     the estimates of the fair values of devons hedging derivatives require
substantial judgment devon obtains forward price and volatility data for all
major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third
parties these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in
the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or
outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using devons current
borrowing rates under its revolving credit facilities in addition devon
estimates the option value of price floors and price caps using the
blackscholes option pricing model these pricing and discounting variables are
sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in forward prices regional
price differentials and interest rates

     as stated earlier substantially all of devons derivative instruments are
hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production devon is not
involved in any speculative trading activities of derivatives

  business combinations

     devon has grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of
other oil and natural gas companies most of these acquisitions have been
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

                                        47
page

and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will
be accounted for using the purchase method

     under the purchase method the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet
the estimated fair values of the acquired companys assets and liabilities any
excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill as of january 1 2002 the
accounting for goodwill has changed in prior years goodwill was amortized over
its estimated useful life as of 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized but
instead is assessed for impairment at least annually

     there are various assumptions made by devon in determining the fair values
of an acquired companys assets and liabilities the most significant
assumptions and the ones requiring the most judgment involve the estimated
fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired to determine the fair values
of these properties devon prepares estimates of oil natural gas and ngl
reserves these estimates are based on work performed by devons engineers and
that of outside consultants the judgments associated with these estimated
reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost
ceiling calculation

     however there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of
acquired oil natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than
that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation as stated above the full
cost ceiling calculation applies current price and cost information to the
reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount by contrast the fair value of
reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on devons estimates
of future oil natural gas and ngl prices devons estimates of future prices
are based on its own analysis of pricing trends these estimates are based on
current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand
dynamics such as economic growth forecasts they are also based on industry data
regarding natural gas storage availability drilling rig activity changes in
delivery capacity trends in regional pricing differentials and other
fundamental analysis future price forecasts from independent third parties are
noted when devon makes its pricing estimates

     devons estimates of future prices are applied to the estimated reserve
quantities acquired to arrive at estimates of future net revenues for estimated
proved reserves the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate
determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon
devons cost of capital

     devon also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair
value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination these unproved
reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves
because of their very nature probable and possible reserve estimates are more
imprecise than those of proved reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of
estimating and valuing unproved reserves the discounted future net revenues of
probable and possible reserves are reduced by what devon considers to be an
appropriate riskweighting factor in each particular instance it is common for
the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be
reduced by factors ranging from 30 to 80 to arrive at what devon considers to
be the appropriate fair values

     generally in devons business combinations the determination of the fair
values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair
values of other assets and liabilities the acquired companies commonly have
longterm debt that devon assumes in the acquisition and this debt must be
recorded at the estimated fair value as if devon had issued such debt however
significant judgment on devons behalf is usually not required in these
situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by
devons peer companies

     prior to the 2002 mitchell acquisition devons mergers and acquisitions
have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of
exploration development and production activities related to oil and gas
properties however in addition to exploration development and production
activities mitchells business also included substantial marketing and
midstream activities therefore a portion of the mitchell purchase price was
allocated to the fair value of mitchells marketing and midstream facilities and
equipment which consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and
natural gas pipeline systems

                                        48
page

     because the mitchell marketing and midstream assets primarily served gas
producing properties that were also acquired by devon from mitchell certain of
the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were
also integral to the value of the marketing and midstream assets for example
future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas
processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
unproved gas producing properties future expected prices for marketing and
midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those
used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell based on
historical costs and known trends and commitments devon also estimated future
operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at
estimated future cash flows these cash flows were discounted at rates
consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas
producing assets to arrive at devons estimated fair value of the marketing and
midstream facilities and equipment

  valuation of goodwill

     effective january 1 2002 devon adopted the remaining provisions of sfas
no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  under sfas no 142 goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are
instead tested for impairment at least annually this requires devon to estimate
the fair values of its own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the
process described above for a business combination therefore considerable
judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair
value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to
assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis

  impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted

     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations sfas no 143 requires liability recognition for retirement
obligations associated with tangible longlived assets such as producing well
sites offshore production platforms and natural gas processing plants the
obligations included within the scope of sfas no 143 are those for which a
company faces a legal obligation for settlement the initial measurement of the
asset retirement obligation is to be the discounted present fair value defined
as the price that an entity would have to pay a willing third party of
comparable credit standing to assume the liability in a current transaction
other than in a forced or liquidation sale

     the asset retirement cost equal to the discounted fair value of the
retirement obligation is to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related
longlived asset and allocated to expense using a systematic and rational
method

     devon will adopt sfas no 143 effective january 1 2003 using a cumulative
effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement
obligations asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation

     devon previously estimated costs of dismantlement removal site
reclamation and other similar activities in the total costs that are subject to
depreciation depletion and amortization however devon did not record a
separate asset or liability for such amounts upon adoption of sfas no 143 on
january 1 2003 devon expects to record a cumulativeeffecttype adjustment for
an increase to net earnings of between 10 million and 30 million net of
deferred tax expense of between 5 million and 15 million additionally devon
expects to establish an asset retirement obligation of between 425 million and
475 million an increase to property and equipment of between 375 million and
425 million and a decrease in accumulated dda of between 65 million and 95
million

     the fasb issued statement no 145 rescission of fasb statements no 4 44
and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections on april
30 2002 sfas no 145 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after may
15 2002 this statement rescinds sfas no 4 reporting gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt and requires that all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they
meet the criteria in apb no 30 applying apb no 30 will distinguish
transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that
are
                                        49

unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an
extraordinary item any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was
classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not
meet the criteria in apb no 30 for classification as an extraordinary item must
be reclassified devon early adopted the provisions related to sfas no 145
during the fourth quarter 2002 with the adoption of sfas no 145 a loss of 6
million resulting from extinguishment of debt in 1999 was reclassified from
extraordinary loss to interest expense and 1999s current income tax expense
was reduced by the 2 million tax benefit related to the loss from early
extinguishment

     the fasb issued statement no 146 accounting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities in june 2002 sfas no 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 943 liability recognition
for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity
including certain costs incurred in a restructuring sfas no 146 applies to
costs incurred in an exit activity which includes but is not limited to a
restructuring or a disposal activity covered by sfas no 144

     sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit
or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred previously
under issue 943 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an
entitys commitment to an exit plan statement no 146 also establishes that
fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability

     the provisions of sfas no 146 are effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 devon currently has no
such exit or disposal activities planned

     in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect
guarantees of indebtedness to others an interpretation of fasb statements no
5 57 and 107 and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 this
interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december
31 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on devons financial
statements the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements
of interim and annual periods ending after december 31 2002 and are included in
the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no
123  this statement amends fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased
compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee
compensation in addition this statement amends the disclosure requirements of
statement no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements certain of the disclosure modifications are required for
fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 and are included in the notes to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements

     in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of
variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin
no 51 interpretation no 46 requires a company to consolidate a variable
interest entity if the company has a variable interest or combination of
variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses
if they occur receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if
they occur or both a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that
significantly affect the results of the activities of a variable interest entity
is a strong indication that a company has one or both of the characteristics
that would require consolidation of the variable interest entity interpretation
no 46 also requires additional disclosures regarding variable interest
entities the new interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest
entities created after january 31 2003 and is effective in the first interim
or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 for variable interest entities
in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1
2003 devon owns no

2003 estimates

     the forwardlooking statements provided in this discussion are based on
managements examination of historical operating trends the information which
was used to prepare the december 31 2002 reserve reports of independent
petroleum engineers and other data in devons possession or available from third
parties devon cautions that its future oil natural gas and ngl production
revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally
incident to the exploration for and development production and sale of oil gas
and ngls these risks include but are not limited to price volatility
inflation or lack of availability of goods and services environmental risks
drilling risks regulatory changes the uncertainty inherent in estimating
future oil and gas production or reserves and other risks as outlined below
additionally devon cautions that its future marketing and midstream revenues
and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident
to the marketing and midstream business these risks include but are not
limited to price volatility environmental risks regulatory changes the
uncertainty inherent in estimating future processing volumes and pipeline
throughput cost of goods and services and other risks as outlined below also
the financial results of devons foreign operations are subject to currency
exchange rate risks additional risks are discussed below in the context of line
items most affected by such risks

  specific assumptions and risks related to price and production estimates

     prices for oil natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing
market conditions market conditions for these products are influenced by
regional and worldwide economic conditions weather and other local market
conditions these factors are beyond devons control and are difficult to
predict in addition to volatility in general devons oil gas and ngl prices
may vary considerably due to differences between regional markets
transportation availability and costs and demand for the various products
derived from oil natural gas and ngls substantially all of devons revenues
are attributable to sales processing and transportation of these three
commodities consequently devons financial results and resources are highly
influenced by price volatility

     estimates for devons future production of oil natural gas and ngls are
based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil gas and ngls will
continue at levels that allow for profitable production of these products there
can be no assurance of such stability also devons international production of
oil natural gas and ngls is governed by payout agreements with the governments
of the countries in which devon operates if the payout under these agreements
is attained earlier than projected devons net production and proved reserves
in such areas could be reduced

     estimates for devons future processing and transport of oil natural gas
and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil gas
and ngls will continue at levels that allow for profitable processing and
transport of these products there can be no assurance of such stability

     the production transportation processing and marketing of oil natural
gas and ngls are complex processes which are subject to disruption due to
transportation and processing availability mechanical failure human error
meteorological events including but not limited to hurricanes and numerous
other factors the following forwardlooking statements were prepared assuming
demand curtailment producibility and general market conditions for devons
oil natural gas and ngls during 2003 will be substantially similar to those of
2002 unless otherwise noted

     given the general limitations expressed herein following are devons
forwardlooking statements for 2003 unless otherwise noted all of the
following dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars amounts related to
canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using an exchange rate
of 065 us dollar to 100 canadian dollar the actual 2003 exchange rate may
vary materially from this estimated rate such variations could have a material
effect on the following estimates

     though devon has completed several major property acquisitions and
dispositions in recent years these transactions are opportunity driven thus
devon does not budget nor can it reasonably predict the timing or size of
such possible acquisitions or dispositions if any as discussed in note 16 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements on february 24 2003 devon
announced its intent to merge with ocean energy inc ocean the following
forwardlooking estimates do not include the additional revenues and expenses
that devon will report in 2003 if this merger is consummated

     set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates of devons
oil gas and ngl production for 2003 on a combined basis devon estimates its

this total approximately 92 is estimated to be produced from reserves
classified as proved at december 31 2002

     devon expects its oil production in 2003 to total between 354 and 372
mmbbls of this total approximately 92 is estimated to be produced from
reserves classified as proved at december 31 2002 the expected ranges of
production by area are as follows

  oil prices  floating

     devons 2003 average prices for each of its areas are expected to differ
from the nymex price as set forth in the following table the nymex price is the
monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for west texas

     devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and
ceiling price for a portion of its 2003 oil production that otherwise is subject
to floating prices the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic and
canadian oil production are based on the nymex price if the nymex price is
outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various
collars devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference
any such settlements will either increase or decrease devons oil revenues for
the period because devons oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ
from the nymex price due to differing quality ie sweet crude versus sour
crude and transportation costs from different

  marketing and midstream revenues and expenses

     devons marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily
from its natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines
these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors the factors
include but are not limited to changes in production from wells connected to
the pipelines and related processing plants changes in the absolute and
relative prices of natural gas and ngls provisions of the agreements and the
amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated
processing levels

     these factors coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl
prices increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and
midstream revenues and expenses given these

                                        54
page

uncertainties devon estimates that 2003 marketing and midstream revenues will
be between 118 billion and 125 billion and marketing and midstream expenses
will be between 961 million and 102 billion

  production and operating expenses

     devons production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses
transportation costs and production taxes these expenses vary in response to
several factors among the most significant of these factors are additions to or
deletions from devons property base changes in production tax rates changes
in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the
operation of the properties and the amount of repair and workover activity
required oil natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating
expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects

     given these uncertainties devon estimates that 2003 lease operating
expenses will be between 611 million and 649 million transportation costs
will be between 141 million and 150 million and production taxes will be
between 37 and 42 of consolidated oil natural gas and ngl revenues
excluding revenues related to hedges upon which production taxes are not
incurred

  depreciation depletion and amortization dda

     the 2003 oil and gas property dda rate will depend on various factors
most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be
added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2003 compared to the costs
incurred for such efforts and the revisions to devons yearend 2002 reserve
estimates that based on prior experience are likely to be made during 2003

     based on these uncertainties oil and gas property related dda expense for
2003 is expected to be between 11 billion and 12 billion additionally
devon expects its dda expense related to nonoil and gas property fixed assets
to total between 124 million and 132 million this range includes 78 million
to 83 million related to marketing and midstream assets based on these dda
amounts and the production estimates set forth earlier devon expects its
consolidated dda rate will be between 682 per boe and 722 per boe

  accretion of asset retirement obligation

     as discussed in the previous section titled impact of recently issued
accounting standards not yet adopted devon adopted sfas no 143 effective
january 1 2003 using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition
amounts for asset retirement obligations asset retirement costs and accumulated
depreciation sfas no 143 requires liability recognition for retirement
obligations associated with tangible longlived assets such as producing well
sites offshore production platforms and natural gas processing plants the
obligations included within the scope of sfas no 143 are those for which a
company faces a legal obligation for settlement the initial measurement of the
asset retirement obligation is to be the discounted present fair value defined
as the price that an entity would have to pay a willing third party of
comparable credit standing to assume the liability in a current transaction
other than in a forced or liquidation sale because the asset retirement
obligation is a discounted value accretion will be recognized as the estimated
date for settling the obligation draws closer

     as a result of the requirements of sfas no 143 devon expects its 2003
accretion of its asset retirement obligation related to the adoption of sfas 143
to be between 25 million and 35 million

  general and administrative expenses ga

     devons ga includes the costs of many different goods and services used in
support of its business these goods and services are subject to general price
level increases or decreases in addition devons ga varies with its level of
activity and the related staffing needs as well as with the amount of
professional services required during any given period should devons needs or
the prices of the required goods and services differ significantly from current
expectations actual ga could vary materially from

                                        55
page

the estimate given these limitations consolidated ga in 2003 is expected to
be between 215 million and 229 million

  interest expense

     future interest rates debt outstanding and oil natural gas and ngl prices
have a significant effect on devons interest expense devon can only marginally
influence the prices it will receive in 2003 from sales of oil natural gas and
ngls and the resulting cash flow these factors increase the margin of error
inherent in estimating future interest expense other factors which affect
interest expense such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures are
within devons control

     assuming no changes in fixedrate debt balances during 2003 devons
average balance of fixedrate debt during 2003 will be 65 billion the
interest expense in 2003 related to this fixedrate debt including net
accretion of related discounts will be approximately 472 million this
fixedrate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some but
not all of devons longterm debt devons floating rate debt is discussed in
the following paragraphs

     as of january 31 2003 devon had 11 billion outstanding under its
original 30 billion amortizing senior unsecured term loan credit facility
this credit facility which was entered into in october 2001 has a term of five
years this credit facility is nonrevolving

     the remaining balance outstanding as of january 31 2003 will mature as
follows

                                                                  1135
                                                                  


     this 3 billion facility includes various rate options which can be elected
by devon including a rate based on libor plus a margin the margin is based on
devons debt rating based on devons current debt rating the margin is 100
basis points as of january 31 2003 the average interest rate on this facility
was 23

     from time to time devon borrows under its 1 billion credit facilities
borrowings under the us facility currently set at 725 million may be
borrowed at various rate options including libor plus a margin with interest
periods of up to six months borrowings under the canadian facility currently
set at 275 million may be made at various rate options including libor plus a
margin with interest periods up to six months or bankers acceptances plus a
margin with interest periods of 30 to 180 days the current libor margin ranges
from 45 to 125 basis points based upon usage and the tranche utilized and the
current bankers acceptance margin is 725 basis points over the cost of funding
there were no borrowings under these facilities at january 31 2003

     devon also borrows under a 150 million canadian dollar letter of credit
facility which is primarily used to issue letters of credit in association with
devons canadian drilling commitments as of december 31 2002 there were 109
million canadian dollars of issued letters of credit under this facility devon
may also use this facility for general corporate purposes

     from time to time devon also borrows under its commercial paper facility
total borrowings under the 725 million us facility and the commercial paper
program cannot exceed 725 million there were no borrowings under the
commercial paper facility as of december 31 2002 commercial paper borrowing
costs are typically 20 to 50 basis points over libor debt outstanding under
this program is generally borrowed for seven to 90 day periods and may be
borrowed up to 365 days at prevailing commercial paper market rates

     devon has fixed the interest rate on 125 million canadian dollars and 50
million us dollars of its floating rate debt through swap agreements at
average rates of 64 and 59 respectively the canadian

                                        56
page

dollar swap agreements mature at various dates through july 2007 and the us
dollar swap agreement matures in may 2003

     devon has also entered into an interest rate swap on its 125 million 805
senior notes due in 2004 to swap a fixed interest rate for a variable interest
rate the variable interest rate on this instrument is based on libor plus a
margin of 336 basis points the interest rate swap is accounted for as a fair
value hedge under sfas 133

     devons interest expense totals have historically included payments of
facility and agency fees amortization of debt issuance costs the effect of the
interest rate swaps and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt
balances outstanding devon expects between 10 million and 20 million of such
items to be included in its 2003 interest expense based on the information
related to interest expense set forth herein and assuming no material changes in
devons levels of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates devon expects its
2003 interest expense will be between 512 million and 522 million

  reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties

     devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
properties under the full cost method devons net book value of oil and gas
properties less related deferred income taxes the costs to be recovered
may not exceed a calculated full cost ceiling the ceiling limitation is the
discounted estimated aftertax future net revenues from oil and gas properties
plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization the ceiling is imposed
separately by country in calculating future net revenues current prices and
costs are generally held constant indefinitely the costs to be recovered are
compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis if the costs to be recovered
exceed the ceiling the excess is written off as an expense an expense recorded
in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil
and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent
period

     because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the
last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely and requires
a 10 discount factor the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair
value of the reserves oil and natural gas prices have historically been
cyclical and on any particular day at the end of a quarter can be either
substantially higher or lower than devons longterm price forecast that is a
barometer for true fair value therefore oil and gas property writedowns that
result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation and that are caused by
fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
reserves should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the
ultimate value of the related reserves

     because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices it is not possible to
predict whether devon will incur a full cost writedown in future periods

  effects of changes in foreign currency rates

     devons canadian subsidiary has 400 million of fixedrate senior notes
which are denominated in us dollars changes in the exchange rate between the
us dollar and the canadian dollar during 2003 will increase or decrease the
canadian dollar equivalent balance of this debt such changes in the canadian
dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be included in determining
net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes because of the
variability of the exchange rate it is not possible to estimate the effect
which will be recorded in 2003 however based on the january 31 2003
canadiantous dollar exchange rate of 06540 for every 001 change in the
exchange rate devon will record an effect either income or expense of
approximately 9 million canadian dollars the resulting revenue or expense in
us dollars will depend on the currency exchange rate in effect throughout the
year

the actual amount of financial pretax earnings the tax rate for 2003 will be
significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pretax
earnings generated by us canadian and international operations due to the
different tax rates of each country there are certain tax deductions and
credits that will have a fixed impact on 2003s income tax expense regardless of
the level of pretax earnings that are produced given the uncertainty of its
pretax earnings amount devon estimates that its consolidated financial income
tax rate in 2003 will be between 20 and 40 the current income tax rate is
expected to be between 0 and 10 the deferred income tax rate is expected to
be between 20 and 30 significant changes in estimated capital expenditures
production levels of oil gas and ngls the prices of such products marketing
and midstream revenues or any of the various expense items could materially
alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2003s
financial income tax rates

year 2003 potential capital sources uses and liquidity

  capital expenditures

     though devon has completed several major property acquisitions in recent
years these transactions are opportunity driven thus devon does not budget
nor can it reasonably predict the timing or size of such possible acquisitions
if any as discussed in note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements on february 24 2003 devon announced its intention to merge with
ocean the following forwardlooking estimates do not include the additional
capital expenditures that devon will report in 2003 if this merger is
consummated

     devons capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future
oil natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital
additions should actual prices received differ materially from devons price
expectations for its future production some projects may be accelerated or
deferred and consequently may increase or decrease total 2003 capital
expenditures in addition if the actual costs of the budgeted items vary
significantly from the anticipated amounts actual capital expenditures could
vary materially from devons estimates

     given the limitations discussed devon expects its 2003 capital
expenditures for drilling and development efforts plus related facilities to
total between 14 billion and 16 billion these amounts include between 455
million and 525 million for drilling and facilities costs related to reserves
classified as proved as of yearend 2002 in addition these amounts include
between 485 million and 555 million for other low riskreward projects and
between 435 million and 510 million for new higher riskreward projects low
riskreward projects include development drilling that does not offset currently
productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production
from a known productive formation higher riskreward projects include
exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault
blocks or new reservoirs

     the following table shows expected drilling and production facilities

     in addition to the above expenditures for drilling and development devon
expects to spend between 150 million to 170 million on its marketing and
midstream assets which include its oil pipelines gas processing plants
treating facilities and gas pipelines devon also expects to capitalize between
85 million and 95 million of ga expenses in accordance with the full cost
method of accounting devon also expects to pay between 30 million and 40
million for plugging and abandonment charges and to spend between 50 million
and 60 million for other nonoil and gas property fixed assets

  other cash uses

     devons management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock
dividend to continue with the current 005 per share quarterly dividend rate
and 157 million shares of common stock outstanding 2003 dividends are expected
to approximate 31 million also devon has 150 million of 649 cumulative
preferred stock upon which it will pay 10 million of dividends in 2003

  capital resources and liquidity

     devons estimated 2003 cash uses including its drilling and development
activities are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of working
capital and operating cash flow the amount of operating cash flow to be
generated during 2003 is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and
expenses as previously cited however based upon current oil and gas price
expectations for 2003 devon anticipates that its operating cash flow will
exceed its planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the
year devon currently intends to accumulate any excess cash to fund future
years debt maturities additional alternatives could be considered based upon
the actual amount if any of such excess cash if significant acquisitions or
other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year devon could utilize
its existing credit facilities andor seek to establish and utilize other
sources of financing as of december 31 2002 devon had 975 million available
under its 1 billion credit facilities net of 25 million of outstanding
letters of credit



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     the primary objective of the following information is to provide
forwardlooking quantitative and qualitative information about devons potential
exposure to market risks the term market risk refers to the risk of loss
arising from adverse changes in oil gas and ngl prices interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise
indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably
possible losses this forwardlooking information provides indicators of how
devon views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures all of devons market
risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative
trading

  commodity price risk

     devons major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil
gas and ngls production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing
worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to its us and
canadian natural gas and ngl production pricing for oil gas and ngl production
has been volatile and unpredictable for several years

     devon periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to
a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through various
financial transactions which hedge the future prices received these
transactions include financial price swaps whereby devon will receive a fixed
price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract
counterparty and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for
the hedged production if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of
the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and
the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference these financial
hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at
targeted levels and to manage devons exposure to oil and gas price
fluctuations devon does not hold or issue derivative instruments for
speculative trading purposes

     devons total hedged positions as of january 31 2003 are set forth in the
following tables
                                        59
page

  price swaps

     through various price swaps devon has fixed the price it will receive on a
portion of its natural gas production in 2003 these swaps will result in a
fixed price of 323 per mcf on 97148 mcf per day of domestic production during
2003 where necessary the prices related to these swaps have been adjusted for
certain transportation costs that are netted against the price recorded by
devon and the price has also been adjusted for the btu content of the gas
production that has been hedged

  costless price collars

     devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and
ceiling price for a portion of its 2003 and 2004 oil and natural gas production
the following tables include information on these collars for each geographic
area the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic oil production are based
on nymex the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each
trading day for west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing
oklahoma the gas prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a
nymexbased price using devons estimates of differentials between nymex and
the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based the floor and
ceiling prices related to the domestic collars are based on various regional
firstofthemonth price indices as published monthly by inside ferc  the floor
and ceiling prices related to the canadian collars are based on the aeco index
as published by the canadian gas price reporter

     if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by
the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars devon and the counterparty
to the collars will settle the difference any such settlements will either
increase or decrease devons oil or gas revenues for the period because devons
gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the related regional
indices and due to differing btu content of gas production the floor and
ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devons
realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars

     the floor and ceiling prices in the following tables are weighted averages
of all the various collars

     devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical
effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair
value of its commodity hedging instruments at january 31 2003 a 10 increase
in the underlying commodities prices would have reduced the fair value of
devons commodity hedging instruments by 135 million

  fixedprice physical delivery contracts

     in addition to the commodity hedging instruments described above devon
also manages its exposure to oil and gas price risks by periodically entering
into fixedprice contracts

     devon has fixedprice physical delivery contracts for the years 2003
through 2011 covering canadian natural gas production ranging from 8 bcf to 16
bcf per year from 2012 through 2016 devon also has canadian gas volumes
subject to fixedprice contracts but the yearly volumes are less than 1 bcf

  interest rate risk

     at december 31 2002 devon had longterm debt outstanding of 76 billion
of this amount 65 billion or 85 bears interest at fixed rates averaging
7 the remaining 11 billion of debt outstanding bears interest at floating
rates which averaged 25

     the terms of devons various floating rate debt facilities revolving
credit facilities commercial paper and term loan credit facility allow
interest rates to be fixed at devons option for periods of between seven to 180
days a 10 increase in shortterm interest rates on the floatingrate debt
outstanding as of

                                        61
page

december 31 2002 would equal approximately 25 basis points such an increase in
interest rates would increase devons 2003 interest expense by approximately 3
million assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding for all of 2003

     devon assumed certain interest rate swaps as a result of the anderson
acquisition under these interest rate swaps devon has swapped a floating rate
for a fixed rate under such swaps devon will record a fixed rate of 63 on
98 million of debt in 2003 64 on 79 million of debt in 2004 through 2006
and 63 on 24 million of debt in 2007 the amount of gains or losses realized
from such swaps are included as increases or decreases to interest expense

     devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical
effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of its interest
rate swap instruments at january 31 2003 a 10 increase in the underlying
interest rates would have increased the fair value of devons interest rate
swaps by 2 million

     the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts
receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the shortterm
maturity of such instruments

  foreign currency risk

     devons net assets net earnings and cash flows from its canadian
subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in
the canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities of the canadian
subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate
as of the end of a reporting period revenues expenses and cash flow are
translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period

     as a result of the anderson acquisition devons canadian subsidiary devon
canada assumed 400 million of fixedrate longterm debt that is denominated in
us dollars changes in the currency conversion rate between the canadian and
us dollars between the beginning and end of a reporting period increase or
decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars required to repay the notes
the amount of such increase or decrease is required to be included in
determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes a
003 decrease in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would cause devon to
record a charge of approximately 20 million in 2003 the 400 million becomes
due in march 2011 until then the gains or losses caused by the exchange rate
fluctuations have no effect on cash flow

     devon assumed certain foreign currency exchange rate swaps in the anderson
acquisition a portion of devons canadian gas sales are based on us dollar
prices therefore currency fluctuations between the canadian and us dollars
impacts the amount of canadian dollars received by devons canadian subsidiaries
for this gas production these foreign currency exchange rate swaps mitigate the
effect of volatility in the canadiantous dollar exchange rate on canadian
gas revenues under these swap agreements in 2003 devon will sell 12 million
at average canadiantous exchange rates of 0676 and buy the same amount of
dollars at the floating exchange rate the amount of gains or losses realized
from such swaps are included as increases or decreases to realized gas sales at
the december 31 2002 exchange rate these swaps would result in a decrease to
gas sales during 2003 of approximately 1 million a further 003 decrease in
the canadiantous dollar exchange rate would result in an additional decrease
to 2003 gas sales of approximately 1 million

     for purposes of the sensitivity analysis described above for changes in the
canadian dollar exchange rate a change in the rate of 003 was used as opposed
to a 10 change in the rate during the last ten years the canadiantous
dollar exchange rate has fluctuated an average of approximately 4 per year and
no years fluctuation was greater than 7 the 003 change used in the above
analysis represents an approximate 4 change in the yearend 2002 rate
