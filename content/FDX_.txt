vehicle electrification 

we are leveraging various innovative technologies to transition our pickupanddelivery and lastmile fleets to electric vehicles we plan to transition the entire fedex parcel pickupanddelivery fleet to zeroemission electric vehicles by calendar 2040 using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles for example by calendar 2025 we expect 50 of fedex express global pickupanddelivery vehicle purchases will be electric rising to 100 of all purchases by calendar 2030 subject to availability

aircraft fuel conservation and fleet modernization 

to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated ghg emissions we have implemented efficiencies in flight operations through our global fedex fuel sense program and are replacing many of our older airplanes with more fuelefficient models our team members remain committed to improving our fuel efficiency and reducing our environmental impact which led to 65 million gallons of jet fuel savings from our fedex fuel sense program in 2021 additionally we are modernizing our aircraft fleet to reduce costs enhance reliability and operational adaptability improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions we retired our md1010 fleet at the end of 2021 and plan to retire our md1030 fleet during 2023 we took delivery of four boeing 777 freighter “b777f” aircraft in 2022 and plan to deploy an additional eight b777f aircraft between 2023 and 2025 similarly we took delivery of 12 boeing 767300 freighter “b767f” aircraft in 2022 and plan to deploy an additional 38 b767f aircraft between 2023 and 2025 delays could impact these timelines we are also deploying 30 new atr 72600f aircraft for shorter feeder routes to replace our aging atr42 aircraft and introducing 50 cessna skycourier 408 cargo aircraft to help reduce the number of planes needed per feeder route and further improve our fuel efficiency 

a global increase in shipping volume exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic delayed the retirement of certain older aircraft and led us to fall short of our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30 from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2020 due to the increased demand for essential deliveries ecommerce and other global shipments in 2021 our aircraft emissions increased 12 compared to our 2020 performance however we have reduced our overall aircraft emissions intensity by 27 since 2005

the “fedex” trademark service mark and trade name are essential to our worldwide business fedex fedex express fedex ground fedex freight fedex services fedex office fedex logistics fedex dataworks fedex trade networks transport  brokerage fedex supply chain fedex custom critical and shoprunner among others are trademarks service marks and trade names of federal express corporation or the respective companies for which registrations or applications for registration are on file as applicable we have authorized through licensing arrangements the use of certain of our trademarks service marks and trade names by our contractors and global service participants to support our business in addition we license the use of certain of our trademarks service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness 

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report for discussion of regulations related to pilots including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations that could affect our business 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates routes and services in interstate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

 22  

 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by us and foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission “fcc” regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications and also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process the fcc recently expanded the use of the 37 to 42 gigahertz “ghz” spectrum band which has historically been reserved for aviation to support the implementation of “5g” cellular networks across the us in december 2021 following concerns of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters by the expanded use of the 37 to 42 ghz spectrum band the faa issued airworthiness directives prohibiting us aircraft operators from operating at us airports affected by 5g cellular networks unless authorized via an alternative means of compliance fedex express’s us air operations have continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the faa’s issuance of alternative means of compliance based on voluntary mitigations agreed to by the telecommunication companies implementing 5g cellular networks while the voluntary mitigations remain in effect as of july 18 2022 the telecommunication companies are expected to fully implement 5g cellular networks over the course of the next calendar year accordingly it is possible that the faa may take additional action to address aviation safety concerns related to 5g implementation which could adversely affect fedex express’s us domestic air operations we continue to engage with the faa and other industry stakeholders on this issue 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements 

compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change for example the eu has established the emissions trading system “ets” to regulate ghg emissions in the eu and adopted a directive in 2008 requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operations efforts by the eu in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended its stay on the extraterritorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to and from the european economic area “eea” through the end of calendar 2023 contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” 

 23  

 

in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting corsia which is a global marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the icao’s goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades technology operations and sustainable aviation fuel in june 2018 the icao adopted standards pertaining to countrybycountry implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019 in furtherance of these efforts in 2019 the faa issued notice of a corsia program enabling us carriers to submit emissions data used to set the initial global industry emissions baseline beginning in calendar 2021 requirements commenced for carriers subject to corsia to offset international aviation emissions above the industry baseline by purchasing and retiring eligible carbon credits andor utilizing sustainable aviation fuel in response to the creation of the corsia program in december 2017 the eu adopted a proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ets flights operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021 the eu has indicated that it will assess corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets as applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expenses the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors including the number of our flights subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of icaoeligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by fedex 

additionally in calendar 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in 2017 icao adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020 but also to new deliveries of current inproduction aircraft types from calendar 2023 additionally a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted these standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons in 2021 the epa adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emissions standards which are aligned with the 2017 icao emissions standards in the past the us congress has also considered bills that would regulate ghg emissions and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future in 2021 the us reentered the paris climate accord an agreement among 197 countries to reduce ghg emissions the effect of the reentry on future us policy regarding ghg emissions and on other ghg regulation is uncertain additionally the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business 

we are also subject to international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment fedex express has an environmental management system based on international standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and minimize our operational environmental footprint 

export controls  in recent years the us government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to us export control regulations such regulations can restrict the types of items that fedex customers are permitted to ship to certain entities and in some instances may prohibit fedex from serving certain entities altogether violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties for example the export control reform act of 2018 the “ecra” and its implementing regulations the export administration regulations the “ears” hold carriers such as fedex strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations violations of the ecra can result in criminal penalties of up to 1 million and civil penalties of 305000 or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs however the heightened focus on export controls by the us government increases fedex’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs 

in june 2019 fedex filed suit in us district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the us department of commerce the “doc” from enforcing prohibitions contained in the ears against fedex fedex believes that the ears violate common carriers’ rights to due process under the fifth amendment of the us constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations in september 2020 the court granted the doc’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit in november 2020 we appealed this decision on july 8 2022 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit 

customs  our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

 24  

 

labor  all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the national labor relations board “nlrb” have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees and employees of service providers contracting with fedex ground to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these and other potential labor law changes see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report 

data protection  there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection use retention transfer and processing of personal data in the us at both the state and federal level and internationally for more information regarding data protection regulation see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report

 item 1a ris k factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business results of operations financial condition and the price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business results of operations financial condition and the price of our common stock 

macroeconomic and market risks 

we are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments while macroeconomic risks apply to most companies we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity our primary business is to transport goods so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade — key macroeconomic measurements influenced by among other things inflation and deflation supply chain disruptions interest rates and currency exchange rates labor costs and unemployment levels fuel and energy prices public health crises inventory levels buying patterns and disposable income debt levels and credit availability when individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods we transport fewer goods and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers we transport goods shorter distances certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent macroeconomic geopolitical and public health developments additionally consumer spending has shifted from goods to services we expect these trends to continue further we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels 

moreover given the nature of our business and our global operations political economic and other conditions in foreign countries and regions including international taxes governmenttogovernment relations the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets and geopolitical risks such as the current conflict between russia and ukraine may adversely affect our business and results of operations we have suspended all services in ukraine russia and belarus which has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our business or results of operations the broader consequences of this conflict which may include further sanctions embargoes regional instability and geopolitical shifts airspace bans relating to certain routes or strategic decisions to alter certain routes potential retaliatory action by the russian government against companies including us as a result of the suspension of services in russia including nationalization of foreign businesses in russia increased tensions between the united states and countries in which we operate and the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy cannot be predicted 

to the extent the current conflict between russia and ukraine adversely affects our business it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this annual report any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations such risks include but are not limited to disruptions to our global technology infrastructure including through cyberattack ransom attack or cyberintrusion adverse changes in international trade policies our ability to maintain or increase our prices including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs our ability to implement and execute our business strategy particularly with regard to our fedex express international business disruptions in global supply chains which can limit the access of fedex and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and constraints volatility or disruption in the capital markets 

geopolitical uncertainty negatively impacted operations at fedex express in 2022 we expect slowing economic conditions during 2023 additionally we incurred higher costs due to labor market challenges in 2022 and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2023 for more information see “our failure to attract and retain employee talent or maintain our company culture as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations” below and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report 

 26  

 

additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations the us government has taken certain actions that have negatively impacted us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the us additionally several foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the us these actions contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years any further changes in us or international trade policy including tariffs export controls quotas embargoes or sanctions could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and further increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay tariffs or other antitrade measures increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose such measures political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

additionally the us government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain circumstances and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions furthermore given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign governments may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

our transportation businesses are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel costs to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information as of may 31 2022 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higheryielding express services to our loweryielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether in addition disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation networks the following factors may impact fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries economic sanctions imposed against oilproducing countries or specific industry participants changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns cyberattacks and public and investor sentiment several of these factors combined to constrain fuel supply and increase prices in 2022 and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2023 

operating risks 

a significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or results of operations our ability to attract and retain customers to efficiently operate our businesses and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication security and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion by computer hackers foreign governments cyber terrorists and activists cyber criminals malicious employees or other insiders of fedex or thirdparty service providers and other groups and individuals data breaches of companies and governments continue to increase as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we our customers and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems additionally risks such as code anomalies “acts of god” transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platforms data leakage cyberfraud and human error pose a direct threat to our products services systems and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

 27  

 

the technology infrastructure of acquired businesses as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition see “failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer” below for additional information on risks related to shoprunner and fedex dataworks 

we also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties including our customers and thirdparty service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services such third parties may host process or have access to information we maintain about our company customers employees and vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services like us these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems we have security processes protocols and standards in place including contractual provisions requiring such security measures that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access as a result of their engagements with us nevertheless a cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third parties’ security measures allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customers employees and vendors or disrupt our operations these third parties may also experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

a disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer systems and websites could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operations customer service and results of operations additionally a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by fedex or a trusted third party we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives informationtechnology risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans including investments to retire and replace endoflife systems the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent intense and sophisticated despite our efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches technology disruptions data loss and cyberfraud which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations see “item 1a risk factors” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended may 31 2021 for information regarding the 2017 notpetya cyberattack at tnt express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 2018 additionally we have experienced continual attempts by cyber criminals some of which have been successful to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network none of these fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to fedex 

while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise see “our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection” below for additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection 

the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and financial condition is highly unpredictable since late 2020 the covid19 pandemic has had varying impacts on the demand for our services our business operations and the global economy and supply chains there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread in certain regions of the world and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business and government shutdowns and other restrictions this uncertainty is expected to continue to impact our business in 2023 

the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our operating results in 2022 global recovery from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic slowed with the onset of new variants which resulted in reduced shipping demand and caused network disruptions particularly at fedex express our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which has required us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during the pandemic if we are unable to remain agile and continue to flex our networks to align with shipping volumes customer needs disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies market demands and operating conditions or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies for the duration of a prolonged period of economic recovery our business operations could be negatively impacted which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations 

 28  

 

we have also incurred increased operating expenses related to personal protective equipment and medicalsafety supplies as well as additional security and cleaning services in order to protect our team members and customers due to the size scope and geographically dispersed nature of our operations the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employees may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries 

additionally a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic our business operations may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects on our business if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure 

the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as the global economy will be dictated by future developments that remain uncertain and cannot be predicted such as its duration and spread the success of efforts to contain it and treat its impact the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the impact of actions taken in response resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate the future rate of ecommerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition such risks include but are not limited to additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations our ability to implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs our ability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired businesses changes in the business and financial soundness of the usps our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 and the impact of litigation or claims from customers team members suppliers regulators or other third parties relating to the covid19 pandemic or our actions in response to the pandemic 

for more information about the covid19 pandemic and its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results” of this annual report 

we are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us we are selfinsured up to certain limits that vary by type of risk for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims vehicle accidents property and cargo loss general business liabilities and benefits paid under employee disability programs our selfinsurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims frequency and volume of claims healthcare inflation seasonality and plan designs which may be subject to a high degree of variability however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known which may be several years material increases in the magnitude of claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity insurance retention levels judgment and settlement amounts associated legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates as a result our insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition during 2022 higher selfinsurance accruals negatively impacted our results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information 

as a supplement to our selfinsurance program we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we selfinsure periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance risk volatility and premium expense although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or socalled “nuclear” verdicts including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families such as the recently affirmed award by a new mexico state court jury in a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit against fedex ground discussed below given this recent trend it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits if any other claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage we would bear the excess in addition to our other selfinsured amounts

given the current claims environment the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently accordingly our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase or we could further increase our selfinsured retention as policies are renewed or replaced in 2015 a jury awarded compensatory damages of approximately 160 million to plaintiffs in connection with a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit filed against fedex ground in new mexico state court the award was subsequently affirmed by the new mexico court of appeals and ultimately by the new mexico supreme court in may 2022 while our insurance carriers have funded the approximately 160 million base judgment in excess of fedex ground’s 75 million selfinsured retention and insurance deductible we are currently pursuing insurance coverage for reimbursement of approximately 210 million of pre and postjudgment interest see note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report for more information our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided 

the transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses including those in the transportation industry these security requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations for example the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements additionally the icao’s standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine without government oversight which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on allcargo aircraft was modified effective july 1 2021 as a result we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant moreover a terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services 

strategic risks 

failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer we are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our longterm business strategy such as investments in fleet and facility modernization and strategic investments to increase collaboration and automation and improve productivity network efficiencies and safety additionally we are executing initiatives to use data to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members as well as to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe see “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for additional information 

such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses we have also incurred and may continue to incur increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy we may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies cost savings and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions for example in 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in europe the execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations the actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates if we are not able to successfully implement this plan our future financial results may suffer 

changes in our business strategy may also expose us to new and heightened risks for example shoprunner which we acquired in 2020 collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers its partners consumers with whom it has a direct relationship and users of its applications additionally it uses thirdparty service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers these service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data including payment information andor other confidential information the foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach developing privacy legislation within the us may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data within and among fedex dataworks shoprunner and the other fedex operating companies 

 30  

 

further in developing our business strategy we make certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers the future rate of ecommerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other conditions may be different from our assumptions as technology customer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences our future financial results will suffer for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “strategy” 

we may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial performance goals in june 2022 we announced that fedex is targeting certain financial performance goals for fiscal 2025 our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors including the other risk factors described in this section if we are not able to achieve these goals the price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

we depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes highquality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable assets in addition we have a strong reputation among customers team members and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing and recruitment tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business such as customer service mishaps accidents catastrophes or incidents involving aircraft vehicles or facilities operated by us low service or safety levels data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions noncompliance with laws the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law our advertising campaigns sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social media outlets such as facebook youtube instagram twitter and tiktok adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups including our customers and team members damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services andor create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

changes in the business or financial soundness of the usps including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of fedex express could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation services for the usps’s first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps’s international delivery service see “item 1 business” of this annual report under “fedex express segment” for more information 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the usps additionally the usps continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations the usps is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of fedex express and other transportation providers which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022 the difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the usps’s business including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations network volume levels service offerings service commitments or pricing could have additional negative impacts on our revenue results of operations and financial condition further a decision by the usps to terminate early or not renew its contract with fedex express for domestic services which expires in september 2024 would negatively impact our profitability 

we face intense competition the transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capitalintensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs in addition some highvolume package shippers are developing and implementing inhouse delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share for example amazoncom has established a network of hubs aircraft and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties see “item 1 business” of this annual report for additional information 

 31  

 

we believe we compete effectively with these companies — for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels more effectively bundle their services or offer services at lower prices it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition moreover if highvolume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide it may reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations these impacts could be exacerbated if highvolume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties news regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively impact the price of our common stock 

additionally advancements in technology such as advanced safety systems automated package sorting handling and delivery autonomous delivery thirdparty supply chain insight and management vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicles and digitization of freight services may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments 

our businesses are capital intensive and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels we make significant investments in aircraft package handling facilities vehicles technology sort equipment and other assets to support our transportation and business networks we also make significant investments to rebrand integrate and grow the companies that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes overcapacity could lead to belowmarket asset dispositions or writedowns as well as negatively impact operating margins and undercapacity could negatively impact service levels 

our inability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments form joint ventures or strategic alliances and realize the expected benefits from these transactions we regularly acquire businesses enter into strategic alliances and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial customer accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resources cultural and other risks including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies additionally we may be required to make significant capital expenditures andor incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions which may be higher than initially expected for example existing and future customer data in the systems and business of fedex and shoprunner may not be immediately interoperable or may not be interoperable without significant added expense in addition we are currently in the process of migrating customers from services offered by tnt express to the fedex express portfolio of services 

while we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and longterm profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses including their goodwill or other intangible assets we have previously incurred goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions some of which have been material and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future 

our autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks as discussed further in “item 1 business” under “fedex services segment—customerdriven technology—autonomous delivery technology” we are exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within our operations autonomous delivery is a new and evolving market which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance growth the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and other trends this aspect of our business strategy is subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including the ability to continue to develop autonomous delivery software and hardware access to sufficient capital our ability to develop and maintain necessary partnerships risks related to the manufacture of autonomous devices and significant competition from other companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous delivery technologies than we do 

in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous delivery devices on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous delivery devices occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny further regulation and reputational damage any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects

human resource management risks 

our failure to attract and retain employee talent or maintain our company culture as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our highquality employees many of whom are longstanding fedex team members difficulties in motivating rewarding recruiting and retaining employee talent including successors to members of senior management the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base andor our inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations reputation and the price of our common stock certain positions at fedex have historically experienced high turnover rates which can lead to increased recruiting training and retention costs additionally our company culture is important to providing highquality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operations and other factors if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive ability and our business may be harmed 

our business is labor intensive in nature and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of qualified persons in the markets where we and our contracted service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets prevailing wage rates and other benefits health and other insurance costs inflation behavioral changes adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations including increased minimum wage requirements or government programs safety levels of our operations our reputation within the labor market the continuing effect of the covid19 pandemic and variant strains the availability of child care and vaccine mandates that may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate labor market challenges contributed to global supply chain disruptions and affected the availability and cost of labor resulting in network inefficiencies higher purchased transportation costs and higher wage rates in 2022 we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2023 see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can hinder our ability to execute our business strategy negatively impact service levels and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationships with our employees and avoid having labor organizations organize groups of our employees our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions other than the pilots at fedex express and drivers at one fedex freight inc facility our us employees have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in 2015 which already had a small number of employees who are members of unions additionally certain of fedex express’s nonus employees are unionized in june 2022 the transport workers union filed an application with the national mediation board requesting an election to represent approximately 130 goc specialists who perform flight dispatching functions in fedex express’s goc center fedex express has raised objections to the application in its response in 2022 labor unions attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized and in certain instances were successful such attempts could continue in 2023 

our collective bargaining agreement with the alpa which represents the pilots of fedex express became amendable in november 2021 bargaining for a successor agreement began in may 2021 and continues while collective bargaining agreements under the rla which covers the pilots at fedex express do not expire we may be unable to maintain certain favorable terms included in the current collective bargaining agreement following negotiations with the alpa our inability to successfully reach new collective bargaining agreements with the alpa and other unions representing fedex employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” such legislation could expose our customers to the type of service disruptions that the rla was designed to prevent — local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of timesensitive highvalue goods throughout our global network such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets 

 33  

 

there is also the possibility that congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies such as fedex ground and fedex freight whose employees are governed by the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees as well as our vendor and supplier workforces to organize under the rla or nlra finally changes to federal or state laws regulations rules judicial or administrative precedent or guidance governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground’s service providers as independent employers of drivers if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service providers labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlays and experience adverse impacts to service levels 

fedex ground contracts with service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickupanddelivery operations and the status of these service providers as direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged we are defending jointemployer cases where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by service providers engaged by fedex ground we incur certain costs including legal fees in defending the status of service providers engaged by fedex ground as direct employers of their drivers we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses however adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory developments could among other things entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service providers and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground 

proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us  in 2010 the faa proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to allcargo air carriers when the faa issued final regulations in 2011 the “2011 regulations” allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new requirements instead allcargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation in 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of allcargo carriers from the 2011 regulations and litigation in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the faa’s decision however this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups and the us congress is currently considering legislation that if adopted would require allcargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability 

increasing costs the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits especially pension and healthcare benefits could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees these programs include defined benefit pension plans defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans the costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions such as discount rates investment returns on plan assets salary increases expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity additionally the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex involve numerous assumptions and can produce volatility in our results of operations financial condition and liquidity for example our fourth quarter marktomarket “mtm” retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pretax noncash loss of 13 billion in 2022 10 billion net of tax or 376 per diluted share and a gain of 12 billion in 2021 936 million net of tax or 348 per diluted share for additional information on our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—retirement plans mtm adjustments” and note 14 of the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report

environmental climate and weather risks 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emissions especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions could impose substantial costs on us especially at fedex express these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change including corsia and the paris climate accord see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” we may also incur additional expenses as a result of us and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding ghg emissions 

moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air express services finally given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems 

we may be unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 in 2021 we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification development of sustainable customer solutions identification and investment in alternative fuels fuel conservation and aircraft modernization programs and investments in our facilities and natural carbon sequestration 

execution of these strategies and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to successfully implement our business strategy effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions the availability and cost and our ability to acquire alternative fuel vehicles alternative fuels fuelefficient aircraft global electrical charging infrastructure offsite renewable energy and other materials and components unforeseen production design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration andor other related processes compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to ghg emissions carbon costs or climaterelated goals laborrelated regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures 

there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations failure to achieve our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships further given investors’ increased focus related to environmental social and governance matters such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of fedex common stock and limit our access to financing such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

our inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely impact our business and results of operations while we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes volcanoes wildfires hurricanes tornadoes floods severe winter weather conflicts or unrest terrorist attacks or other disturbances actual or threatened additionally shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our fedex express memphis world hub or one of our informationtechnology centers could adversely impact our business and results of operations we also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions moreover resulting economic dislocations including supply chain and fuel disruptions could adversely impact demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 35  

 

other legal regulatory and miscellaneous risks 

government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal state and local and nonus government regulations laws policies and actions there can be no assurance that such regulations laws policies and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services subject us to escalating costs or require us to modify our business models and objectives harming our financial results in particular legislative regulatory or other actions that us and nonus governments have undertaken or are considering in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty the use of new technology taxes foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions trade controls tariffs quotas embargoes or sanctions in the us or other countries complex economic sanctions import and export controls customs standards additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements labor and employment standards including with respect to our pilots and benefits government contracting regulated commodities environmental standards and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition capital requirements effective tax rate and service levels for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” additionally the current us presidential administration and various us federal and state regulatory bodies have indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing laws regulations and enforcement priorities and strategies that could among other things lead to comprehensive tax reform broadly increase the us minimum wage to 15 per hour make it easier for unions to organize our us employees and alter the employment relationship between service providers engaged by fedex ground and the drivers employed by those service providers 

we could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities and our effective tax rate us and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies including statutory tax rates global minimum taxes such as the framework agreed to by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development in 2022 digital taxes and transactions between affiliated companies such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed significant judgments estimates and calculations to be made and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced 

standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—income taxes” of this annual report for information regarding the lawsuit we filed in 2021 challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection use retention transfer and processing of personal data in the us at both the state and federal level and internationally including the eu’s general data protection regulation the california privacy rights act the virginia consumer data protection act and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions in addition china and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection laws regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation including in some instances class action litigation fines sanctions or other penalties which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging based on discretionary factors and difficult to predict consequently compliance with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our business including significantly expanded compliance burdens costs and enforcement risks require us to make extensive system or operational changes or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time see “failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer” above for additional information on data protection risks related to shoprunner and fedex dataworks

the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may impact our operations and increase our operating costs our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the dot and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks further our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and relations 

we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures in order to comply highprofile accidents catastrophes or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements these requirements can be issued with little or no notice or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether further our business may be adversely impacted when government agencies cease to operate as expected including due to partial shutdowns sequestrations or similar events which may result in among other things disruption in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” 

we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties including 

 

• widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or any other public health crisis 

 

• the united kingdom’s exit from the eu “brexit” including the economic operational regulatory and financial impacts of any postbrexit trade deal between the united kingdom and eu 

 

• the increasing costs of compliance with federal state and foreign governmental agency mandates including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies 

 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar australian dollar japanese yen and mexican peso which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices 

 

• any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against classaction derivative and other litigation such as wageandhour joint employment securities vehicle accident and discrimination and retaliation claims claims related to our mandatory and voluntary reporting and disclosure of climate change and other esg topics and any other legal or governmental proceedings including the matters discussed in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report 

 

• the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary informationtechnology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization 

 

• disruptions in global supply chains which can limit the access of fedex and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs 

 

• governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure which could increase our costs and adversely impact our service levels due to traffic congestion prolonged closure of key thoroughfares or suboptimal routing of our vehicles and aircraft 

 

• stockholder activism which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business hinder execution of our business strategy give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly and 

 

• constraints volatility or disruption in the capital markets our ability to maintain our current credit ratings commercial paper ratings and senior unsecured debt and passthrough certificate credit ratings and our ability to meet credit agreement financial covenants

description of business segments 

we provide a broad portfolio of transportation ecommerce and business services through companies competing collectively operating collaboratively and innovating digitally under the respected fedex brand our primary operating companies are federal express corporation “fedex express” the world’s largest express transportation company fedex ground package system inc “fedex ground” a leading north american provider of smallpackage ground delivery services and fedex freight corporation “fedex freight” a leading north american provider of lessthantruckload “ltl” freight transportation services these companies represent our major service lines and along with fedex corporate services inc “fedex services” constitute our reportable segments our fedex services segment provides sales marketing information technology communications customer service technical support billing and collection services and certain backoffice functions that support our operating segments the operating costs of the fedex services segment are allocated to the business units it serves see “reportable segments” for further discussion and refer to “item 1 business” for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies 

the key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include 

• the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy 

• the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size 

• the mix of services purchased by our customers 

• the prices we obtain for our services primarily measured by yield revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for ltl freight shipments 

• our ability to manage our cost structure capital expenditures and operating expenses to match shifting volume levels and 

• the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges 

many of our operating expenses are directly impacted by revenue and volume levels and we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a yearoveryear basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes therefore the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends impacting expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and volumes the line item “other operating expense” includes costs associated with outside service contracts such as facility services and cargo handling temporary labor and security insurance professional fees and operational supplies 

except as otherwise specified references to years indicate our fiscal year ended may 31 2022 or ended may 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year references to our transportation segments include collectively the fedex express segment the fedex ground segment and the fedex freight segment

results of o perations and outlook 

consolidated results 

the following table compares summary operating results dollars in millions except per share amounts for the years ended may 31 

 

  

the following table shows changes in revenue and operating results by reportable segment for 2022 compared to 2021 in millions 

 1 the following is a summary of the effects of the costs benefits of certain items affecting our financial results for the years ended may 31 in millions 

 overview 

we experienced revenue and operating income growth in 2022 resulting from yield management actions including the favorable net impact of fuel at all of our transportation segments in addition our results were positively affected by a mix shift to our higher yielding services due to strategic actions to improve revenue quality lower variable incentive compensation expense as well as severe winter weather experienced in the prior year also benefited yearoveryear operating income in 2022 

 46  

 

our operating results for 2022 were negatively affected by the coronavirus “covid19” pandemic labor market challenges and inflationary cost pressures labor market challenges contributed to global supply chain disruptions and affected the availability and cost of labor resulting in network inefficiencies higher purchased transportation costs and higher wage rates in addition global recovery from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic slowed with the onset of new variants which resulted in reduced shipping demand and caused network disruptions particularly at fedex express during 2022 

our 2022 results include business realignment costs of 278 million 214 million net of tax or 080 per diluted share associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe announced in 2021 see the “business realignment costs” section of this mda for more information our 2022 results also include a 210 million charge 160 million net of tax of 060 per diluted share recognized in the fourth quarter related to pre and postjudgment interest in connection with a fedex ground legal matter the amount is included in “corporate other and eliminations” see note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information 

we incurred tnt express integration expenses totaling 132 million 103 million net of tax or 039 per diluted share in 2022 a decrease of 78 million from 2021 the integration expenses are predominantly incremental costs directly associated with the integration of tnt express primarily related to professional and legal fees internal salaries and wages are included only to the extent the individuals are assigned fulltime to integration activities these costs were recognized at fedex express and fedex corporation the identification of these costs as integrationrelated expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures integration expenses do not include costs associated with our business realignment activities discussed above 

consolidated net income includes a pretax noncash loss of 16 billion in 2022 12 billion net of tax or 449 per diluted share and a gain of 12 billion in 2021 895 million net of tax or 333 per diluted share associated with our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments see the “retirement plans mtm adjustments” section of this mda and note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

consolidated net income in 2021 also includes a loss on debt extinguishment of 393 million 297 million net of tax or 111 per diluted share associated with our capital allocation strategy which includes reducing outstanding debt see the “other income and expense” section of this mda and note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

net income for 2022 includes a 142 million 053 per diluted share tax benefit related to revisions of prior year estimates identified during the preparation of us and foreign tax returns in 2021 we recognized a tax benefit of 279 million 104 per diluted share related to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” which allows tax losses to be offset against income from prior years that was taxed at higher rates and a tax benefit of 66 million 025 per diluted share from a tax rate increase in the netherlands applied to our deferred tax asset balances see the “income taxes” section of this mda and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in december 2021 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to 5 billion of fedex common stock in addition to a 25 million share repurchase program authorized in 2016 and we entered into an accelerated share repurchase “asr” agreement with a bank to repurchase an aggregate of 15 billion of our common stock share repurchases had a benefit of 013 per diluted share in 2022 see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the “financial condition—liquidity” section of this mda for additional information on our repurchase programs defined below

 49  

 

revenue 

revenue increased 11 in 2022 primarily due to yield management actions including higher fuel surcharges as well as commercial and home delivery volume growth at fedex ground and volume growth at fedex freight in addition we experienced severe winter weather in the prior year which positively affected the yearoveryear comparisons in 2022 

revenue at fedex express increased 9 in 2022 due to global package and international priority freight yield improvement partially offset by decreased international and us domestic package volume as well as lower us average daily freight pounds at fedex ground revenue increased 9 in 2022 primarily due to yield improvement two additional ground commercial operating days a mix shift to higheryielding services and growth in our commercial services fedex freight revenue increased 22 in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue per shipment and increased average daily shipments revenue at corporate other and eliminations increased 33 in 2022 primarily due to higher yields at fedex logistics inc “fedex logistics” as a result of market capacity constraints related to the covid19 pandemic 

fuel surcharges 

while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield see the “fuel” section of this mda for more information 

business realignment costs 

in 2021 fedex express announced a workforce reduction plan in europe related to the network integration of tnt express the plan will affect approximately 5000 employees in europe across operational teams and backoffice functions the execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations 

we incurred costs of 278 million 214 million net of tax or 080 per diluted share in 2022 and 116 million 90 million net of tax or 033 per diluted share in 2021 associated with our business realignment activities these costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements payments under this program totaled approximately 225 million in 2022 and approximately 15 million in 2021 we expect the pretax cost of our business realignment activities to be approximately 420 million through 2023 we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between 275 million and 350 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024 the actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates 

operating expenses 

the following table compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts in millions and as a percent of revenue for the years ended may 31 

  

1 includes tnt express integration expenses of 132 million in 2022 and 210 million in 2021 

2 includes costs associated with the workforce reduction plan in europe 

3 includes a 210 million charge in 2022 related to pre and postjudgment interest in connection with a fedex ground legal matter 

 50  

 

the challenging labor market and inflationary pressures contributed to increases in purchased transportation salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2022 higher fuel surcharges also contributed to increased purchased transportation costs salaries and employee benefits expense also increased in 2022 due to merit increases partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense higher selfinsurance accruals increased costs related to information technology expenses a charge related to pre and postjudgment interest in connection with a fedex ground legal matter and additional volumerelated expenses also contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2022 rentals and landing fees increased in 2022 primarily driven by increased vehicle and aircraft leases at fedex express as well as network expansion at fedex ground 

fuel 

we apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks we routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments the net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below does not include the impact from these ordinarycourse table changes 

while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered 

in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weightedaverage fuel surcharge percentages in effect for 2022 and 2021 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments 

fuel expense increased 77 during 2022 due to higher fuel prices in addition to variability in usage and market prices the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results for example our contracts for jet fuel purchases at fedex express are tied to various indices including the us gulf coast index while many of these indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangements approximately 70 of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day rather than based on daily spot rates these contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases 

because of the factors described above our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm for more information see “item 1a risk factors” 

the net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2022 as higher fuel surcharges outpaced increased fuel prices the net impact of fuel on our operating results does not consider the effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business including changes in demand and shifts in the mix of services purchased by our customers in addition our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel costs 

other income and expense 

interest expense decreased 104 million in 2022 primarily due to the 2021 debt extinguishment transactions further discussed in the “liquidity” section of this mda and note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements during 2021 we issued 325 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement and used the net proceeds to redeem outstanding debt in connection with our debt restructuring we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 393 million 297 million net of tax or 111 per diluted share in 2021 see note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information 

retirement plans mtm adjustments 

in 2022 we incurred a pretax noncash mtm loss of 16 billion 12 billion net of tax or 449 per diluted share which includes a net loss of 13 billion 10 billion net of tax or 376 per diluted share related to the yearend actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and liabilities these actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns demographic experience and an update to the mortality assumption partially offset by higher discount rates 

in addition we incurred a pretax noncash mtm net loss of 260 million 195 million net of tax or 073 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2022 of which 224 million was related to the termination of the tnt express netherlands pension plan effective october 1 2021 the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate multiemployer pension plan the remaining 36 million net loss was related to the us fedex freight pension plan and consisted of a 75 million mtm loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022 partially offset by a 39 million curtailment gain 

 51  

 

in 2021 we incurred a pretax noncash mtm gain of 12 billion 936 million net of tax or 348 per diluted share related to the yearend actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans’ assets and liabilities these actuarial adjustments were due to higher than expected asset returns and an improved discount rate 

additionally in 2021 we incurred a pretax noncash mtm net loss of 52 million 41 million net of tax or 015 per diluted share related to amendments to the tnt express netherlands pension plan benefits for approximately 2100 employees were frozen effective december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 these employees began earning pension benefits under a separate multiemployer pension plan this 52 million net loss consisted of a 106 million mtm loss due to a lower discount rate and a 54 million curtailment gain 

for more information see the “critical accounting estimates” section of this mda and note 1 and note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the 2022 tax provision was favorably impacted by a benefit of 142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates identified during the preparation of us and foreign tax returns the 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure 

the 2021 tax provision includes a benefit of 279 million from an increase in our 2020 tax loss that the cares act allowed to be carried back to 2015 when the us federal income tax rate was 35 the 2021 tax provision also includes a benefit of 66 million from a tax rate increase in the netherlands applied to our deferred tax asset balances and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in uncertain tax positions for matters in multiple jurisdictions 

we are subject to taxation in the us and various us state local and foreign jurisdictions we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service “irs” for the 2016 through 2019 tax years it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits however we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax including interest and penalties for any adjustments expected to occur 

during 2021 we filed suit in us district court for the western district of tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of us federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation we have recorded a cumulative benefit of 215 million through 2022 attributable to our interpretation of the tcja and the internal revenue code we continue to pursue this lawsuit however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded 

for more information on income taxes see the “critical accounting estimates” section of this mda and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 52  

 

russia and ukraine conflict 

the conflict in russia and ukraine that began in february 2022 continues as of the date of this annual report the safety of our team members in ukraine is our top priority we are providing team members in ukraine with financial assistance and other resources we have provided more than 23 million in humanitarian aid to support those impacted by the conflict in ukraine which includes 1 million of inkind shipping to organizations who are transporting supplies into the area as we focus on the safety of our team members we have suspended all services in ukraine russia and belarus which has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our business or results of operations for more information about the conflict between russia and ukraine and its effect on fedex’s business and results of operations see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report 

outlook 

during 2023 we anticipate revenue and operating income growth will be driven by improved yields and cost control actions as we continue to focus on yield management and revenue quality to help mitigate the impact of slowing economic conditions on our volumes and inflationary pressures on our costs we will continue to manage network capacity to demand levels flexing our network and making adjustments as needed to align operating costs to volumes we will also continue executing targeted actions to improve productivity and lower costs both through advanced technology and optimization of operations 

during 2023 we expect to continue our ongoing initiatives aimed to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe these actions are focused on reducing the complexity and fragmentation of our international business improving efficiency to meet changing customer expectations and business dynamics lowering costs increasing profitability and improving service levels as part of this strategy in 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in europe which we expect to be substantially complete in 2023 with aggregate spend through the completion of the program anticipated to be approximately 420 million in cash expenditures we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between 275 million and 350 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024 see the “business realignment costs” section of this mda for additional information 

our capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be consistent with 2022 at approximately 68 billion we expect increased investment in replacement vehicles including our vehicle electrification initiative information technology and strategic initiatives aimed to optimize operations across our networks to be offset with lower aircraft fleet modernization spend our expected capital expenditures for 2023 also include investments in facilities and equipment at fedex ground and the fedex express indianapolis and memphis hub expansion and modernization programs 

we will continue to evaluate our investments in critical longterm strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions for additional details on key 2023 capital projects refer to the “financial condition – capital resources” and “financial condition – liquidity outlook” sections of this mda 

the uncertainty of a slowing global economy geopolitical challenges including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and the continuing effect of the covid19 pandemic and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade supply chains fuel prices and our business in particular make any expectations for 2023 inherently less certain see “item 1a risk factors” for more information 

see “item 1a risk factors” and “forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance 

seasonality of business 

our businesses are cyclical in nature as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes revenue and earnings historically the us express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december international business particularly in the asiatous market peaks in october and november in advance of the us holiday sales season our first and third fiscal quarters because they are summer vacation and post winterholiday seasons have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest periods for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period shipment levels operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter see “item 1a risk factors” for more information

the results of corporate other and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments 

in 2022 the increase in operating results in corporate other and eliminations was primarily due to improved operating income at fedex logistics market capacity constraints related to the covid19 pandemic drove higher revenue due to increased yields partially offset by higher purchased transportation costs in addition 2022 operating results in corporate other and eliminations include a 210 million charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to pre and postjudgment interest in connection with a fedex ground legal matter see note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information

cash provided by operating activities cash flows from operating activities decreased 03 billion in 2022 primarily due to timing of variable incentive compensation payments and a decrease in other tax liabilities including prior year relief from certain taxes in the us pursuant to the cares act partially offset by lower accounts receivable due to the prior year effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as higher net income net of noncash items 

 61  

 

cash used in investing activities  capital expenditures were 15 higher in 2022 primarily due to increased spending on package handling equipment vehicles and trailers facilities and information technology partially offset by decreased aircraft spending see “capital resources” below for a more detailed discussion of capital expenditures during 2022 

financing activities  in january 2016 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares the “2016 repurchase program” in december 2021 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to 5 billion of fedex common stock the “2022 repurchase program” and together with the 2016 repurchase program the “repurchase programs” as part of the repurchase programs we entered into an asr agreement with a bank in december 2021 to repurchase an aggregate of 15 billion of our common stock during 2022 the asr transaction was completed and 61 million shares were delivered under the asr agreement we repurchased 28 million additional shares of our common stock during 2022

 liquidity outlook 

in response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the “outlook” section of this mda we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation in a challenging macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic labor availability and supply chain constraints inflationary pressures rising fuel prices and geopolitical conflicts we had 69 billion in cash at may 31 2022 and have 35 billion in available liquidity under our 20 billion fiveyear credit agreement the “fiveyear credit agreement and 15 billion threeyear credit agreement the “threeyear credit agreement” and together with the fiveyear credit agreement the “credit agreements” and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operations and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs which include operational requirements expected capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions dividend payments and stock repurchases 

we expect to repurchase 15 billion of our common stock in 2023 

our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31 2022 includes 29 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our us domestic debt or working capital obligations 

our 2023 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2022 at approximately 68 billion we expect increased investment in replacement vehicles including our vehicle electrification initiative information technology and strategic investments aimed to optimize operations across our networks to be offset with lower aircraft fleet modernization spend included within our expected 2023 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the fedex express indianapolis hub and fedex express memphis world hub which are expected to total 15 billion each over the life of each project our expected capital expenditures for 2023 also include 17 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at fedex express while we continue to invest in our business the capital intensity relative to revenue is expected to remain below historical levels 

we have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business beyond those committed for capital expenditures which consist of debt obligations lease obligations and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services refer to note 7 note 8 and note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information in addition we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements we do not have any guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

we have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of boeing 777 freighter and boeing 767300 freighter aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuelefficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant longterm operating savings and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraftrelated expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” that allows us to sell in one or more future offerings any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows passthrough trusts formed by fedex express to sell in one or more future offerings passthrough certificates

we made a voluntary contribution of 400 million to our tax qualified us domestic pension plans “us pension plans” in june 2023 and anticipate making 400 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2023 there are currently no anticipated required minimum contributions to our us pension plans based on our funded status and the fact we have a credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions over those required that exceeds 35 billion the credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements therefore we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal us pension plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year our us pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments 

on june 14 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 115 per share of common stock the dividend was paid on july 11 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 27 2022 each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis there are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends loans or advances

critical account ing estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements in many cases there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstances estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information 

the estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm 

retireme nt plans 

the rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management’s assumptions for expected returns on assets “eroa” discount rate and demographic experience such as salary increases expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs differences between these assumptions and actual experience are recognized in our earnings through mtm accounting the components of the mtm adjustments for the period ended may 31 are as follows presented as loss gain in millions 

 

  

 65  

 

our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate and eroa assumptions which are as follows 

 

 the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 50basispoint change in the eroa and discount rate assumptions for our largest pension plan and the resulting increase decrease in our projected benefit obligation “pbo” as of may 31 2022 and expense for the year ended may 31 2022 in millions 

 

 see note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our retirement plans 

incom e taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income taxes are a function of our income tax planning opportunities available to us statutory tax rates and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities as a result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transactions are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principles which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international business 

we evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available these evaluations are based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax laws or their interpretations audit activity and changes in our business in addition management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences 

tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws taxing authorities could challenge certain positions we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination and as a result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances we record the taxes for global intangible lowtaxed income as a period cost 

 66  

 

our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance 

for more information see the “income taxes” section of this mda and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

selfinsuran ce accruals 

our selfinsurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims including incurredbutnotreported claims components of our selfinsurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers’ compensation claims vehicle accidents property and cargo loss general business liabilities and benefits paid under employee disability programs these reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date these estimates include judgment about severity of claims frequency and volume of claims healthcare inflation seasonality and plan designs the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known which may be several years 

we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis nevertheless changes in accident frequency and severity healthcare costs insurance retention levels and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations selfinsurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended may 31 are as follows in millions 

 

 a fivepercent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our selfinsurance accruals would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 230 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended may 31 2022 

longlived assets 

useful lives and salvage values  our business is capital intensive with approximately 55 of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures 

the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset these evaluations consider usage maintenance costs and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment 

for our aircraft we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations as described below historically gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material however such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control 

impairment as of may 31 2022 the fedex express global air network included a fleet of 696 aircraft including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of us and international shipping services while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas us versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed 

 67  

 

because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs these activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand at may 31 2022 we had two purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service 

we evaluate our longlived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value we operate integrated transportation networks and accordingly cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decisions to remove certain longlived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types and those decisions may result in an impairment charge assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met the fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft such estimates are subject to revision from period to period 

in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels temporarily idled assets are classified as availableforuse and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets these temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis the criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service and as a result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations and changes to planned service expansion activities at may 31 2022 we had eight aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of 24 months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand 

leases  we utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft facilities and equipment such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in 2020 we had approximately 17 billion in operating lease liabilities and related rightofuse assets on the balance sheet as of may 31 2022 the weightedaverage remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at may 31 2022 was approximately 10 years 

our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the rightofuse asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement shortterm leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the righttouse asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets 

the lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee 

the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for buildtosuit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period we believe we have welldefined and controlled processes for making these evaluations including obtaining thirdparty appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations 

goodwill  we had 65 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31 2022 and 70 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31 2021 from our business acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business 

 68  

 

goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021 this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies principally the income or market approach classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and expected capital expenditures estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates 

as part of our qualitative assessment we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets 

the market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations growth size and risk profile relative to our reporting units changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units 

our reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight we evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2022 and 2021 therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates 

legal and other continge ncies 

we are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations contingent liabilities are difficult to measure as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability if any certain pending loss contingencies are described in note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in note 19 is not expected to be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters 

because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims including those relating to general commercial matters governmental enforcement actions employmentrelated claims and fedex ground’s service providers accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency such as a nonincome tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable ie the future event or events are likely to occur that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when in management’s judgment a material loss is reasonably possible or probable 

during the preparation of our financial statements we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred a loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 

our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel as well as external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters 

 69  

 

in determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factors 

• the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding eg the lengthy and complex nature of classaction matters 

• the procedural status of each matter 

• any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial ie motion to dismiss or for summary judgment 

• the amount of time remaining before a trial date 

• the status of discovery 

• the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceedings and 

• our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial 

in reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements however events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss 

despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitati ve disclosures about market risk 

interest rates while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on our longterm debt as disclosed in note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we had outstanding fixedrate longterm debt exclusive of finance leases with an estimated fair value of 188 billion at may 31 2022 and outstanding fixed and floatingrate longterm debt exclusive of finance leases with an estimated fair value of 231 billion at may 31 2021 market risk for longterm debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately 518 million as of may 31 2022 and approximately 507 million as of may 31 2021 the underlying fair values of our longterm debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 

we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these retirement plans as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase net pension expense see the “critical accounting estimates — retirement plans” section of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information 

foreign currency while we are a global provider of transportation ecommerce and business services the majority of our transactions during the periods presented in this annual report are denominated in us dollars the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar australian dollar japanese yen and mexican peso historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars such as aircraft and fuel expenses foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly positive impact on operating income in 2022 and a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2021 however favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services which is not quantifiable at may 31 2022 the result of a uniform 10 strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in expected operating income of approximately 50 million for 2023 this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transactions in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 

 70  

 

we maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity which impacts our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk these derivatives are not designated as hedges and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income which was immaterial for 2022 and 2021 

commodity while we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharges for additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges see the “results of operations and outlook — consolidated results — fuel” section of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition”

we remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work in the us this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small minority and womenowned businesses we are also proud of our longstanding history of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are working to make our society more equitable and just such as the national association for the advancement of colored people and the national civil rights museum in 2021 we announced the launch of the fedex ecommerce learning lab which is designed to help diverse small business owners looking to develop or expand their ecommerce operations with a focus on women and entrepreneurs of color

the environment 

at fedex we remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize the impacts our business has on the environment in march 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 to help reach this goal we are designating more than 20 billion of initial investment in vehicle electrification sustainable energy and carbon sequestration including a pledge of 100 million to yale university to help establish the yale center for natural carbon capture 

our “practical sustainability” philosophy and “reduce replace revolutionize” approach guide our environmental strategy across three key areas of our environmental footprint our aviation fleet our vehicle fleet and our facilities throughout fedex team members are encouraged to implement our sustainability strategy and achieve our goals we equip team members with a variety of internal programs to advance our progress in reducing fuel emissions energy use and waste in the workplace

to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions we are replacing many of our older airplanes with more fuelefficient models and we have implemented efficiencies in flight operations through our global fedex fuel sense program these two initiatives saved more than 255 million gallons of jet fuel and avoided more than 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2020 a global increase in volume exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic delayed the retirement of certain older aircraft and led us to fall short of our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30 from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2020 however in 2020 we achieved a 27 reduction in aircraft emissions intensity since 2005 through a combination of our aircraft fleet modernization and operational programs we have also established a goal of obtaining 30 of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by calendar 2030 

we strive to employ the most advanced vehicle technologies to efficiently and safely move packages across our networks fedex express has established a goal to increase vehicle fuel efficiency by 50 from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025 through 2020 our efforts collectively resulted in a 45 improvement in fedex express vehicle fuel efficiency from our 2005 baseline 

we have an impressive global alternative fuel fleet with nearly 4100 alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid electric liquified or compressed natural gas liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in 2021 fedex express agreed to purchase 500 electric vehicles from general motors’ brightdrop and we recently conducted several successful initiatives involving electric vehicles in our operations we plan to transition the entire fedex parcel pickupanddelivery fleet to zeroemission electric vehicles by calendar 2040 using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles for example by calendar 2025 we expect 50 of fedex express global pickupanddelivery vehicle purchases will be electric rising to 100 of all purchases by calendar 2030 subject to availability we are developing innovative charging infrastructures to support the continued rollout of our electric vehicle fleet and across our operating companies we continue to electrify our forklift airport ground service equipment and other nonroad vehicles 

our zeroemission fedex sameday bot and pilot drone delivery service which are discussed in more detail below under “fedex services segment — customerdriven technology” have potential to serve as environmentally friendly alternatives for lastmile residential package deliveries we also continue to leverage the efficiency of intermodal rail transport for longhaul shipping at fedex ground and fedex freight and promote the use of electric vehicles and alternative fuels by independent service providers in our shipping network additionally we are working with manufacturers to test and pilot zeroemission vehicle technology for longhaul trucks and strive to implement the optimal technology and drive operational efficiency across our longhaul fleet

the efficient operation of our more than 5000 air and ground hubs local stations freight service centers and retail locations is critical to achieving our business and sustainability goals where appropriate we adopt the leadership in energy and environmental design “leed” standard in the us and the building research establishment environmental assessment method “breeam” in europe to guide efficient facility design and construction of stateoftheart facilities fedex express has committed to seek leed or breeam certification on all new us and european fedex express buildings where appropriate fedex has 32 leedcertified facilities across all of our operating companies at the end of 2020 approximately 450 fedex facilities were certified to the iso 14001 environmental management system standard

the “fedex” trademark service mark and trade name are essential to our worldwide business fedex fedex express fedex ground fedex freight fedex office fedex services fedex logistics fedex trade networks transport  brokerage fedex cross border fedex supply chain fedex custom critical fedex dataworks shoprunner and tnt express among others are trademarks service marks and trade names of federal express corporation or the respective companies for which registrations or applications for registration are on file as applicable we have authorized through licensing arrangements the use of certain of our trademarks service marks and trade names by our contractors and global service participants to support our business in addition we license the use of certain of our trademarks service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness 

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report for discussion of regulations related to pilots including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations that could affect our business

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates routes and services in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

 20 

 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by us and foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements 

compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change for example the eu has established the emissions trading system “ets” to regulate ghg emissions in the eu and adopted a directive in 2008 requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operations efforts by the eu in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended its stay on the extraterritorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to and from the european economic area “eea” through the end of calendar 2023 contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” 

in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting corsia which is a global marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the icao’s goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades technology operations and sustainable aviation fuel in june 2018 the icao adopted standards pertaining to countrybycountry implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019 in furtherance of these efforts in march 2019 the faa issued notice of a corsia program permitting us carriers to submit emissions data on a voluntary basis data reported will be used to set the initial emissions baseline and beginning in calendar 2021 carriers subject to the requirements of corsia will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credits to offset emissions in excess of the initial baseline in response to the creation of the corsia program in december 2017 the eu adopted a proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ets flights operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021 the eu has indicated that it will assess corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets as applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expenses beginning in calendar 2021 the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors including the number of our flights subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of icaoeligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by fedex 

 21 

 

additionally in calendar 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in march 2017 icao adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020 but also to new deliveries of current inproduction aircraft types from calendar 2023 additionally a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted these standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons in december 2020 the epa adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emissions standards which are aligned with the 2017 icao emissions standards  in the past the us congress has also considered bills that would regulate ghg emissions and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future in 2021 the us reentered the paris climate accord an agreement among 19 7 countries to reduce ghg emissions the effect of the reentry on future us policy regarding ghg emissions and on other ghg regulation is uncertain additionally the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business 

we are also subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations 

export controls  in recent years the us government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to us export control regulations such regulations can restrict the types of items that fedex customers are permitted to ship to certain entities and in some instances may prohibit fedex from serving certain entities altogether violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties for example the export control reform act of 2018 the “ecra” and its implementing regulations the export administration regulations the “ears” hold carriers such as fedex strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations violations of the ecra can result in criminal penalties of up to 1 million and civil penalties of 305000 or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs however the heightened focus on export controls by the us government increases fedex’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs 

in june 2019 fedex filed suit in us district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the us department of commerce the “doc” from enforcing prohibitions contained in the ears against fedex fedex believes that the ears violate common carriers’ rights to due process under the fifth amendment of the us constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations in september 2020 the court granted the doc’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit in november 2020 we appealed this decision

customs  our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor  all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these and other potential labor law changes see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report

 22 

 

data protection  recently there has been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad for example the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders for more information regarding data protection regulation see “ item 1a risk factors” of this annual report 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business results of operations financial condition and the price of our common stock additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business results of operations financial condition and the price of our common stock

 

macroeconomic and market risks

 

we are directly affected by the state of the global economy and antitrade measures while macroeconomic risks apply to most companies we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity our primary business is to transport goods so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods — key macroeconomic measurements influenced by among other things inflation and deflation supply chain disruptions interest rates and currency exchange rates labor costs fuel and energy prices buying patterns debt levels credit availability and disposable income when individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods we transport fewer goods and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers we transport goods shorter distances certain retailers are making investments to house goods in closer proximity to customers in connection with the recent growth in ecommerce demand and we expect this trend to continue in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels moreover as we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade world trade policies international taxes governmenttogovernment relations and the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets for instance antitrade and protectionist measures adopted by the us or other countries in which we do business such as trade controls tariffs quotas embargoes sanctions or retaliation by another country against such measures could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer goods being transported globally 

the uncertainty regarding the status of the united kingdom’s exit from the eu “brexit” has negatively impacted the united kingdom’s and the eu’s economies this negative impact will likely continue until the united kingdom and eu complete a postbrexit trade deal which is still in the process of being implemented any additional impact of brexit will depend on application of the terms of the trade deal further discussion between the parties on implementation of the trade deal could trigger significant market and economic disruption and the demand for our services could be depressed following brexit the movement of goods between the united kingdom and the remaining member states of the eu has become subject to additional inspections and documentation checks which may create delays at ports of entry and departure and potentially impact our ability to effectively provide our services additionally depending on the application of the terms of the trade deal we may face new regulations regarding trade aviation tax security and employees among others in the united kingdom compliance with such regulations could be costly negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition the postbrexit trade deal could also adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the euro and the british pound

we expect continued uncertainty in the global economy during 2022 additionally we incurred higher costs due to labor market challenges in 2021 and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2022 for more information see “our failure to retain or attract employee talent or maintain our company culture as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations” below and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report

 

 23 

 

 

additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations the us government has made and maintained significant changes in us trade policy and has taken certain actions that have negatively impacted us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the us several governments including the eu china and india have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the us these actions contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years any further changes in us or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and further increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose antitrade measures political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

 

additionally the us government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain circumstances and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions furthermore given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign governments may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

our transportation businesses are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel costs to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results as of may 31 2021 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higheryielding express services to our loweryielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether in addition disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation networks weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries economic sanctions imposed against oilproducing countries or specific industry participants changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns cyberattacks and other unpredictable events may impact fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future 

operating risks

a significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or results of operations our ability to attract and retain customers to efficiently operate our businesses and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication security and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages to track items that move through our delivery systems to efficiently plan deliveries to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions including through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments cyber terrorists cyber criminals and malicious employees or other insiders of fedex or thirdparty service providers data breaches of companies and governments have increased in recent years as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we our customers and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems additionally risks such as code anomalies “acts of god” transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platforms data leakage cyberfraud and human error pose a direct threat to our products services systems and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

 

the technology infrastructure of acquired businesses as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition see “failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer” below for additional information on risks related to our recent acquisition of shoprunner and launch of fedex dataworks

 24 

 

we also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties including our customers and thirdparty service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services such third parties may host process or have access to information we maintain about our company customers employees and vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services like us these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches cyberattacks and other events or actions that could damage disrupt or close down their networks or systems we have security processes protocols and standards in place including contractual provisions requiring such security measures that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access as a result of their engagements with us nevertheless a cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third parties’ security measures allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customers employees and vendors or disrupt our operations these third parties may also experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations customers employees and suppliers including personal information 

 

a disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer systems and websites could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repairs or replacements resulting in significant costs and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operations customer service and results of operations additionally a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by fedex or a trusted third party we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs 

we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives informationtechnology risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans including investments to retire and replace endoflife systems the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent intense and sophisticated despite our efforts we are not fully insulated from data breaches technology disruptions data loss and cyberfraud which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations for instance in 2017 tnt express worldwide operations were significantly affected due to the infiltration of an informationtechnology virus known as notpetya in 2017 fedex was one of many companies attacked by the rapidly spreading ransomware described as wannacry that exploited vulnerability in a thirdparty software program and infected computers using that program encrypting files and holding them for ransom during 2018 we discovered an unsecured server hosted by one of our thirdparty cloud service providers which exposed some archived account information related to a service discontinued after our 2015 acquisition of bongo international llc the server has been secured and we have found no indication that any information has been misappropriated in connection with the incident additionally we have experienced continual attempts by cyber criminals some of which were successful to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network none of the wannacry ransomware attack unsecured server or fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to fedex 

while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise see “our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection” below for additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection

the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and financial condition is highly unpredictable the covid19 pandemic has had varying impacts on the demand for our services our business operations and the global economy and supply chains there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread in certain regions of the world and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business and government shutdowns and other restrictions this uncertainty is expected to continue to impact our business in 2022 

we have experienced unprecedented demand for our residential delivery services rivaling our peak holiday season traffic we have incurred increased costs associated with this demand and lower composite yields than our typical service mix in addition demand for our commercial service offerings increased throughout 2021 as covid19 restrictions moderated globally while air freight capacity remained constrained our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which has required us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during the pandemic if we are unable to remain agile and continue to flex our networks to align with shipping volumes customer needs disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies market demands and operating conditions or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies for the duration of a prolonged period of economic recovery our business operations could be negatively impacted which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations

 25 

 

we have also incurred increased operating expenses related to personal protective equipment and medicalsafety supplies as well as additional security and cleaning services in order to protect our team members and customers due to the size scope and geographically dispersed nature of our operations the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employees may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries 

additionally a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid19 pandemic our business operations may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects on our business if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure

the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as the global economy will be dictated by future developments that remain uncertain and cannot be predicted such as its duration and spread the success of efforts to contain it and treat its impact the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the impact of actions taken in response resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate the future rate of ecommerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity certain financial and operating metrics that we reported for 2021 may not be indicative of results for future periods once the impact of the covid19 pandemic subsides

 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition such risks include but are not limited to additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations our ability to implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs our ability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired businesses changes in the business and financial soundness of the usps our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 and the impact of litigation or claims from customers team members suppliers regulators or other third parties relating to the covid19 pandemic or our actions in response to the pandemic

 

for more information about the covid19 pandemic and its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—impact of the covid19 pandemic” of this annual report

we are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us we are selfinsured up to certain limits that vary by type of risk for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims vehicle accidents property and cargo loss general business liabilities and benefits paid under employee healthcare and disability programs our reserves are established for estimates of loss on all incurred claims including incurredbutnotreported claims our selfinsurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims frequency and volume of claims healthcare inflation seasonality and plan designs which may be subject to a high degree of variability however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive material increases in the magnitude of claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity insurance retention levels judgment and settlement amounts associated legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates as a result our insurance and claims costs could increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition during 2021 higher selfinsurance accruals at fedex ground negatively impacted our results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information 

as a supplement to our selfinsurance program we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we selfinsure periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance risk volatility and premium expense although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or socalled “nuclear” verdicts including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families given this recent trend it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits if any claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage we would bear the excess in addition to our other selfinsured amounts

given the current claims environment the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing and the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly accordingly our excess insurance and claims expenses may increase or we could increase our selfinsured retention as policies are renewed or replaced our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided

the transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses including those in the transportation industry these security requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations for example the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements additionally the i cao ’s standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine without government oversight which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on allcargo aircraft was modified effective july 1 2021 as a result we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant moreover a terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services 

strategic risks

failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer we are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our longterm business strategy such as investments in aircraft fleet modernization strategic investments to increase capacity and improve productivity and safety and the fedex express indianapolis and memphis hub modernization and expansion programs additionally we are executing initiatives to use data to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members as well as to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe see “item 1 business” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for additional information 

such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures we have also incurred and may continue to incur increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy we may not be able to derive the expected value from our strategic investments and other decisions for example in 2021 we announced proposals to resize our european workforce as fedex express nears the completion of the network integration of tnt express including through consultations with works council representatives from across the region the actual amount and timing of cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans may differ from our current expectations and estimates if we are not able to successfully implement this plan our future financial results may suffer

changes in our business strategy may also expose us to new and heightened risks for example shoprunner which we acquired in december 2020 collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers its partners consumers with whom it has a direct relationship and users of its applications additionally it uses thirdparty service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers these service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data including payment information andor other confidential information the foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach developing privacy legislation within the us may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data within and among fedex dataworks shoprunner and the other fedex operating companies

further in developing our business strategy we make certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers the future rate of ecommerce growth competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other conditions may be different from our assumptions as technology customer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences our future financial results will suffer for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “strategy”

our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes highquality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable assets in addition we have a strong reputation among customers and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business such as customer service mishaps accidents catastrophes or incidents involving aircraft vehicles or facilities operated by us low service or safety levels data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions noncompliance with laws the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law or our advertising campaigns sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social media outlets such as facebook youtube instagram twitter and tiktok adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

changes in the business or financial soundness of the usps could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation services for the usps’s first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps’s international delivery service the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the usps additionally the usps continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations the usps is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of fedex express and other transportation providers these or additional difficulties or changes in the usps’s business including its ability to access capital any structural changes to its operations network volume levels service offerings service commitments or pricing could negatively impact our revenue results of operations and financial condition further a decision by the usps to terminate early or not renew its contract with fedex express for domestic services which expires in september 2024 would negatively impact our profitability 

our businesses are capital intensive and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels we make significant investments in aircraft package handling facilities vehicles technology sort equipment and other assets to support our transportation and business networks we also make significant investments to rebrand integrate and grow the companies that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes overcapacity could lead to belowmarket asset dispositions or writedowns as well as negatively impact operating margins and undercapacity could negatively impact service levels 

we face intense competition the transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capitalintensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs in addition some highvolume package shippers are developing and implementing inhouse delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share for example amazoncom is investing significant capital to establish a network of hubs aircraft and vehicles 

we believe we compete effectively with these companies — for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services more effectively bundle their services or offer services at lower prices it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition moreover if highvolume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide it may reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations these impacts could be exacerbated if highvolume package shippers attempt to offer such capabilities to third parties news regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively impact the price of our common stock 

 28 

 

additionally advancements in technology such as advanced safety systems automated package sorting handling and delivery autonomous delivery vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicles and digitization of freight services may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments 

our inability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures or strategic alliances could materially adversely affect us our strategy for longterm growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions form joint ventures or strategic alliances and realize the expected benefits from these transactions we have acquired businesses in europe latin america africa the us asia and australia over the past several years including tnt express expected tnt express integration costs have increased significantly since the acquisition was completed in 2016 and parts of the integration have taken longer than initially expected in order to fully leverage the capabilities that tnt express adds to our portfolio we must complete the final phase of fedex express and tnt express international air network interoperability 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resources cultural and other risks additionally we may be required to make significant capital expenditures andor incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions which may be higher than initially expected for example existing and future customer data in the systems and business of fedex and shoprunner which we acquired in december 2020 may not be immediately interoperable or may not be interoperable without significant added expense 

while we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and longterm profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses including their goodwill or other intangible assets in 2020 we incurred goodwill impairment charges of 358 million related to fedex office and fedex supply chain eliminating all of the goodwill attributable to these reporting units for additional information see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—goodwill and other asset impairment charges” of this annual report

our autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risks as discussed further in “item 1 business” under “fedex services segment—customer driven technology—autonomous delivery technology” we are exploring the use of autonomous delivery technologies within our operations autonomous delivery is a new and evolving market which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance growth the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and other trends this aspect of our business strategy is subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies including the ability to continue to develop autonomous delivery software and hardware access to sufficient capital our ability to develop and maintain necessary partnerships risks related to the manufacture of autonomous devices and significant competition from other companies some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous delivery technologies than we do 

in addition we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous delivery devices on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulations to the extent accidents cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous delivery devices occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny further regulation and reputational damage any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and growth prospects

human resource management risks

our failure to retain or attract employee talent or maintain our company culture as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our highquality employees many of whom are longstanding fedex team members difficulties in motivating rewarding retaining and recruiting employee talent including successors to members of senior management or the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations reputation and the price of our common stock certain positions at fedex have historically experienced high turnover rates which can lead to increased recruiting training and retention costs additionally our company culture is important to providing highquality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operations and other factors if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive ability and our business may be harmed 

 29 

 

our business is labor intensive in nature and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the markets where we and contracted service providers operate inflation unemployment levels within these markets prevailing wage rates behavioral changes health and other insurance costs safety levels of our operations adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations including increased minimum wage requirements or government programs and our reputation within the labor market we incurred higher costs due to labor market challenges in 2021 and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2022 additionally we are incurring increased wage rates and costs for additional personnel in place to support our operations and meet regulatory requirements in response to the covid19 pandemic see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” of this annual report for more information our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can hinder our ability to execute our business strategy negatively impact service levels and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationships with our employees and avoid having labor organizations organize groups of our employees our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions other than the pilots at fedex express and drivers at one fedex freight inc facility our us employees have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in 2015 which already had a small number of employees who are members of unions additionally certain of fedex express’s nonus employees are unionized 

our collective bargaining agreement with the alpa which represents the pilots of fedex express is scheduled to become amendable in november 2021 bargaining for a successor agreement began in may 2021 while collective bargaining agreements under the rla which covers the pilots at fedex express do not expire we may be unable to maintain certain favorable terms included in the current collective bargaining agreement following negotiations with the alpa our inability to successfully reach new collective bargaining agreements with the alpa and other unions representing fedex employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws however that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” such legislation could expose our customers to the type of service disruptions that the rla was designed to prevent — local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of timesensitive highvalue goods throughout our global network such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets 

there is also the possibility that congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies such as fedex ground and fedex freight whose employees are governed by the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the national labor relations board have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra finally changes to federal or state laws governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground’s service providers as independent employers of drivers if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service providers labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlays 

fedex ground relies on service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickupanddelivery operations and the status of these service providers as direct employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged we are defending jointemployer cases where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated as an employer of the drivers employed by service providers engaged by fedex ground we incur certain costs including legal fees in defending the status of service providers engaged by fedex ground as direct employers of their drivers we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses however adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory developments could among other things entitle service providers’ drivers to certain wage payments from the service providers and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground

proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us  in 2010 the faa proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to allcargo air carriers when the faa issued final regulations in 2011 the “2011 regulations” allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new requirements instead allcargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation in 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of allcargo carriers from the 2011 regulations and litigation in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the faa’s decision however this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups and the us congress is currently considering legislation that if adopted would require allcargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability 

increasing costs the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits especially pension and healthcare benefits could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees these programs include defined benefit pension plans defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans the costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions such as discount rates investment returns on plan assets salary increases expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity additionally the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex involve numerous assumptions and can produce volatility in our results of operations financial condition and liquidity for example our fourth quarter marktomarket “mtm” retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pretax noncash 12 billion gain 936 million net of tax or 348 per diluted share in 2021 and a pretax noncash 794 million loss 583 million net of tax or 222 per diluted share in 2020 for additional information on our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—retirement plans mtm adjustments” and note 14 of the consolidated financial statements included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report 

environmental climate and weather risks

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emissions especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions could impose substantial costs on us especially at fedex express these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change including corsia and the us’s recent reentry into the paris climate accord see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” 

moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services especially our air express services finally given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems 

 

we may be unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 in march 2021 we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification development of sustainable customer solutions identification and investment in alternative fuels fuel conservation and aircraft modernization programs and investments in our facilities and natural carbon sequestration 

 

 31 

 

 

execution of these strategies and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of zeroemission electric vehicles alternative fuels fuelefficient aircraft global electrical charging infrastructure offsite renewable energy and other materials and components unforeseen production design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration andor other related processes compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to ghg emissions carbon costs or climaterelated goals laborrelated regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions the actions of competitors and competitive pressures and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid19 pandemic 

 

t here is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations failure to achieve our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships further given investors’ increased focus related to environmental social and governance matters such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of fedex common stock and limit our access to financing such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock

our inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely impact our business and results of operations while we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes volcanoes wildfires hurricanes tornadoes floods severe winter weather conflicts or unrest terrorist attacks or other disturbances actual or threatened additionally shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our fedex express memphis world hub or one of our informationtechnology centers could adversely impact our business and results of operations we also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions moreover resulting economic dislocations including supply chain and fuel disruptions could adversely impact demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

other legal regulatory and miscellaneous risks

government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal state and local and nonus government regulations laws policies and actions there can be no assurance that such regulations laws policies and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services subject us to escalating costs or require us to modify our business models and objectives harming our financial results in particular legislative regulatory or other actions that us and nonus governments have undertaken or are considering in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty the use of new technology taxes foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions trade controls tariffs quotas embargoes or sanctions in the us or other countries complex economic sanctions export controls additional security or workplace and transportation safety requirements labor and employment standards including with respect to our pilots and benefits government contracting environmental standards and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition capital requirements effective tax rate and performance for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” additionally the new us presidential administration has indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing laws regulations and enforcement priorities and strategies that could among other things lead to comprehensive tax reform broadly increase the us minimum wage to 15 per hour make it easier for unions to organize our us employees and alter the employment relationship between service providers engaged by fedex ground and the drivers employed by those service providers 

we could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions from time to time changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities and our effective tax rate us and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies including statutory tax rates global minimum taxes digital taxes and transactions between affiliated companies such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed significant judgments estimates and calculations to be made and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced 

 32 

 

standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition for example in 2019 the us treasury department issued final regulations covering the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act certain guidance included in these final regulations is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of a 233 million cumulative benefit through 2019 during 2021 we filed suit in us district court for the western district of tennessee challenging the validity of this tax regulation our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of us federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation we continue to pursue this lawsuit however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection laws regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation including in some instances class action litigation fines sanctions or other penalties which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business including significantly expanded compliance burdens costs and enforcement risks for example the gdpr which became effective in 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time see “failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer” above for additional information on data protection risks related to our recent acquisition of shoprunner and launch of fedex dataworks 

the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may impact our operations and increase our operating costs our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and foreign governments in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks further our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and relations 

we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures in order to comply highprofile accidents catastrophes or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements these requirements can be issued with little or no notice or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether further our business may be adversely impacted when government agencies cease to operate as expected including due to partial shutdowns sequestrations or similar events which may result in among other things disruption in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals for additional discussion see “item 1 business” of this annual report under the caption “regulation” 

we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties including

consolidated results 

the following table compares summary operating results dollars in millions except per share amounts for the years ended may 31

 



 

the following table shows changes in revenue and operating results by reportable segment for 2021 compared to 2020 in millions







overview 

volume growth reflecting increased ecommerce demand accelerated by the coronavirus “covid19” pandemic as well as yield improvement related to pricing initiatives drove strong revenue and operating income growth in 2021 increased operating expenses to support unprecedented levels of demand for our services in the covid19 pandemic environment including higher labor costs costs related to operating our air network to support higher demand in key international supply chains and higher costs associated with operating our sevendayperweek network at fedex ground were incurred in 2021 see the “impact of the covid19 pandemic” section below for further information regarding the pandemic’s impact on our business 

 43 

 

our consolidated operating income improved during 2021 due to international export and us domestic package volume growth at fedex express residential volume growth at fedex ground and pricing initiatives across all of our transportation segments h igher variable incentive compensation expense negatively impacted yearoveryear operating income comparisons in 2021 by approximately  13 b illion  as maximum attainment levels were achieved for team members in our primary annual incentive programs  

we incurred tnt express integration expenses totaling 210 million 162 million net of tax or 060 per diluted share in 2021 a decrease of 60 million from 2020 the integration expenses are predominantly incremental costs directly associated with the integration of tnt express including professional and legal fees salaries and wages advertising and travel expenses internal salaries and wages are included only to the extent the individuals are assigned fulltime to integration activities these costs were recognized at fedex express and fedex corporate the identification of these costs as integrationrelated expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures integration expenses do not include costs associated with our business realignment activities see the “business realignment costs” section of this mda for further information 

our 2021 results include business realignment costs of 116 million 90 million net of tax or 033 per diluted share associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe announced in january 2021 see the “business realignment costs” section of this mda for more information

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recognized 369 million 366 million net of tax or 140 per diluted share of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the fedex office and print services inc “fedex office” and fedex logistics inc “fedex logistics” operating segments our 2020 results also include 66 million 50 million net of tax or 019 per diluted share of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at fedex express see the “goodwill and other asset impairment charges” section of this mda for more information

consolidated net income includes a pretax noncash gain of 12 billion in 2021 895 million net of tax or 333 per diluted share and a net loss of 794 million in 2020 583 million net of tax or 222 per diluted share associated with our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments see the “retirement plans mtm adjustments” section of this mda and note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

consolidated net income in 2021 also includes a loss on debt extinguishment of 393 million 297 million net of tax or 111 per diluted share associated with our capital allocation strategy which includes reducing outstanding debt see the “other income and expense” section of this mda and note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

net income for 2021 includes a tax benefit of 279 million 104 per diluted share related to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” which allows tax losses to be offset against income from prior years that was taxed at higher rates and a tax benefit of 66 million 025 per diluted share from a tax rate increase in the netherlands applied to our deferred tax asset balances in 2020 we recognized a tax benefit of 133 million 051 per diluted share from the reduction of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of 71 million 027 per diluted share related to the cares act see the “income taxes” section of this mda and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

impact of the covid19 pandemic

the covid19 pandemic had a profound impact on our industry throughout 2021 resulting in unprecedented demand for our residential delivery services rivaling our peak holiday season traffic in addition demand for our commercial service offerings increased throughout the year as covid19 restrictions moderated globally

during 2021 we were able to flex our networks and make adjustments as needed to accommodate increased volumes under current operating conditions however we incurred elevated operating expenses to support demand for our services in the covid19 pandemic environment our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which required us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during the pandemic including increased wage rates and costs for additional personnel in place to support our operations and meet regulatory requirements the safety of our team members our customers and the communities in which we operate is our top priority and we took and continue to take measures to adhere to all regulations and guidelines from government authorities related to the containment of covid19 and to protect and promote health and safety in connection with this we incurred increased operating expenses related to personal protective equipment and medicalsafety supplies as well as additional security and cleaning services in order to protect our team members and customers during the covid19 pandemic of approximately 255 million in 2021 and approximately 125 million in 2020 as a response to these increased costs we implemented various pricing initiatives throughout 2021 to mitigate the negative impact of the change in our operating expense profile 

 44 

 

we also took certain actions during 2021 to improve our liquidity and strengthen our financial position given the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic during 2021 we issued 970 million of passthrough certificates and 325 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement we used the proceeds of the senior unsecured debt offerings during the fourth quarter of 2021 to redeem 58 billion of our existing debt which eliminated nearterm debt obligations taken on during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic see note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and “financial condition—liquidity” below for additional information 

at the height of the pandemic congress passed the cares act which provided financial relief to businesses to help them survive the economic impact while continuing to employ workers and keep the us economy moving during 2021 we recorded an income tax benefit of 279 million related to the cares act provision allowing tax losses to be offset against income from prior years and a pretax benefit of approximately 165 million from the excise tax holiday that expired on december 31 2020 see note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information

we expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic the success of efforts to contain it and treat its impact the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks the resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate the future rate of ecommerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity see “item 1a risk factors” of this annual report for more information

the following graphs for fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight show selected yield trends for the years ended may 31 





 47 

 

 

revenue 

revenue increased 21 in 2021 primarily due to volume growth in residential delivery services at fedex ground and us domestic package volume growth at fedex express both reflecting increased ecommerce demand accelerated by the covid19 pandemic international export package volume growth at fedex express as well as pricing initiatives across all of our transportation segments also contributed to the increase in revenue during 2021 

at fedex ground revenue increased 34 in 2021 primarily due to residential delivery volume growth revenue at fedex express increased 18 in 2021 due to international export and us domestic package volume growth international export volume increased in 2021 driven by strong demand for international priority shipments due to air freight capacity constraints fedex freight revenue increased 10 in 2021 primarily due to higher revenue per shipment and increased average daily shipments 

business realignment costs

in january 2021 fedex express announced a workforce reduction plan in europe as it nears the completion of the network integration of tnt express the plan will impact between 5500 and 6300 employees in europe across operational teams and backoffice functions the execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur over an 18month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations 

we incurred costs during 2021 of 116 million 90 million net of tax or 033 per diluted share associated with our business realignment activities these costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements approximately 15 million was paid under this program in 2021 we expect the pretax cost of our business realignment activities to range from 300 million to 575 million through fiscal 2023 we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between 275 million and 350 million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal 2024 the actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates 

goodwill and other asset impairment charges

in 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 358 million predominantly attributable to our fedex office reporting unit as a result the goodwill attributed to this reporting unit has been fully impaired the covid19 pandemic resulted in store closures and declining print revenue at fedex office during the fourth quarter of 2020 which negatively impacted its nearterm operating performance we also recorded 11 million of other asset impairment charges at the fedex logistics operating segment in 2020

in 2020 we made the decision to permanently retire from service 10 airbus a310300 aircraft and 12 related engines at fedex express to align with the needs of the us domestic network and modernize its aircraft fleet as a consequence of this decision we recognized noncash impairment charges of 66 million 50 million net of tax or 019 per diluted share in the fedex express segment in 2020 for additional information regarding these impairment charges see the “critical accounting estimates” section of this mda and note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

operating expenses 

the following table compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts in millions and as a percent of revenue for the years ended may 31 



 





3 includes goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the fedex office fedex express and fedex logistics operating segments

our 2021 operating income improved due to international export and us domestic package volume growth at fedex express and residential volume growth at fedex ground reflecting increased demand accelerated by the covid19 pandemic as well as yield improvement related to pricing initiatives across all of our transportation segments we incurred increased operating expenses to support unprecedented levels of demand for our services in the covid19 pandemic environment our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which has required us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during the pandemic including increased wage rates and costs for additional personnel in place to support our operations and meet regulatory requirements

volume growth in 2021 as discussed above contributed to a 21 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense a 24 increase in purchased transportation costs and a 14 increase in other operating expenses higher variable incentive compensation expense also contributed to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in 2021 purchased transportation costs were also higher in 2021 primarily due to increased residential service mix at fedex ground in addition other operating expenses increased in 2021 reflecting higher selfinsurance accruals at fedex ground

fuel 

the following graph for our transportation segments shows our average cost of vehicle and jet fuel per gallon for the years ended may 31 

 

 

fuel expense decreased 9 during 2021 due to lower fuel prices fuel prices represent only one component of the factors we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our results which is a comparison of the yearoveryear change in these two factors is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weightedaverage fuel surcharge percentages in effect for 2021 and 2020 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments 

most of our fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks

the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results for example our contracts for jet fuel purchases at fedex express are tied to various indices including the us gulf coast index while many of these indices are aligned each index may fluctuate at a different pace driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangements approximately 70 of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day rather than based on daily spot rates these contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases 

because of the factors described above our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the shortterm for more information see “item 1a risk factors”

we routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments the net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below does not include the impact from these ordinarycourse table changes 

the net impact of fuel had a modest benefit to operating income in 2021 as decreased fuel prices outpaced lower fuel surcharges 

the net impact of fuel on our operating results does not consider the effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business including changes in demand and shifts in the mix of services purchased by our customers in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel costs while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional components include the mix of services sold the base price and extra service charges we obtain for these services and the level of pricing discounts offered 

 50 

 

other income and expense 

interest expense increased 121 million in 2021 primarily due to our us and euro debt issuances during the year as part of our capital allocation strategy we issued 325 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement during 2021 and used the net proceeds to redeem outstanding debt in connection with our debt restructuring we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 393 million 297 million net of tax or 111 per diluted share see note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information

retirement plans mtm adjustments 

we incurred a pretax noncash mtm net gain of 12 billion in 2021 936 million net of tax or 348 per diluted share and a net loss of 794 million in 2020 583 million net of tax or 222 per diluted share from actuarial adjustments to pension and postretirement healthcare plans related to the yearend measurement of plan assets and liabilities the net gain in 2021 is attributable to higher than expected asset returns and an improved discount rate the net loss in 2020 is attributable to a significantly lower discount rate partially offset by higher than expected asset returns 

in addition we incurred a pretax noncash mtm net loss of 52 million 41 million net of tax or 015 per diluted share in 2021 related to amendments to the tnt express netherlands pension plan benefits for approximately 2100 employees were frozen effective december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 these employees began earning pension benefits under a separate multiemployer pension plan this 52 million net loss consists of a 106 million mtm loss due to a lower discount rate and a 54 million curtailment gain 

for more information see the “critical accounting estimates” section of this mda and note 1 and note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

a reconciliation of total income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax to income before income taxes for the years ended may 31 is as follows dollars in millions

 



on march 27 2020 the cares act was enacted to address the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic in the united states among other things the cares act allows a fiveyear carryback period for tax losses generated in 2019 through 2021 the 2021 tax provision includes a benefit of 279 million from an increase in our 2020 tax loss that the cares act allows to be carried back to 2015 when the us federal income tax rate was 35 the increase in our estimated 2020 tax loss is attributable to our application for change in accounting method discussed below voluntary contributions to our taxqualified us domestic pension plans “us pension plans” and other accelerated deductions claimed on the 2020 tax return filed in 2021 the 2021 tax provision also includes a benefit of 66 million from a tax rate increase in the netherlands applied to our deferred tax asset balances and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in uncertain tax positions for matters in multiple jurisdictions

 51 

 

we filed an application with the internal revenue service “ irs ” in 2020 requesting approval to change our accounting method for depreciation to allow retroactive appl ication of tax regulations issued during 2020 on certain assets placed in service during 2018 and 2019 during 2021 the irs issued guidance granting automatic approval to change the method of accounting for these assets resulting in an income tax benefit of 130 million   

the 2020 tax provision includes a benefit of 133 million from the reduction of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax loss carryforwards and a benefit of 71 million in connection with our estimated 2020 tax loss that the cares act allows to be carried back to 2015 a tax year when the us federal income tax rate was 35 the 2020 tax provision also includes a deferred income tax expense of 51 million for a change in deferred tax balances related to future foreign tax credits from our international structure as a result of changes in legal entity forecasts during the fourth quarter the 2020 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by decreased earnings in certain nonus jurisdictions 

we are subject to taxation in the us and various us state local and foreign jurisdictions we are currently under examination by the irs for the 2016 through 2019 tax years it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits however we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax including interest and penalties for any adjustments expected to occur 

during 2021 we filed suit in us district court for the western district of tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of us federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation we have recorded a cumulative benefit of 233 million through 2019 attributable to our interpretation of the tcja and the internal revenue code we continue to pursue this lawsuit however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded

outlook 

during 2022 we expect volume and yield growth across our transportation segments to drive improved revenue and operating income we anticipate our volume to continue to benefit from growing demand for our ecommerce services and international export package services we also expect to continue to incur higher costs required to meet anticipated demand including higher labor costs as a result of challenging labor markets however variable incentive compensation expenses are not expected to be an expense headwind in 2022 

the uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic is expected to continue to impact our business in 2022 as the extent and timing of the postpandemic economic recovery remains uncertain we expect continued demand growth for our ecommerce services and global capacity constraints to continue driving strong demand for international export shipments in 2022 we will continue to manage network capacity to the demand levels flexing our network and making adjustments as needed to align with volumes and operating conditions

we will continue optimizing our fedex ground sevendayperweek residential delivery network capacity to meet evolving customer needs in 2022 in addition we will continue to focus on lastmile delivery optimization by directing certain us daydefinite fedex express shipments into the fedex ground network to increase efficiency and lower our costtoserve we also are focused on improving revenue quality and lowering costs through investments in technology aimed at improving productivity and safety

we expect to complete the final phase of fedex express and tnt express international air network interoperability in early calendar 2022 allowing us to leverage the capabilities that tnt express adds to our portfolio which is expected to improve our european revenue and profitability

we expect to incur approximately 150 million of tnt express integration expenses in 2022 in the form of professional fees outside service contracts salaries and wages and other operating expenses we now expect the aggregate integration program expenses to be approximately 18 billion through the completion of the physical network integration of tnt express into fedex express in 2022 which is slightly higher than our previous estimates due to costs associated with further optimizing our international legal entity structures and improving backoffice automation to enhance longterm cost savings

 52 

 

during 2022 we will continue to execute initiatives in addition to the integration to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe these actions are focused on reducing the complexity and fragmentation of our international business improving efficiency to meet changing customer expectations and business dynamic s  lowering costs increasing profitability and improving service levels we expect to incur additional costs over multiple years including transformation costs and capital investments related to these actions as part of this strategy in january 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in europe we expect the pretax cost of the severance benefits to be provided under the plan to range from 300 million to 575 million in cash expenditures through fiscal 2023 we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between 275 million and 350 million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal 2024 see the “business realignment costs” section of this mda for additional information 

our capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately 72 billion an increase of 13 billion from 2021 due to investments in capacity to support increased volume levels facility modernization as well as replacement capital spend which was postponed in 2021 to improve liquidity and strengthen our financial position our 2022 expected capital expenditures include investments in aircraft fleet modernization strategic investments to increase capacity and improve productivity and safety and the fedex express indianapolis and memphis hub modernization and expansion programs 

our aircraft fleet modernization and hub modernization and expansion programs at fedex express are multiyear programs that will entail significant investments over the next several years see the “contractual cash obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements” section of this mda for details of our capital commitments for 2022 and beyond we will continue to evaluate our investments in critical longterm strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions for additional details on key 2022 capital projects refer to the “financial condition – capital resources” and “financial condition – liquidity outlook” sections of this mda

see “item 1a risk factors” and “forwardlooking statements” for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance 

seasonality of business 

our businesses are cyclical in nature as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes revenue and earnings historically the us express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december international business particularly in the asiatous market peaks in october and november in advance of the us holiday sales season our first and third fiscal quarters because they are summer vacation and post winterholiday seasons have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest periods however fedex ground experienced peaklevel volumes since the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period shipment levels operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter see “item 1a risk factors” for more information

reportable segments 

fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight represent our major service lines and along with fedex services constitute our reportable segments our reportable segments include the following businesses 

 



 

 53 

 

 

fedex services segment 

the fedex services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the fedex services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments we review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income inclusive of fedex services segment allocations for the fedex services segment performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments 

the operating expense line item “intercompany charges” on the accompanying consolidated financial statements of our transportation segments reflects the allocations from the fedex services segment to the respective operating segments the allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided we believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions our allocation methodologies are refined periodically as necessary to reflect changes in our businesses

corporate other and eliminations 

corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions as well as certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business including certain costs associated with developing our innovate digitally strategic pillar these costs are not allocated to the other business segments 

also included in corporate and other are the fedex office operating segment which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses and the fedex logistics operating segment which provides integrated supply chain management solutions specialty transportation customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding additionally corporate and other includes the financial results of shoprunner inc beginning december 23 2020 

in 2021 the decrease in revenue in “corporate other and eliminations” was due to a decline in nonshipping revenue at fedex office resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by higher revenue at fedex logistics the higher revenue at fedex logistics in 2021 is driven by increased volumes and yields also resulting from the covid19 pandemic partially offset by the transfer of fedex custom critical and fedex cross border into the fedex express segment 

certain fedex operating companies provide transportation and related services for other fedex companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources for example during 2021 fedex freight provided road and intermodal support for both fedex ground and fedex express and fedex ground provided delivery support for certain fedex express packages as part of our lastmile optimization efforts in addition fedex express is working with fedex logistics to secure air charters for us customers billings for such services are based on negotiated rates which we believe approximate fair value and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment these rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material

fedex express segment operating income 

fedex express segment operating income increased substantially in 2021 primarily due to international export and us domestic package volume growth fedex express segment operating results include a pretax benefit of approximately 165 million in 2021 from a reduction in aviation excise taxes provided by the cares act which expired on december 31 2020 these factors were partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation expense of approximately 800 million in 2021 which includes approximately 125 million in special bonuses paid in january 2021 to our frontline operational team members we experienced constrained commercial air capacity leading to high usage of our aircraft fleet and increased costs of operating our global network in 2021 as result of the covid19 pandemic results in 2020 were negatively impacted by 66 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines

fedex express segment results include approximately 176 million of tnt express integration expenses in 2021 a decrease of 46 million from 2020 

salaries and employee benefits expense increased 18 in 2021 primarily due to staffing to support volume growth and higher variable incentive compensation expense in addition higher labor expense and increased costs associated with network contingencies as a result of the covid19 pandemic contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in 2021 purchased transportation expense increased 19 in 2021 primarily due to the transfer of fedex custom critical and fedex cross border into the fedex express segment as well as higher utilization of thirdparty transportation providers other operating expense increased 16 in 2021 primarily due to bad debt expense and additional volumerelated expenses maintenance and repairs expense increased 19 in 2021 primarily due to additional flight hours as constrained commercial air capacity drove increased usage of owned assets 

fuel expense decreased 8 in 2021 due to lower fuel prices partially offset by higher aircraft and vehicle fuel usage the net impact of fuel had a slightly negative impact to operating income in 2021 as lower fuel surcharges outpaced decreased fuel prices see the “results of operations and outlook – consolidated results – fuel” section of this mda for a description and additional discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results

fedex express segment outlook

liquidity outlook 

in response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the “outlook” section of this mda we have and will continue to actively manage our cash flow and seek to protect capital in a still challenging macroeconomic environment from the ongoing pandemic following our 11 debt reduction in the fourth quarter of 2021 our liquidity position remains strong with 71 billion in cash and 35 billion in available liquidity under our credit agreements and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operations and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs including expected 2022 capital expenditures as business and economic conditions improve we will routinely evaluate our capital allocation strategy with a continued focus on strengthening our balance sheet

our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31 2021 includes 23 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our us domestic debt or working capital obligations

our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 72 billion in 2022 which will include strategic investments to increase capacity to support elevated volume levels aircraft modernization at fedex express and investments in productivity and safety in addition we are making investments over multiple years of approximately 15 billion to significantly expand the fedex express indianapolis hub and approximately 15 billion to modernize the fedex express memphis world hub we expect approximately 50 of capital expenditures in 2022 to be designated for growth initiatives our expected capital expenditures for 2022 include 17 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at fedex express while we continue to invest in our business the capital intensity relative to revenue remains below historical levels

we have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of boeing 777 freighter and boeing 767300 freighter “b767f” aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuelefficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant longterm operating savings and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraftrelated expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements 

on june 22 2021 fedex express exercised options to purchase an additional 20 b767f aircraft ten of which will be delivered in 2024 and ten of which will be delivered in 2025

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” that allows us to sell in one or more future offerings any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows passthrough trusts formed by fedex express to sell in one or more future offerings passthrough certificates

the fiveyear credit agreement expires in march 2026 and includes a 250 million letter of credit sublimit the 364day credit agreement expires in march 2022 see note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the credit agreements 

for 2022 we anticipate making voluntary contributions of 500 million to our us pension plans as noted in our discussion of critical accounting estimates we do not anticipate contributions to our us pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future based on our funded status and the fact we have a credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions over those required that exceeds 3 billion the credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements therefore we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal us pension plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year our us pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments 

on june 14 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 075 per share of common stock the dividend was paid on july 12 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 28 2021 each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis

standard  poor’s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of bbb a certificates rating of aa a commercial paper rating of a2 and a ratings outlook of “stable” moody’s investors service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of baa2 a certificates rating of aa3 a commercial paper rating of p2 and a ratings outlook of “stable” if our credit ratings drop our interest expense may increase if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market if our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade our access to financing may become limited

we have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments not reflected in the table above that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations including standby letters of credit and surety bonds these instruments are required under certain us selfinsurance programs and are also used in the normal course of operations the underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets where applicable therefore no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves 

the amounts reflected in the table above for longterm debt represent future scheduled principal payments on our longterm debt 

the amounts reflected in the table above for finance leases represent undiscounted future minimum lease payments under noncancelable finance leases with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at may 31 2021

we do not have any guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements including variable interest entities which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 

other business matters

on june 24 2019 fedex filed suit in us district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the us department of commerce the “doc” from enforcing prohibitions contained in the export administration regulations against fedex on september 11 2020 the court granted the doc’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit on november 5 2020 we appealed this decision

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements in many cases there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstances estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information 

the estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm 

retirement plans 

overview  we sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees these programs include defined benefit pension plans defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans and are described in note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements the rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity 

we are required to record annual yearend adjustments to our financial statements for the net funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans the funded status of our plans also impacts our liquidity however the cash funding rules operate under a completely different set of assumptions and standards than those used for financial reporting purposes as a result our actual cash funding requirements can differ materially from our reported funded status

over the past several years we have taken numerous actions to reduce pensionrelated risk and expense including the introduction of our portable pension account benefit freezing our traditional pension benefit employing a liabilitydriven investment strategy permitting certain former employees with a traditional pension benefit to make a onetime irrevocable election to receive their benefits in a lumpsum distribution and transferring approximately 6 billion of our us pension plan obligations to metropolitan life insurance company 

in 2020 we announced the closing of our usbased defined benefit pension plans to new nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2020 we will introduce an all401kplan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8 across all usbased operating companies in 2022 during calendar 2021 current eligible employees under the portable pension account ppa pension formula will be given a onetime option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing ppa formula and remain in the existing 401k plan with its company match of up to 35 or to cease receiving compensation credits under the ppa and move to the new 401k plan with the higher company match of up to 8 changes to the new 401k plan structure become effective beginning january 1 2022 while this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our longterm pension costs it will not have a material impact on current or nearterm financial results 

the “salaries and employee benefits” caption of our accompanying consolidated income statements includes retirement plan expense associated with service costs the “other retirement plans income expense” caption of our accompanying consolidated income statements includes our fourth quarter mtm adjustment expense associated with prior service and interest costs the expected return on assets “eroa” and settlements the retirement plans mtm adjustments for 2021 also include the mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment related to amendments to the tnt express netherlands pension plan a summary of our retirement plan costs affecting our financial results over the past two years is as follows in millions 

 



the components of the mtm adjustments are as follows presented as gain loss in millions 

 



service cost for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans was 978 million in 2021 and 906 million in 2020 and is expected to be approximately 939 million in 2022 

net of all fees and expenses the actual rate of return on our us pension plan assets was 1290 which was higher than our expected return of 675 positive portfolio returns derived from our returnseeking assets were partially offset by losses from our fixedincome assets due to rising longterm interest rates the weightedaverage discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased six basis points from 305 at may 31 2020 to 311 at may 31 2021 the demographic experience in 2021 reflects an update to our mortality and retirement rate assumptions and a currentyear actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions

2 020 

the weightedaverage discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plans decreased 64 basis points from 369 at may 31 2019 to 305 at may 31 2020 the demographic experience in 2020 reflects an update to our mortality assumption and a currentyear actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumptions the actual rate of return which is net of all fees and expenses on our us pension plan assets of 1500 was higher than our expected return of 675 as returnseeking assets primarily equities were positive despite equity market volatility additionally fixedincome assets performed as expected as interest rates declined 

discount rate  the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or “pbo” to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year’s ongoing pension expense prior to any yearend mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate for our us pension plans at each measurement date was as follows 

 



we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuaries who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of highgrade corporate bonds rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criteria to ensure bonds with a call feature have a low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payments in a given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at oneyear forward rates 

the measurement of our pbo and the related impact on our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate assumption for our largest pension plan a 50basispoint increase in the discount rate would have decreased our 2021 pbo by approximately 21 billion and a 50basispoint decrease in the discount rate would have increased our 2021 pbo by approximately 23 billion however our annual net pension expense is less sensitive to changes in the discount rate for example a onebasispoint increase in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have a 43 million effect on the fourth quarter mtm adjustment but only a net 01 million impact on net pension expense 

plan assets the expected average rate of return on plan assets is a longterm forwardlooking assumption it is required to be the expected future longterm rate of earnings on plan assets our us pension plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradable securities and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of thirdparty pension fund investment managers as part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility we follow a liabilitydriven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities 

establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise as appropriate management considers the following factors in determining this assumption 







for consolidated pension expense we assumed a 675 expected longterm rate of return on our us pension plan assets in 2021 and 2020 for 2022 we have decreased our eroa assumption to 650 due to the significant increase in 2021 administrative expenses payable from the pension trust due to higher pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” variablerate premiums “vrp” and based on our longterm outlook for the capital markets the higher 2021 pbgc vrp resulted in a 25basis point lower rate of return compared to 2020 the historical annual return on our us pension plan assets calculated on a compound geometric basis was 79 net of all fees and expenses for the 15year period ended may 31 2021 for our us pension plans a onebasispoint change in our eroa would impact our 2022 pension expense by 3 million 

 68 

 

funded status the following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of may 31 on a financial reporting basis in millions 

 



funding the funding requirements for our us pension plans are governed by the pension protection act of 2006 which has aggressive funding requirements in order to avoid benefit payment restrictions that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rules falls below 80 at the beginning of a plan year all of our us pension plans have funded status levels in excess of 80 and our plans are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” additionally current benefit payments do not materially impact our total plan assets benefit payments for our us pension plans for 2021 were approximately 929 million or 31 of plan assets 

over the past several years we have made voluntary contributions to our us pension plans in excess of the minimum required contributions for 2022 no pension contributions are required for our us pension plans as they are fully funded under erisa however we expect to make voluntary contributions of 500 million to these plans in 2022 

see note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our retirement plans 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income taxes are a function of our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the tax laws in the various jurisdictions are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities as a result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transactions are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principles which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international business 

we evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available these evaluations are based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax laws or their interpretations audit activity and changes in our business in addition management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences 

tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws taxing authorities could challenge certain positions we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination so there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances we record the taxes for global intangible lowtaxed income as a period cost

 69 

 

our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws  including the tcja and the cares act  as further guidance is issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance 

for more information including impacts from the tcja and the cares act see the “income taxes” section of this mda and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

selfinsurance accruals 

we are selfinsured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims vehicle accidents property and cargo loss general business liabilities and benefits paid under employee healthcare and disability programs our reserves are established for estimates of loss on all incurred claims including incurredbutnotreported claims selfinsurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet were 40 billion at may 31 2021 and 33 billion at may 31 2020 approximately 39 of these accruals were classified as current liabilities 

our selfinsurance accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date these estimates include consideration of factors such as severity of claims frequency and volume of claims healthcare inflation seasonality and plan designs cost trends on material accruals are updated each quarter we selfinsure up to certain limits that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense 

we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis nevertheless changes in healthcare costs accident frequency and severity insurance retention levels and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 

longlived assets 

useful lives and salvage values  our business is capital intensive with approximately 53 of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures 

the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these assets in cargo configuration which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations as described below historically gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material however such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control 

impairment as of may 31 2021 the fedex express global air network included a fleet of 684 aircraft including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of us and international shipping services while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas us versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed 

because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs these activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand at may 31 2021 we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service 

 70 

 

the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value we operate integrated transportation networks and accordingly cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decisions to remove certain longlived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types and those decisions may result in an impairment charge assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met the fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft such estimates are subject to revision from period to period 

in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels temporarily idled assets are classified as availableforuse and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets these temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis the criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service and as a result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations and changes to planned service expansion activities at may 31 2021 we had nine aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of 17 months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand 

during 2020 we made the decision to permanently retire from service 10 airbus a310300 aircraft and 12 related engines at fedex express to align with the needs of the us domestic network and modernize its aircraft fleet as a consequence of this decision we recognized noncash impairment charges of 66 million 50 million net of tax or 019 per diluted share in the fedex express segment in 2020 

leases  we utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft facilities and equipment such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted june 1 2019 we had approximately 16 billion in operating lease liabilities and approximately 15 billion related rightofuse assets on the balance sheet as of may 31 2021 the weightedaverage remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at may 31 2021 was approximately 10 years 

our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the rightofuse asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement shortterm leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the righttouse asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets 

the lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee

the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for buildtosuit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period we believe we have welldefined and controlled processes for making these evaluations including obtaining thirdparty appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations 

goodwill  we had 70 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31 2021 and 64 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31 2020 from our business acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business 

 71 

 

goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 202 1 and 20 20  this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies principally the income or market approach classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy incorporating market participant considerations and management’s assumptions on revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and expected capital expenditures estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates 

our reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight we evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2021 and 2020 therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates 

in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recorded impairment charges of 358 million predominantly attributable to our fedex office reporting unit the covid19 pandemic resulted in store closures and declining print revenue at fedex office during the fourth quarter of 2020 which negatively impacted its nearterm operating performance based on these factors our outlook for the fedex office business and retail industry changed in the fourth quarter of 2020

legal and other contingencies 

we are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations contingent liabilities are difficult to measure as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability if any certain pending loss contingencies are described in note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in note 19 is not expected to be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters 

because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims including those relating to general commercial matters governmental enforcement actions employmentrelated claims and fedex ground’s service providers accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency such as a nonincome tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable ie the future event or events are likely to occur that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when in management’s judgment a material loss is reasonably possible or probable 

during the preparation of our financial statements we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred a loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated

our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel as well as external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters

in determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factors 









 72 

 

 







in reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements however events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss 

despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rates while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on our longterm debt as disclosed in note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we had outstanding fixedrate longterm debt exclusive of finance leases with an estimated fair value of 231 billion at may 31 2021 and outstanding fixed and floatingrate longterm debt exclusive of finance leases with an estimated fair value of 228 billion at may 31 2020 market risk for longterm debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately 507 million as of may 31 2021 and approximately 303 million as of may 31 2020 the underlying fair values of our longterm debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 

we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these retirement plans as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized declines in the value of plan assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase net pension expense 

foreign currency while we are a global provider of transportation ecommerce and business services the majority of our transactions during the periods presented in this annual report are denominated in us dollars the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso japanese yen and brazilian real historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expenses as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars such as aircraft and fuel expenses foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly negative impact on operating income in 2021 and a slightly positive impact on operating income in 2020 however favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services which is not quantifiable at may 31 2021 the result of a uniform 10 strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in an increase in expected operating income of 121 million for 2022 this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transactions in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 

we maintain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuations related to probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the currency of the transacting entity which impacts our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk these derivatives are not designated as hedges and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income which was immaterial for 2021 and 2020 

commodity while we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharges for additional discussion of our indexed fuel surcharges see the “results of operations and outlook — consolidated results — fuel” section of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition”

covid19 p andemic 

 

during 2020 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus “covid19” was declared a pandemic by the world health organization we began to experience business impacts from the covid19 pandemic as early as january 2020 when transpacific traffic was affected by the shutdowns in china and curtailment of commercial air flights while commercial volumes were down due to business closures across the world fedex ground residential delivery volumes increased to seasonal peak levels during the fourth quarter of 2020 due to stayathome orders and other pandemic responsive measures additionally we experienced a surge in transpacific and charter flight demand at fedex express in the fourth quarter of 2020 as airfreight capacity was limited due to restrictions on commercial activities

due to the crucial role we play in moving supply chains and delivering critical relief fedex is considered an essential business and is continuing to operate under stateofemergency and stayathome orders issued in the us and globally fedex remains committed to assisting our customers as they work to manage their supply chains and inventories we are flexing our networks and making adjustments as needed to align with volumes and operating conditions such as

strategy 

fedex has developed a unique business strategy whereby our companies compete collectively operate independently and manage collaboratively which allows us to provide a broad portfolio of transportation ecommerce and business services to our customers our companies compete collectively by standing as one brand worldwide and speaking with one voice they operate independently by focusing on our independent networks to meet distinct customer needs and they manage collaboratively by working together to sustain loyal relationships with our workforce customers and investors 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow our business strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility uncertainty and evolution have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy including the continued growth of ecommerce to that end we continue to modernize our aircraft fleet with more fuel efficient and loweremission aircraft expand our operations at fedex ground where we continue to see growing package volumes realign our systems and develop innovative service offerings

we believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets enhances service quality and reliability from each business unit each fedex company focuses on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs while our companies operate independently we continually look for ways to leverage our unique strengths in key areas across the fedex enterprise for example in 2020 we began directing certain us daydefinite residential fedex express shipments into the fedex ground network in order to optimize the cost of lastmile residential deliveries we expect lastmile optimization will allow us to increase efficiency and lower our costtoserve as ecommerce growth continues fedex ground and fedex freight are also collaborating to handle the significant increases in ecommerce and large package volume caused by the covid19 pandemic

additionally by focusing on the following five key areas we believe we will continue to uniquely position fedex for longterm success

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us

see item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report for discussion of regulations related to pilots including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations that could affect our business

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates routes and services in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by us and foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements 

compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change for example the eu has established the emissions trading system “ets” to regulate ghg emissions in the eu and adopted a directive in 2008 requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operations efforts by the eu in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended its stay on the extraterritorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to and from the european economic area “eea” through the end of calendar 2023 contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia”

in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting corsia which is a global marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the icao’s goal of carbonneutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades technology operations and sustainable aviation fuel in june 2018 the icao adopted standards pertaining to countrybycountry implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019 in furtherance of these efforts in march 2019 the faa issued notice of a corsia program permitting us carriers to submit emissions data on a voluntary basis data reported will be used to set the initial emissions baseline and beginning in calendar 2021 carriers subject to the requirements of corsia will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credits to offset emissions in excess of the initial baseline in response to the creation of the corsia program in december 2017 the eu adopted a proposal which indefinitely excludes from the ets flights operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021 the eu has indicated that it will assess corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets as applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expenses beginning in calendar 2021 the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors including the number of our flights subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of icaoeligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by fedex 

additionally in calendar 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in march 2017 icao adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020 but also to new deliveries of current inproduction aircraft types from calendar 2023 additionally a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted these standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons the calendar 2016 epa finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the adoption of the new certification standard for new aircraft emissions in the past the us congress has also considered bills that would regulate ghg emissions and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future however in calendar 2017 the us withdrew from the paris climate accord an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions and that withdrawal’s effect on future us policy regarding ghg emissions and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business

we are also subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations 

export controls  in recent years the us government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to us export control regulations such regulations can restrict the types of items that fedex customers are permitted to ship to certain entities and in some instances may prohibit fedex from serving certain entities altogether violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties for example the export control reform act of 2018 the “ecra” and its implementing regulations the export administration regulations the “ears” hold carriers such as fedex strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations violations of the ecra can result in criminal penalties of up to 1 million and civil penalties of 305000 or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs however the heightened focus on export controls by the us government increases fedex’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs 

during the first quarter of 2020 fedex filed suit in us district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the us department of commerce from enforcing prohibitions contained in the ears against fedex fedex believes that the ears violate common carriers’ rights to due process under the fifth amendment of the us constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations additionally the china state post bureau is currently conducting an investigation into the operations of fedex express regarding its handling of certain packages while attempting to comply with the ears fedex express has and will continue to fully cooperate with the chinese authorities on the investigation for more information see item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report

customs  our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions

labor  all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report

data protection  recently there has been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad for example the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders for more information regarding data protection regulation see item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report

strategy 

fedex has developed a unique business strategy whereby our companies compete collectively operate independently and manage collaboratively which allows us to provide a broad portfolio of transportation ecommerce and business services to our customers our companies compete collectively by standing as one brand worldwide and speaking with one voice they operate independently by focusing on our independent networks to meet distinct customer needs and they manage collaboratively by working together to sustain loyal relationships with our workforce customers and investors 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow our business strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility uncertainty and evolution have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy including the continued growth of ecommerce to that end we continue to modernize our aircraft fleet with more fuel efficient and loweremission aircraft expand our operations at fedex ground where we continue to see growing package volumes realign our systems and develop new innovative service offerings

while our business strategy guides our operating companies to compete collectively and manage collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets enhances service quality and reliability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

our business strategy allows us to respond to our current and potential customers’ evolving needs that are shaped by the following four key trends that are driving global commerce 









these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we believe it would be extremely difficult costly and timeconsuming to replicate our global network which includes the world’s largest allcargo air fleet and connects more than 99 of the world’s gross domestic product we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability

during 2019 we introduced a number of innovative solutions  advanced important longterm business initiatives and made other important investments that benefit our customers  employees and communities  including 

























reputation and responsibility

the environment 

our “reduce replace revolutionize” approach to fedex aircraft vehicles facilities and materials guides our environmental efforts to drive efficient use of resources and cost savings in furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment in 2017 we announced a new goal to increase fedex express vehicle fuel efficiency 50 from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025 after achieving our previous goal of a 30 improvement five years early through 2018 our efforts collectively resulted in a 40 improvement in fedex express vehicle fuel efficiency from our 2005 baseline we also continue to work towards our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30 from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2020 a goal that we increased from 20 in 2012 in 2018 we achieved a 23 reduction in aircraft emissions intensity since 2005 through a combination of our aircraft fleet modernization and operational programs we have also established a goal of obtaining 30 of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by calendar 2030 

to reduce the cost of fuel use and associated greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions we have implemented efficiencies in flight operations through our global fedex fuel sense program and we are replacing many of our older airplanes with more fuelefficient models these two initiatives saved more than 204 million gallons of jet fuel and avoided nearly 20 million metric tons of co 2 e emissions in 2018 over 15 more emissions avoided than 2017 we have an impressive global alternative fuel fleet with more than 3800 alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid electric compressed or liquefied natural gas liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in 2018 we placed a reservation for 20 fully electric semi trucks which will be operated by fedex freight and fedex express expects to add 1000 chanje v8100 electric delivery vehicles to its fleet by the end of 2020 additionally we expect the zeroemission batterypowered fedex sameday bot which is discussed in more detail below under “fedex services segment —fedex services — customerdriven technology” to be an environmentally friendly alternative to delivering small payloads in large vehicles

across the enterprise we work to utilize the emission technology available in each market for our vehicles which enables us to reduce emissions and minimize the impact of the remaining legacy vehicles in the fleet innovative approaches such as vehicle platooning offer the potential to increase truck fuel efficiency while enhancing safety

twentythree of our facilities around the world now generate renewable energy which collectively avoided more than 12000 metric tons of co 2 e emissions in 2018 in addition 19 fedex express facilities in the us have received certification in leadership in energy and environmental design leed ®  the us green building council’s system for rating the environmental performance of buildings fedex express has made leed certification the standard for newly built us facilities in addition fedex express also has three leedcertified facilities outside the us while fedex ground has six leedcertified facilities and fedex office has one all of which are in the us over 560 fedex express facilities and three fedex logistics facilities are certified to the iso 14001 environmental management system standard in europe fedex express uses the building research establishment environmental assessment method breeam as the standard for all new buildings for offices its minimum building standard is breeam excellent and for warehouses its minimum standard is breeam good

we also continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services and minimize waste generation through efforts that include recycling and the use of copy paper with recycled content among other environmentally responsible available choices in 2018 over 99 of paper purchased for use by fedex office was forest stewardship council or other thirdpartycertified as sustainably sourced we also use fedexbranded cardboard packaging at fedex express and fedex ground which is 100 recyclable and made from over 50 recycled content the longstanding paper shredding and recycling service at fedex office allows customers to bring any documents including sensitive items such as tax returns to a fedex office location and have them securely and confidentially shredded then recycled during 2018 almost 99 million pounds of paper were shredded and recycled through the service

as our business grows to meet the accelerating demands of ecommerce and other shipping needs our waste management strategies help ensure we recycle more of our own waste and encourage customers to recycle our packaging in 2018 78 of the solid waste generated in our operations was sent to recyclers one example of our environmentallyresponsible activities is the sustainable purchasing leadership council a us nonprofit organization that supports and recognizes sustainable procurement of which we are a founding member we continue to support the council by participating in technical advisory groups and applying best practice guidance to our own supply chain sustainability initiatives for additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment see httpcsrfedexcom

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” for additional discussion of regulations related to pilots including the faa’s mandatory retirement age of 65 that could affect our business

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

 18 

 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates routes and services in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by us and foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions increasingly state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements 

compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change for example the eu has established the emissions trading system “ets” to regulate ghg emissions in the eu and adopted a directive in 2008 requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operations efforts by the eu in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended its stay on the extraterritorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to and from the european economic area “eea” through the end of calendar 2023 contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” 

 19 

 

in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting corsia which is a global marketbased measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the icao’s goal of carbonneutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in technology operations infrastructure and sustainable aviation fuels in june 2018 the icao adopted standards pertaining to countrybycountry implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019 in furtherance of these efforts in march 2019 the faa issued notice of a corsia program permitting us carriers to submit emissions data on a voluntary basis data reported during calendar 2019 and 2020 will be used to set the calendar 2020 emissions baseline and beginning in calendar 2021 carriers subject to the requirements of corsia will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credits to offset emissions in excess of the calendar 2020 baseline in response to the creation of the corsia program in december 2017 the eu adopted a proposal which indefinitely excludes from the ets flights operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021 the eu has indicated that it will assess corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets as applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expenses beginning in calendar 2021 the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors including the number of our flights subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of icaoeligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by fedex 

additionally in calendar 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in march 2017 icao adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020 but also to new deliveries of current inproduction aircraft types from calendar 2023 additionally a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted these standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons the calendar 2016 epa finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the adoption of the new certification standard for new aircraft emissions expected in calendar 2019 or 2020 in the past the us congress has also considered bills that would regulate ghg emissions and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future however in calendar 2017 the us withdrew from the paris climate accord an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions and that withdrawal’s effect on future us policy regarding ghg emissions and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business

we are also subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations 

export controls in recent years the us government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to us export control regulations such regulations can restrict the types of items that fedex is permitted to transport for or deliver to certain entities and in some instances may prohibit fedex from serving certain entities altogether violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties for example the export control reform act of 2018 the “ecra” and its implementing regulations the export administration regulations the “ears” hold carriers such as fedex strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations violations of the ecra can result in criminal penalties of up to 1 million and civil penalties of 300000 or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs however the heightened focus on export controls by the us government increases fedex’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs see “recent developments” below for information regarding a lawsuit recently filed by fedex against the us department of commerce relating to the enforcement of prohibitions contained in the ears 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

 20 

 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

data protection  recently there has been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad for example the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws and are considering data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders for more information regarding data protection regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

recent developments

 

on june 24 2019 fedex filed suit in us district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the us department of commerce from enforcing prohibitions contained in the ears against fedex fedex believes that the ears violate common carriers’ rights to due process under the fifth amendment of the us constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the ears without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations

strategy 

fedex has developed a unique business strategy whereby our companies compete collectively operate independently and manage collaboratively which allows us to provide a broad portfolio of transportation ecommerce and business services to our customers our companies compete collectively by standing as one brand worldwide and speaking with one voice they operate independently by focusing on our independent networks to meet distinct customer needs and they manage collaboratively by working together to sustain loyal relationships with our workforce customers and investors 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow our business strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy to that end we continue to modernize our aircraft fleet with more fuel efficient and loweremission aircraft and expand and rationalize network capacity at fedex ground where we continue to see growing package volumes

while our business strategy guides our operating companies to compete collectively and manage collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality and reliability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

 4 

 

our business strategy allows us to respond to our current and potential customers’ evolving needs that are shaped by the following four key trends that are driving global commerce 









these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we believe it would be extremely difficult costly and timeconsuming to replicate our global network which includes the world’s largest allcargo air fleet and connects more than 99 of the world’s gross domestic product we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability three areas of focus that will allow us to accelerate performance going forward are







in particular in may 2016 we acquired tnt express which is the largest acquisition in fedex history this acquisition rapidly accelerates our european and global growth substantially enhances our global footprint through tnt express’s lowercost road networks in europe the middle east and asia and expands our capabilities and solutions for our customers the benefits of the integration of the fedex express and tnt express businesses are extensive for instance we are implementing new technology and processes and optimizing the location of our facilities and stations to deliver unmatched service we will benefit from efficiencies improved stop densities and economies of scale facilitated by integrated pickupanddelivery operations additionally we will operate one integrated global express network allowing us to capitalize on technology and solutions to most efficiently route parcels and freight through our integrated hub linehaul and intercontinental air network we also will improve the efficiency of staff functions and processes with innovative informationtechnology solutions streamlined support functions and the realization of significant sourcing savings globally furthermore we will grow revenue by offering a bestinclass portfolio of services through a single sales team with a single online customerfacing tool and through revenue management activities focused on improved market share yield and profitability 

the integration of fedex express and tnt express is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2020 and significant progress towards that goal was made during 2018 the integration of the two businesses generally occurs at a country level and our leadership teams which were put in place in 2017 and are comprised of fedex express and former tnt express executives have identified and are using three different integration models 1 direct serve to direct serve 2 global service participant fedex express model or associate tnt express model to direct serve and 3 global service participant to associate or associate to global service participant using these models we have begun successfully integrating the two businesses on a countrybycountry basis we will continue to refine our integration plans in response to future developments and changing conditions for example the integration was accelerated in light of the june 2017 cyberattack at tnt express and we have made additional investments to move tnt express information technology operations and commercial infrastructure to fedex platforms for further information about the cyberattack see the section titled “results of operations and outlook—consolidated results—overview” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition”

operationally we have begun a phased conversion of the intercontinental flights operated by asl airlines belgium formerly tnt airways to fedex express operations in particular in april 2017 we began operating a flight linking tnt express’s european air hub in liege belgium to the fedex world hub in memphis tennessee giving tnt express customers direct access to the portfolio of fedex services offered in the us and canada we also have implemented operations information technology that is foundational to the integration including technology that allows us to handle fedex express packages in the tnt express network and tnt express packages in the fedex express network and technology that allows for the management of customer inquiries across both the fedex express and tnt express customer service platforms additionally in 2018 we advanced intraeuropean road and air integration and are planning for the soft launch of a single road network in september 2018

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency capacity and speed of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability innovative service offerings and the fit within the customer’s overall supply chain

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

 18 

 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

 19 

 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights that are wholly within the eu are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to purchase emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights also in 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs 

additionally in 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare this finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the epa’s adoption of a new certification standard for new aircraft emissions expected in 2019 or 2020 for additional information on such efforts to regulate ghg emissions and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies such as the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

data protection  recently there has been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad for example the eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws and are considering data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders for more information regarding data protection regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

 

fedex has developed a unique business strategy whereby our companies compete collectively operate independently and manage collaboratively which allows us to provide a broad portfolio of transportation ecommerce and business services to our customers our companies compete collectively by standing as one brand worldwide and speaking with one voice they operate independently by focusing on our independent networks to meet distinct customer needs and they manage collaboratively by working together to sustain loyal relationships with our workforce customers and investors 

 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow our business strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy to that end we continue to modernize our aircraft fleet with more fuel efficient and loweremission aircraft and expand and rationalize network capacity at fedex ground where we continue to see growing package volumes

 

while our business strategy guides our operating companies to compete collectively and manage collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality and reliability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

 

our business strategy allows us to respond to our current and potential customers’ evolving needs that are shaped by the following four key trends that are driving global commerce 

 



 



 

 4 

 



 



 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability three areas of focus that will allow us to accelerate performance going forward are

 



 



 



 

in particular in may 2016 we acquired tnt express which is the largest acquisition in fedex history this acquisition rapidly accelerates our european and global growth substantially enhances our global footprint through tnt express’s lowercost road networks in europe the middle east and asia and expands our capabilities and solutions for our customers the benefits of the integration of the fedex express and tnt express businesses are extensive for instance we are implementing new technology and processes and optimizing the location of our facilities and stations to deliver unmatched service we will benefit from efficiencies improved stop densities and economies of scale facilitated by integrated pickup and delivery operations additionally we will operate one integrated global express network allowing us to capitalize on technology and solutions to most efficiently route parcels and freight through our integrated hub linehaul and intercontinental air network we also will improve the efficiency of staff functions and processes with innovative information technology solutions streamlined support functions and the realization of significant sourcing savings globally furthermore we will grow revenue by offering a bestinclass portfolio of services through a single sales team with a single online customer facing tool and through revenue management activities focused on improved market share yield and profitability 

 

the integration of fedex express and tnt express is expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and significant progress towards that goal was made during 2017 the integration of the two businesses generally occurs at a country level and our leadership teams which were put in place in 2017 and are comprised of fedex express and former tnt express executives have identified and are using three different integration models 1 direct serve to direct serve 2 global service participant fedex express model or associate tnt express model to direct serve and 3 global service participant to associate or associate to global service participant using these models we have begun successfully integrating the two businesses on a countrybycountry basis we will continue to refine our integration plans however particularly in light of the recent cyberattack at tnt express for further information about the cyberattack see the section titled “tnt express cyberattack” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k

 

operationally we have begun a phased conversion of the intercontinental flights operated by asl airlines belgium formerly tnt airways to fedex express operations in particular in april 2017 we began operating a flight linking tnt express’s european air hub in liege belgium to the fedex world hub in memphis tennessee giving tnt express customers direct access to the portfolio of fedex services offered in the us and canada we also have implemented operation information technology that is foundational to the integration including technology that allows us to handle fedex express packages in the tnt express network and tnt express packages in the fedex express network and technology that allows for the management of customer inquiries across both the fedex express and tnt express customer service platforms 

 

while the tnt express and fedex express integration was a primary area of focus in 2017 we also introduced additional innovative solutions and made other important investments that benefit our customers including

regulation 

 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended the “federal aviation act” both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

 17 

 

  

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example in 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights also in october 2016 the international civil aviation organization “icao” passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” which is a global marketbased emissions offset program to encourage carbonneutral growth beyond 2020 corsia is scheduled to take effect by 2021 icao continues to develop details regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs additionally in july 2016 the epa issued a finding that aircraft engine ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare this finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the epa’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions for additional information on such efforts to regulate ghg emissions and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations 

 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by us customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our website fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipping pickup shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickupanddelivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped also we have integrated our us ltl and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings 

  

 4  

performance and cash flow we are also focused on increasing returns to our stockholders as evidenced by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy in 2014 we began replacing some of our retired aircraft with the more efficient loweremission boeing 767300 freighter “b767f” aircraft the b767f aircraft is approximately 30 more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20 lower than the md10 aircraft it is replacing in 2015 to continue rationalizing capacity and modernizing our aircraft fleet to more effectively serve customers we retired an additional 15 aircraft and 21 related engines and adjusted the retirement schedule of 23 aircraft and 57 engines 

at the same time we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful fedex ground segment where we continue to boost package volumes 

tnt express is the largest acquisition in fedex history the addition of tnt express expands our global portfolio particularly in europe and will lower our cost to serve european markets by increasing density in our pickupanddelivery operations and accelerate our global growth we will enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging tnt express’s lowcost road networks in different regions around the world we have begun the process of integrating the tnt express operations with the fedex express network although the integration will take several years to fully execute tnt express and fedex express have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

  

  

  

   

 5  

the growth of ecommerce over the last several years has been significant according to thirdparty reports total ecommerce activity now accounts for one in six discretionary dollars spent by consumers if this trend continues calendar year 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that online sales grew near or above 15 yearoveryear we believe that fedex is well positioned to provide innovative solutions to meet the growing demand of ecommerce fedex continues to invest in growth at fedex ground in order to take advantage of opportunities in the businesstoconsumer market in the us genco has a broad portfolio of returns services to meet the needs of ecommerce merchants and customers 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in boeing 777 freighter “b777f” and b767f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example during 2016 we 

 

  

  

  

  

 profit improvement initiatives 

during 2013 we saw challenging global economic conditions — particularly for fedex express — as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability in response to these trends in 2013 we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of 16 billion at fedex express our profit improvement programs included multiple initiatives primarily across fedex express and fedex services to reduce our overall cost structure and enhancing the quality of our revenue 

  

 6  

we exited 2016 having achieved our profit improvement goals with a run rate of 16 billion of additional operating profit from the then 2013 base business fedex express has improved operating income by approximately 170 from 2013 despite lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable exchange rates driving flat to declining revenue during the fouryear period fedex services has reduced its total expenses while investing in major information technology transformation projects in addition our incentive compensation programs have been gradually reinstated so that 2017 business plan objectives will represent more fully funded compensation targets while this program is completed assuming continued modest growth in the us and global economies our profitability and productivity are expected to continue to increase for years to come as we further leverage the benefits of these initiatives and fully integrate our recent business acquisitions

in furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment we initiated an effort to increase fedex express vehicle fuel efficiency 30 from a 2005 baseline by 2020 and in 2016 we announced that we had surpassed that goal  we also continue with our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30 by 2020 on an emissions per availabletonmile basis a goal that we increased from 20 in 2012 we have also established a goal of obtaining 30 of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030 these efforts help us continue to reduce our environmental footprint as evidenced in 2015 when we saved more than 100 million gallons of jet fuel at fedex express and avoided more than one million metric tons of carbon emissions — all while our shipment volumes were up

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

  

 22  

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient 

  

 23  

manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example in 2015 the epa issued a proposed finding on ghg emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution the final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the epa’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions additionally in 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our website fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipping pickup shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickupanddelivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped also we have integrated our ltl and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow we are also focused on increasing returns to our stockholders as evidenced by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs

change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy for example in response to sluggish economic growth in 2013 we retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and related engines in 2014 we began replacing some of our retired aircraft with the more efficient loweremission boeing 767300 freighter aircraft “b767f” the b767f is approximately 30 more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20 lower than the md10 aircraft it is replacing in 2015 to continue rationalizing capacity and modernizing our aircraft fleet to more effectively serve customers we retired an additional 15 aircraft and 21 related engines and adjusted the retirement schedule of 23 aircraft and 57 engines 

at the same time we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful fedex ground segment where we continue to boost package volumes 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

  

  

  

 these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in boeing 777300 freighter “b777f” and b767f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example during 2015 we

 profit improvement initiatives 

during 2013 we saw challenging global economic conditions — particularly for fedex express — as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability in response to these trends in 2013 we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of 16 billion our plans position fedex express to exit 2016 with a run rate of 16 billion of additional operating profit from the then 2013 base business our profit improvement programs include multiple initiatives primarily across fedex express and fedex services that are reducing our overall cost structure and enhancing the quality of our revenue

during 2014 we completed a voluntary program offering cash buyouts to eligible usbased employees in certain staff functions as a result of this program approximately 3600 employees left the company 

we are also streamlining support functions and eliminating redundant systems and processes at the same time in addition to modernizing our air fleet we are transforming our us domestic express network by closing and realigning regional and district facilities reorganizing pickupanddelivery operations while maintaining our outstanding service levels improving flight and crew scheduling refining aircraft maintenance processes and improving fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet 

internationally we are working to improve the quality of our international revenue as customers continue to make more economical choices in a lowgrowth global economy by moving the linehaul of certain slowermoving shipments to thirdparty transportation providers and better leveraging capacity within the fedex express international network through for example the reduction of flights to and from asia recent international acquisitions will also help drive increases in international domestic revenues lastly we are improving revenue quality by adding value for our customers with innovative and marketleading

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of fedex express employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a us domestic collective bargaining representative of fedex express employees other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees certain of fedex express’s nonus employees are unionized fedex express believes its employee relations are excellent

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

  

 21  

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency “epa” is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example in 2015 the epa issued a proposed finding on ghg emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution the final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the epa’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions additionally in 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

  

 22  

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the rla while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the nmb before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our website fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipping pickup shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped also we have integrated our ltl and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow we are also focused on increasing returns to our stockholders as evidenced by our share repurchase program and the recent increase in our quarterly dividend 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy for example in response to sluggish economic growth in 2013 we retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and related engines in 2014 we began replacing some of our retired aircraft with the more efficient loweremission boeing 767300 freighter aircraft “767f” the 767f is approximately 30 more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20 lower than the md10 aircraft it is replacing

at the same time we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful fedex ground segment where we continue to boost package volumes 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

  

  

  

 these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in b777f and b767f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example during 2014 we

 profit improvement initiatives

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

  

 18  

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa continues to require fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of us air carriers abroad the right of a us carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the us and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the us such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

  

 19  

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example during 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the us at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

  

 20  

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy for example in response to sluggish economic growth we recently retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and related engines in addition we have decreased capacity between asia and the united states 

  

at the same time we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful fedex ground segment strategic management of the fedex ground business resulted in higher yields and volumes boosted by ecommerce and market share gains from continued growth in our fedex home delivery service in 2013 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

  

  

  

 these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in b777f and b767f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example since the beginning of 2013 we 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 business realignment 

during 2013 we saw a more challenging business environment — particularly for fedex express as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability in response to these trends in addition to the continued profit improvements in the base businesses at fedex ground and fedex freight our profit improvement programs announced in 2013 are targeting annual profitability improvement of 16 billion at fedex express by the end of 2016 from the full year 2013 base business the plan identifies several things the company will do including reducing our costs modernizing our aircraft fleet as discussed above adjusting our transportation networks to meet changing customer needs and remaining dedicated to our people and culture which have made us what we are today in the face of tepid global economic growth shifting customer preferences and volatile fuel prices we continue to adapt our networks striking the right balance between volume and yield improvements 

more specifically multiple initiatives primarily across fedex express and fedex services are reducing our overall cost structure for example we completed a voluntary program offering cash buyouts to eligible usbased employees in certain staff functions and approximately 3600 employees either have left or will be leaving voluntarily by the end of 2014 we are also streamlining support functions and eliminating redundant systems and processes at the same time in addition to modernizing our air fleet we are transforming our us domestic express network by closing and realigning regional and district facilities reorganizing pickup and delivery operations while maintaining our outstanding service levels improving flight and crew scheduling refining aircraft maintenance processes and improving fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet internationally we are working to improve the quality of our international revenue as customers continue to make more economical choices in a lowgrowth global economy by moving the linehaul of certain slowermoving shipments to thirdparty transportation providers and better leveraging capacity within the fedex express international network through for example the reduction of flights to and from asia the international acquisitions discussed above will also help drive significant increases in international domestic revenues lastly we are improving revenue quality by adding value for our customers with innovative and marketleading solutions expanding our small and mediumsize customer base and adding services for vertical industries such as healthcare and aerospace our way forward is clear as we continue to make fedex an even leaner more efficient business

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency capacity and speed of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings

independent contractor model 

although fedex ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings such as state tax or other administrative challenges where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue a number of recent judicial decisions support the company’s classification and the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent for a description of these proceedings see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” and note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

fedex ground has made changes to its relationships with the small businesses it contracts with that among other things provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors for example fedex ground has implemented or is implementing its independent service provider “isp” model in a number of states the isp model requires pickupanddelivery contractors based in those states to among other things i assume responsibility for the pickupanddelivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes and ii negotiate independent agreements with fedex ground rather than agree to a standard contract to date fedex ground has transitioned to the isp model in 17 states depending on a number of considerations fedex ground may transition to it in other states as well

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in december 2012 the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule it is reasonably possible however that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

  

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa continues to require fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the united states such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

  

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example during 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights because the european union ets is being contested by many countries on a number of fronts and the effective date for parts of the ets has been delayed until next year the future impact on us is unclear for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the united states at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

  

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act we have comprehensive export controls and economic sanctions programs designed to ensure compliance with united states and other applicable export laws rules and regulations as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor the effectiveness of our international trade compliance programs we recently identified the shipments described below involving fedex express which occurred during 2013 

during 2013 a dubaibased package consolidator tendered approximately 32000 shipments to fedex express for handling including 16 separate shipments for delivery to branches of mir business bank in russia and branches of bank melli in azerbaijan iraq and germany both banks are identified on the list of specially designated nationals maintained by the united states treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” each of these shipments contained only documents the aggregate revenue for these shipments was 212 there was no profit associated with these shipments 

this consolidator also tendered six separate shipments to fedex express for delivery to iranian embassies and a consulate in germany malaysia australia thailand and argentina these shipments contained documents books magazines cds toys nuts andor candy the aggregate revenue for these shipments was 218 there was no profit associated with these shipments 

the tendering of these shipments to fedex express violated the terms of the written agreements between fedex express and this consolidator 

fedex express’s handling of these shipments was inadvertent and not in accordance with our internal policies and procedures promptly upon learning of these shipments fedex express canceled its agreements with the consolidator described above and certain other dubaibased package consolidators and discontinued certain services in dubai we have implemented enhanced controls procedures and other measures in connection with our international trade compliance programs that are designed to prevent these activities from recurring 

our investigation into past shipments tendered by dubaibased consolidators is ongoing we have made initial voluntary disclosures to ofac and will supplement these disclosures as our investigation is completed we intend to fully cooperate with ofac regarding these matters

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipping pickup shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped also we recently integrated our ltl and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively all our management incentive compensation programs across the enterprise are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate allowing us to leverage and manage change volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy for example in may 2012 

  

we made a decision to retire from service 24 aircraft and related engines the decision to retire these aircraft will better align the us domestic air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes fedex express is also shortening the depreciable lives of an additional 54 aircraft and related engines this will accelerate the retirement of these aircraft to align with the delivery schedule for replacement boeing 767300 freighter “b767f” and boeing 757200 aircraft 

in order to continue the modernization of our aircraft fleet we have agreed to purchase a total of 46 new b767f aircraft with the first three arriving in fiscal 2014 and continued deliveries through 2019 the b767fs were selected as the best choice to begin replacing our md10s some of which are more than 40 years old and our airbus a310300s with aircraft of similar capacity and without the relatively high fuel and maintenance costs as we continue to improve the efficiency and technology of our aircraft fleet during 2012 we delayed the delivery of 11 boeing 777 freighter “b777f” aircraft to better align air network capacity to demand we have also converted four b777f aircraft deliveries – two scheduled for delivery in fiscal 2016 and two scheduled for delivery in fiscal 2017 – to equivalent purchase value for the b767fs referenced above 

at the same time we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful fedex ground segment strategic management of the fedex ground business resulted in higher yields and volumes boosted by ecommerce fedex smartpost and residential delivery solutions in 2012 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

  

  

  

 these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in b777f and b767f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example since the beginning of 2012 we

 most of fedex express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency capacity and speed of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings 

competitors within the united states include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns air freight forwarders and the usps fedex express’s principal international competitors are dhl ups tnt other foreign postal authorities freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines many of fedex express’s international competitors are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express

the pilots of fedex express who constitute a small percentage of our total employees are represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement this agreement becomes amendable in march 2013 

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a us domestic collective bargaining representative other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees certain of fedex express’s nonus employees are unionized fedex express believes its employee relations are excellent

fedex ground has an indexed fuel surcharge which is subject to a monthly adjustment the surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the us department of energy for example the fuel surcharge for june 2012 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for april 2012 changes to the fedex ground fuel surcharge when calculated according to the rounded index average and fedex ground trigger points are applied effective from the first monday of the month these trigger points may change from time to time but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedexcom approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable

evolution of independent contractor model 

although fedex ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings such as state tax audits or other administrative challenges where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue a number of recent judicial decisions support the company’s classification and the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent for a description of these proceedings see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” and note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

fedex ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that among other things provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors for example fedex ground has implemented or is implementing its independent service provider “isp” model in a number of states the isp model requires pickupanddelivery contractors based in those states to among other things i assume responsibility for the pickupanddelivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes and ii negotiate independent agreements with fedex ground rather than agree to a standard contract to date fedex ground has transitioned to the isp model in 17 states based upon the success of this model fedex ground may transition to it in other states as well 

in addition because of statespecific legal and regulatory issues fedex ground only contracts with contractors that i are organized as corporations registered and in good standing under applicable state law and ii ensure that their personnel who provide services under an operating agreement with fedex ground are treated as their employees fedex ground also has an ongoing nationwide program to incentivize contractors who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes during may 2012 approximately 85 of fedex ground’s package volume was delivered by multiple route owneroperators or independent service providers

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulations in december 2011 allcargo carriers including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules in may 2012 however the faa indicated that it would reconsider the exclusion of cargo pilots from these new pilot fatigue requirements thus it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

  

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa continues to require fedex express to comply with a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirements these requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

  

our operations outside of the united states such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreignowned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example during 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the european union are now covered by the ets requirements and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things the shipment of dangerous goods contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the united states at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an 

  

employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies through our holding company we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of the enterprise not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively all our management incentive compensation programs across the enterprise are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example to accommodate recent and anticipated international growth at fedex express we are adding flights purchasing aircraft and improving services to and from asia europe and latin america based on the longterm growth prospects of these regions we have agreed subject to certain conditions to purchase a total of 45 boeing 777 freighter “b777f” aircraft a new highcapacity longrange airplane 12 of which have already been delivered we also hold options to purchase an additional 13 b777f aircraft the b777f enables us to fly between major world markets with lower operating costs more shipments and in less time than before allowing later cutoff times for customers in these markets to drop off their shipments in addition we continue to expand network capacity at our growing fedex ground segment 

  4 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

 

 

 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in b777f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example in 2011 we

approximately 11 of fedex express’s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk the remainder of fedex express’s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency capacity and speed of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings 

  10 

competitors within the united states include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns air freight forwarders and the us postal service fedex express’s principal international competitors are dhl ups tnt other foreign postal authorities freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines many of fedex express’s international competitors are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express 

employees 

david j bronczek is the president and chief executive officer of fedex express which is headquartered in memphis tennessee as of may 31 2011 fedex express employed approximately 95000 permanent fulltime and 48000 permanent parttime employees of which approximately 15 are employed in the memphis area fedex express’s international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 27 of all employees 

the pilots of fedex express who constitute a small percentage of our total employees are represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement during the fourth quarter of 2011 the pilots ratified a new labor contract that includes safety initiatives increases in hourly pay rates and travel per diem rates and provisions for opening a european crew base the new contract is scheduled to become amendable in march 2013 unless the union exercises its option to shorten the contract in which case the agreement would be amendable in march 2012 and a portion of the hourly pay increases would be canceled 

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a us domestic collective bargaining representative other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees certain of fedex express’s nonus employees are unionized fedex express believes its relationship with all of its employees is excellent

evolution of independent contractor model 

although fedex ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings such as state tax audits or other administrative challenges where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue a number of recent judicial decisions have supported the company’s classification of them and the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent for a description of these proceedings see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” and note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

fedex ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that among other things provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors for example fedex ground has implemented or is implementing its independent service provider “isp” model in a number of states the isp model requires pickupanddelivery contractors based in those states to among other things i assume responsibility for the pickupanddelivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes and ii negotiate independent agreements with fedex ground rather than agree to a standard contract 

as of may 31 2011 fedex ground has transitioned to the isp model in maryland new hampshire rhode island and vermont and plans to complete transition to the isp model in connecticut delaware illinois iowa maine massachusetts minnesota mississippi missouri montana north dakota south dakota and tennessee during 2012 based upon the success of this model fedex ground may possibly transition to it in other states as well

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

  17 

in september 2010 the faa proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for the pilots of fedex express and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft it is reasonably possible that these rules if enacted as currently drafted or other future flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security the tsa has issued to us a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains many new and enhanced security requirements these requirements are not static but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements and to respond to evolving threats until these requirements are adopted we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

  18 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations outside of the united states such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict and sometimes prohibit our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market as an example the chinese government has adopted postal regulations that exclude foreignowned companies such as fedex from competing in the mainland china domestic document delivery market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for example during 2009 the european commission approved the extension of the european union emissions trading scheme “ets” for ghg emissions to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the european union will be covered by the ets requirements beginning in 2012 and each year we will be required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

  19 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the united states at our other companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress has in the past considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees for example there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network in addition federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the rla or nlra for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies through our holding company we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example to accommodate recent and anticipated international growth at fedex express we are adding flights purchasing aircraft and improving services to and from asia europe and latin america based on the longterm growth prospects of these regions we have agreed subject to certain conditions to purchase a total of 38 boeing 777 freighter “b777f” 

  4 

aircraft a new highcapacity longrange airplane six of which have already been delivered we also hold an option to purchase an additional 15 b777f aircraft the b777f enables us to fly between major world markets with lower operating costs more freight and in less time than before allowing later cutoff times for customers in these markets to drop off their shipments in addition we continue to expand network capacity at our growing fedex ground segment 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace and despite the uncertainty of the current economic environment we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

 

 

 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are investing in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience such as investments in b777f aircraft we also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example in 2010 we

fedex express has an indexed fuel surcharge for us domestic and us outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally where legally and contractually possible the surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for jet fuel for example the fuel surcharge for june 2010 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel published for april 2010 changes to the fedex express fuel surcharge when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and fedex express trigger points are applied effective from the first monday of the month these trigger points may change from time to time but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedexcom approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable the weighted average us domestic and us outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was 2010 — 6 2009 — 17 and 2008 — 17 these percentages reflect certain fuel surcharge reductions that are associated with our annual base rate increases

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency and capacity of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings 

competitors within the united states include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns airfreight forwarders and the us postal service fedex express’s principal international competitors are dhl ups tnt other foreign postal authorities freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines many of fedex express’s international competitors are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security in july 2007 the tsa issued to us a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contained many new and enhanced security requirements these requirements are not static but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements and to respond to evolving threats until these requirements are adopted we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

  17 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for such charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight fedex national ltl and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations including those at fedex express are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations within foreign countries such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict and sometimes prohibit our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market as an example in 2009 the chinese government adopted postal regulation that excludes foreigninvested companies such as fedex from competing in the mainland china domestic document delivery market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

  18 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot airfreight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” while labor relations within the united states at most of our companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting national now global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress is considering adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize small units of our employees for example there is a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies through our holding company we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example although the current global recession has negatively impacted all of our companies our fedex express fedex freight and fedex services segments have been disproportionately affected meanwhile our fedex ground segment continues to grow accordingly although we have implemented costreduction initiatives across the enterprise during 2009 these initiatives have been focused particularly on our fedex express fedex freight and fedex services segments for instance we have reduced hours personnel and network capacity at those segments but we continue to increase network capacity at the fedex ground segment albeit at a slower rate 

  4 

the following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace in the recent past and despite the current global recession we believe they will continue to do so over the long term 

 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability to this end we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the fedex customer experience for instance notwithstanding the current global recession we continue to invest in longterm strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience in addition we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers for example in 2009 we 

 

in june 2009 we announced a multiyear agreement with officemax to offer us domestic fedex express and fedex ground shipping services at all us officemax retail locations over 900 locations beginning later in calendar 2009 these additional staffed dropoff locations are expected to complement our existing retail network including our fedex office and print centers and further expand customer access to our services

in sum our overall longterm goal is to

fedex is well recognized as a leader not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation but also in global citizenship fedex understands that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship we are committed to sustainably connecting the world and enhancing the longterm value of the company for our shareowners and for the communities and businesses that rely on our services in 2009 we published our first global citizenship report available at httpaboutfedexdesigncdtcom citizenshipreport  which frames how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and includes important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities 

our people 

along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public fedex is widely acknowledged as a great place to work in 2009 we were listed among fortune’s “100 best companies to work for in america” — a list that we have made in 11 of the past 12 years in june 2009 we were listed among black enterprise magazine’s “40 best companies for diversity” — a list that we have made for five straight years since its inception it is our people — our greatest asset — that give us our strong reputation in addition to superior physical and information networks fedex has an exemplary human network with more than 280000 team members who are “absolutely positively” focused on safety the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities through our internal purple promise and humanitarian award programs we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare

fedex is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean alternative and renewable energy sources first in our industry to introduce hybrid vans in our fleet we now operate more than 170 hybrid vehicles around the globe with more than three million miles in revenue service our hybrid electric vehicles decrease greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 25 percent and increase fuel economy by over 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles 

our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability in calendar 2005 we installed a solarelectric system atop the fedex express regional hub in oakland to date this solarelectric system has provided more than 3 million kilowatthours kwh of clean energy since then we have installed solarelectric systems at two of fedex freight’s facilities in california and we are constructing a stateoftheart solarelectric sortingandhandling facility in cologne germany which is scheduled to be completed in 2010 

we are also modernizing our aircraft fleet for example we are retiring and replacing older boeing 727s with more fuelefficient and quieter boeing 757s the use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increase our jet fuel efficiency also as noted below we have selected the fuelefficient boeing 777 freighter “b777f” aircraft to meet future international operational needs 

governance 

fedex has an independent board of directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance reflecting this commitment we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the new york stock exchange’s corporate governance listing standards we have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements for example within the past few years we have

approximately 11 of fedex express’s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk the remainder of fedex express’s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

competition 

as described in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency and capacity of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings 

competitors within the united states include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns airfreight forwarders and the us postal service dhl exited the us domestic package market during 2009 fedex express’s principal international competitors are dhl ups tnt other foreign postal authorities freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines many of fedex express’s international competitors are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express 

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards and maintenance as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis 

  19 

under the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 as amended the transportation security administration “tsa” an agency within the department of homeland security has responsibility for aviation security in july 2007 the tsa issued to us a full allcargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contained many new and enhanced security requirements these requirements are not static but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements and to respond to evolving threats until these requirements are adopted we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight fedex national ltl and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

international  fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner additionally global air cargo carriers such as fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments 

our operations within foreign countries such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict and sometimes prohibit our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market as an example in 2009 the chinese government adopted postal regulation that excludes foreigninvested companies such as fedex from competing in the china domestic document delivery market 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications 

  20 

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates 

concern over climate change including the impact of global warming has led to significant us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions for a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors” 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex office’s copy machines additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot airfreight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions 

labor while labor relations within the united states at most of our companies are governed by the national labor relations act of 1935 as amended the “nlra” all us employees at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of 1926 as amended the “rla” under the rla groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees the rla also requires mandatory governmentled mediation of contract disputes supervised by the national mediation board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms this part of the rla helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy under the nlra employees can unionize in small localized groups and governmentled mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process 

  21 

the rla was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations as transportation systems evolved the law expanded to cover airlines which are the dominant national transportation systems of today as an air express carrier with an integrated airground network fedex express and its employees have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in 1971 the purpose of the rla is to offer employees a process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting national now global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such as at fedex express cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network 

the us congress is considering adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize small units of our employees for example there is a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire airground network for a description of these potential labor law changes see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k “risk factors”

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our operating companies through our holding company we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions 

we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the fedex customer experience for instance notwithstanding shortterm macroeconomic conditions we continue to expand our transportation networks as described below to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience in addition we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers such as through our integration of recent acquisitions in the longhaul ltl freight and international domestic express transportation markets and our new and improved service offerings for example in 2008 we launched fedex international economy service in ten asiapacific markets where we already offered fedex international priority service and we significantly enhanced our fedex sameday service offerings with the addition of sameday services for freight shipments and a new intracity sameday service in select markets 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our recently redesigned web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information as well as fedex office services similarly by making one call to fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our longterm earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

  4 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example 

 

despite the current macroeconomic slowdown and record high fuel prices we believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace 

 

  5 

 

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information this access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the world’s economy helping businesses and nations flourish and empowering individuals with greater choices and opportunities through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability by 

 

in sum our overall longterm goal is to 

 

reputation and responsibility 

by competing collectively under the fedex brand our operating companies benefit from one of the world’s most recognized brands fedex is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool among the many reputation awards we received during 2008 

 

fedex is well recognized as a leader not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation but also in corporate social responsibility and sustainability fedex understands that a sustainable business is intrinsically tied to a sustainable society we are committed to sustainably connecting the world and enhancing the longterm value of the company for our shareowners and employees and for the communities and businesses that rely on our services we expect to publish our first corporate social responsibility csr report later this year the report will measure and document fedex’s response to many global and local issues and opportunities that are relevant to our mission values and core competencies

our community 

we are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work all around the world as an example we routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes such as in support of the china earthquake and myanmar burma relief efforts this calendar year we promote diversity by among other things making contributions to nonprofit organizations that promote access to education such as the hispanic scholarship fund the united negro college fund and the asian  pacific islander american scholarship fund

the environment 

we are committed to protecting the environment fedex evaluates the environmental impacts of fedex packaging and copy and print services and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with a high recycled content 

fedex is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean alternative and renewable energy sources first in our industry to introduce hybrid vans in our fleet we now operate more than 170 hybrid vehicles around the globe with more than two million miles in revenue service our hybrid electric vehicles decrease greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 percent and increase fuel economy by over 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles 

our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability in 2008 we installed solarelectric systems at two of fedex freight’s facilities in california in calendar 2005 we opened california’s then largest corporate solar electric rooftop system atop the fedex express regional hub in oakland to date this solar electric system has provided approximately 32 gigawatt hours of renewable energy 

we are also modernizing our aircraft fleet for example we are retiring and replacing older boeing 727s with more fuelefficient and quieter boeing 757s the use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increase our jet fuel efficiency also as noted below we have selected the fuelefficient boeing 777 freighter “b777f” aircraft to meet future international expansion needs

governance 

fedex has an independent board of directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance reflecting this commitment we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the new york stock exchange’s corporate governance listing standards we have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements for example we use a majorityvoting standard in uncontested director elections and have a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote and the board is prohibited from changing back to a pluralityvoting standard without the approval of our stockholders 

in addition we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 one of our highest priorities and we have leveraged this effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting our goal has been not only to comply with the law but also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across fedex today and in the future 

our board of directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices including our corporate governance guidelines and our code of business conduct  ethics at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance the guidelines and the code which applies to all of our directors officers and employees including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers are available in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site at httpwwwfedexcomusinvestorrelations  we will post in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site information regarding any amendment to or waiver from the provisions of the code to the extent such disclosure is required the information on our web site however does not form part of this report

our operations within foreign countries such as fedex express’s growing international domestic operations are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict and sometimes prohibit our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market as an example china is currently considering postal regulation that would substantially limit if not exclude foreigninvested companies such as fedex from competing in the china domestic document delivery market

strategy 

 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of fedex express and each of our other operating companies through our holding company and fedex corporate services inc “fedex services” we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio 

of companies we intend to continue leveraging and extending the fedex brand and providing our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions 

 

we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the fedex customer experience for instance we are expanding our transportation and retail networks as described below to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience in addition we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers such as through our recent acquisitions in the longhaul ltl freight and international domestic express transportation markets as described below and our new and improved service offerings — for example fedex kinko’s print online see “fedex kinko’s segment” below 

 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information and fedex kinko’s office and print services similarly by making one call to the new fedex expedited freight services our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the best service meeting their needs through this one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped 

 

we manage our business as a portfolio — in the longterm best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively most of our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of fedex as a whole 

 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

 

our “compete collectively operate independently manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example 

 

  

we believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace 

 

 4 

  

  

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods services and information this access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the world’s economy helping businesses and nations flourish and empowering individuals with greater choices and opportunities through our global transportation information technology and retail networks we help to make this access possible we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability by 

 

  

during 2007 we made several strategic acquisitions each of which is expected to provide important contributions to our longterm growth productivity and profitability 

 

  

  

 5 

  

in sum our overall longterm goal is to continue to 

 

  

reputation and responsibility 

 

by competing collectively under the fedex brand our operating companies benefit from one of the world’s most recognized brands fedex is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool among the many reputation awards we received during 2007 

 

  

fedex is well recognized as a leader not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation but also in social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public fedex is widely acknowledged as a great place to work it is our people — our greatest asset — that give us our strong reputation in addition to superior physical and information networks fedex has an exemplary human network with more than 280000 employees and contractors who are “absolutely positively” focused on safety the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities through our internal purple promise and humanitarian award programs we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare 

 

community 

 

we are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work all around the world as an example we routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes we support and promote diversity and ethnic outreach by among other things making contributions to various nonprofit organizations that serve the africanamerican and hispanic communities such as the hispanic scholarship fund the national council of la raza the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp inroads the trumpet awards and the little rock nine foundation in addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism we develop strategic relationships with certain charitable organizations that share our values including

environment 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment fedex evaluates the environmental impacts of fedex packaging and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention fedex kinko’s history also includes a longstanding dedication to protecting the environment such as through the use of copy paper with a high recycled content 

 

fedex is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean alternative and renewable energy sources for example the fedex express optifleet e700 hybrid electric vehicle decreases particulate emissions by over 90 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by over 25 percent and increases fuel economy by over 40 percent fedex express operates 93 hybrid vehicles in north america with more than 1 million miles in revenue service in august 2005 we opened california’s then largest corporate solar electric rooftop system atop the fedex express regional hub in oakland to date this solar electric system has provided approximately 2 billion watt hours of renewable energy generated by sunlight we are also modernizing our aircraft fleet for example we are retiring and replacing older boeing 727s with more fuelefficient and quieter boeing 757s the use of newer and more fuel efficient aircraft will have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency 

 

governance 

 

fedex has an independent board of directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance reflecting this commitment we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the new york stock exchange’s corporate governance listing standards we have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements for example in march 2007 our board of directors adopted a majorityvoting standard in uncontested director elections and a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote the board is prohibited from changing back to a pluralityvoting standard without the approval of our stockholders 

in addition we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 one of our highest priorities and we have leveraged this expensive and timeconsuming effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting our goal has been not only to comply with the law but also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across fedex today and in the future 

 

our board of directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices including our corporate governance guidelines and our code of business conduct  ethics at least annually in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance the guidelines and the code which applies to all of our directors officers and employees including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers are available in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site at httpwwwfedexcomusinvestorrelations  we will post in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site information regarding any amendment to or waiver from the provisions of the code to the extent such disclosure is required the information on our web site however does not form part of this report

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of fedex express and each of our other operating companies through our holding company and fedex corporate services inc “fedex services” we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue to leverage and extend the fedex brand and to provide our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions 

we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the fedex customer experience for instance in may 2006 we launched fedex expedited freight services a new onecall solution that enables customers to quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from fedex express fedex freight and fedex custom critical in order to select the best service meeting their needs through one point of contact customers can select from a broad range of freight services based on their pickup and delivery requirements time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped this new freight shipping solution further demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the customer experience through stateoftheart technology 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information and fedex kinko’s office and print services 

we manage our business as a portfolio—in the best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery information technology and retail networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively certain of our management incentive compensation programs are tied in part to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise each company’s operations cost structure policies and culture are designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “operate independently compete collectively manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example 

·   to accommodate international growth at fedex express we have added flights purchased aircraft increased capacity and improved services to and from europe and asia based on the growth prospects of these regions

·   we are expanding network capacity at our growing fedex ground and fedex freight companies for instance we expect to increase fedex ground’s daily package pickup capacity to approximately five million by 2011

·   we are expanding the fedex kinko’s retail network which will further increase customer access to fedex shipping services and offer growth opportunities in commercial document solutions and other business services

we believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace 

·   globalization   as the world’s economy becomes more fully integrated and as barriers and borders to trade continue to decrease companies are sourcing and selling globally the increase in global sourcing and selling has led companies to streamline their supply chains and open new markets with customers in more than 220 countries and territories we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach delivery services and information capabilities

·   supply chain acceleration   as the economy has become increasingly global it has also become more fastpaced businesses cannot wait weeks to source components and finished goods from around the world especially in hightech industries with high obsolescence rates as a result companies of all sizes depend on the delivery of justintime inventory to help them compete faster and more efficiently we have taken advantage of the move toward faster more efficient supply chains by helping customers substitute near realtime information to manage inventory in motion thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding timetomarket

·   increase in hightech and highvalueadded businesses   hightech and highvalueadded goods continue to increase as a percentage of total economic output these goods can be roughly defined as any product with a relatively high valuetoweight ratio or a high valueadded content—for example computers pharmaceuticals automotive goods electronics highfashion goods and aviation products our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of hightech and highvalueadded industries

·   growth of the internet and ecommerce   ecommerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses today it makes lowcost information available to anyone with internet access regardless of time or space it enables small and midsized companies to source and sell globally just like large corporations through our global transportation and technology networks we contribute to and benefit from the growth of the internet and ecommerce

these trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access—to goods services and information we continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward even stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability by 

·   optimizing and expanding our worldwide fedex express network particularly in key markets such as china and india

·   increasing the capacity speed and reliability of our fedex ground and fedex freight networks and expanding the fedex kinko’s retail network

·   emphasizing the “compete collectively” part of our core strategy through service improvements and focusing our employees and contractors on delivering the best customer experience in the industry resulting in better alignment across the entire fedex network

in 2006 we also agreed to make two strategic acquisitions each of which is expected to provide important contributions to our longterm growth productivity and profitability 

·   on january 24 2006 fedex express signed an agreement with tianjin datian w group co ltd “dtw group” to acquire dtw group’s fifty percent share of the fedexdtw international priority express joint venture and dtw group’s domestic express network in china for approximately 400 million in cash the acquisition will convert our joint venture with dtw group formed in 1999 into a wholly owned subsidiary and increase our presence in china in the international and domestic express 

businesses the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2007 and is subject to customary conditions including government approvals and licensing 

·   on may 26 2006 fedex signed an agreement to acquire the us and canadian ltl freight operations of watkins motor lines and certain affiliates for approximately 780 million in cash watkins motor lines a privately held company headquartered in lakeland florida is a leading provider of longhaul ltl freight services watkins’ us longhaul ltl freight business will be rebranded fedex national ltl and will operate as a separate network within the fedex freight segment watkins’ canadian business known as watkins canada express will be rebranded fedex freight canada and will extend fedex freight’s reach and create opportunities for growth in the canadian market the addition of watkins’ threeday or more longhaul service to fedex freight’s industryleading nextday and secondday regional ltl freight service will extend our leadership position in the heavyweight freight market the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2007 and is subject to customary conditions

reputation and responsibility 

by competing collectively under the fedex brand our operating companies benefit from one of the world’s most recognized brands fedex is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool among the many reputation awards we received during 2006

community 

we are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work all around the world as an example we routinely donate our transportation equipment and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes for example following hurricanes katrina and rita last 

year we worked directly with several relief organizations to facilitate the distribution of needed supplies we donated transportation for more than 1000 tons of relief supplies to the gulf coast region we also provided it and logistics support to emergency management personnel across the region 

in addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism we develop strategic relationships with charitable organizations that share our values including 

·   united way of america   we believe the united way is one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs fedex supports a yearly fundraising campaign companywide and fedex employee volunteers donate thousands of hours each year to support united way community efforts

environment 

we are committed to protecting the environment fedex evaluates the environmental impacts of fedex packaging products and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention fedex kinko’s history also includes a longstanding dedication to protecting the environment such as through the use of copy paper with a high recycled content and its global commitment sets standards for incorporating sustainable business practices that generate economic social and environmental value today and for future generations 

fedex is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean alternative and renewable energy sources for example the fedex express optifleet e700 hybrid electric vehicle decreases particulate emissions by over 90 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by over 25 percent and increases fuel economy by over 40 percent in august 2005 fedex express opened california’s then largest corporate solar electric system atop its regional hub in oakland to date this solar electric system has provided over 900000 kilowatt hours of renewable energy generated by sunlight fedex express is also modernizing its aircraft fleet retiring and replacing its older boeing 727s with more fuelefficient and quieter aircraft which will have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise 

governance 

fedex has an independent board of directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance reflecting this commitment we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the new york stock exchange’s corporate governance listing standards we have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements for example in april 2006 our board of directors announced its decision to submit to stockholders a proposal to amend fedex’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate all supermajority voting requirements fedex stockholders will vote on the board’s simple majority vote proposal at the september 25 2006 annual meeting 

in addition we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 one of our highest priorities and we have leveraged this expensive and timeconsuming effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting our goal has been not only to comply with the law but also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across fedex today and in the future 

we have a code of business conduct  ethics which applies to all of our directors officers and employees including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers our code of business conduct  ethics is available in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site at httpwwwfedexcomusinvestorrelations  we intend to post in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site information regarding any amendment to or waiver from the provisions of our code of business conduct  ethics to the extent such disclosure is required the information on our web site however does not form part of this report

us postal service agreements 

under two agreements with the us postal service that run through august 2008 fedex express provides air capacity for transportation of priority express and firstclass mail and has approximately 5000 drop boxes at us post offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas fedex express also provides transportation and delivery for the us postal service’s international delivery service called global express guaranteed gxg 

pricing 

fedex express periodically publishes list prices in its service guides for the majority of its services in general during 2006 us shipping rates were based on the service selected destination zone weight size any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a fedex express courier or dropped off by the customer at a fedex express fedex kinko’s or fedex authorized shipcenter location international rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size weight and destination fedex express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced 

fedex express has an indexed fuel surcharge for all us domestic and us outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally where legally and contractually possible the surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel for example the fuel surcharge for june 2006 was based on the spot price for jet fuel published for april 2006 changes to the fedex express fuel surcharge when calculated according to the spot price for jet fuel and fedex express trigger points are applied effective from the first monday of the month these trigger points may change from time to time but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedexcom approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable 

operations 

fedex express’s primary sorting facility located in memphis serves as the center of the company’s multiple hubandspoke system a second national hub is located in indianapolis in may 2006 we extended the term of our lease at the indianapolis international airport by twelve years and announced plans to significantly expand the indianapolis hub facility in addition to these national hubs fedex express operates regional hubs in newark oakland and fort worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in los angeles and chicago fedex express is building a new regional hub in greensboro north carolina which is scheduled to begin operations in 2009 

facilities in anchorage paris and subic bay philippines serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from asia europe and north america additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at narita airport in tokyo stansted airport outside london and pearson airport in toronto the facilities in subic bay and paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas a new facility in miami — the miami gateway hub — serves our south florida latin american and caribbean markets in january 2006 we broke ground on a new asia 

pacific hub at the guangzhou baiyun international airport in southern china the new asiapacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in subic bay philippines beginning in 2009 

throughout its worldwide network fedex express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area for more information about our sorting and handling facilities see part i item 2 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption “fedex express segment” in some international areas independent agents global service participants have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages 

fedex kinko’s offers retail access to fedex express shipping services at all of its us locations and is adding fedex express shipping services at its international locations fedex express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide instore dropoff sites our unmanned fedex drop boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings shopping centers corporate or industrial parks and outside us post offices 

fuel supplies and costs 

during 2006 fedex express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered the fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily because of our indexed fuel surcharge we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts see “fedex express — pricing” 

the following table sets forth fedex express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of total revenues for the last five fiscal years 

   

approximately 9 of fedex express’s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk the remainder of fedex express’s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

we believe that barring a substantial disruption in supplies our fuel purchase contracts will ensure the availability of an adequate supply of fuel for fedex express’s needs for the immediate future a substantial reduction of crude oil supplies or refining capacity or other events causing a substantial reduction in the supply of jet or vehicle fuel however could have a significant adverse effect on fedex express 

competition 

the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency and capacity of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings competitors in these markets include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” dhl passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns airfreight forwarders and the us postal service 

fedex express’s principal competitors in the international market are dhl ups foreign postal authorities such as deutsche post and tnt nv freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines many of fedex express’s competitors in the international market are governmentowned 

controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express 

employees 

david j bronczek is the president and chief executive officer of fedex express which is headquartered in memphis tennessee as of may 31 2006 fedex express employed approximately 87400 permanent fulltime and 51000 permanent parttime employees of which approximately 18 are employed in the memphis area fedex express’s international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 18 of all employees fedex express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent 

the pilots of fedex express are represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that became amendable on may 31 2004 in accordance with applicable labor law we will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots contract negotiations with alpa began in march 2004 these negotiations are ongoing and are being mediated through the national mediation board 

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a us domestic collective bargaining representative other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees

regulation 

air   under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the us department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards maintenance and corrosion control as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic and security aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from several points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner 

in 2001 the aviation and transportation security act transferred responsibility for aviation security from the faa to the transportation security administration “tsa” within the dot and ultimately the department of homeland security in may 2006 the tsa adopted new rules enhancing many of the security requirements for air cargo on both passenger and allcargo aircraft the tsa is currently seeking comments on a draft version of a new allcargo aircraft security program which would implement the new rules until the required security program is finalized we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results it is reasonably possible however that these rules or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers could impose material costs on us 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for charter flights 

ground   the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo air carriers and most 

motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

communication   because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications

environmental   pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations fedex express’s aircraft are also subject to and are in compliance with the regulations governing engine emissions in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex kinko’s copy machines and photo film developing operations additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs   our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot airfreight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions

strategy 

fedex was incorporated in delaware on october 2 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of fedex express and each of our other operating companies through our holding company and fedex corporate services inc “fedex services” we provide strategic direction to and coordination of the fedex portfolio of companies we intend to continue to leverage and extend one of our greatest assets the fedex brand and to provide our customers with convenient seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated business solutions we are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the fedex customer experience including improving the capabilities of our sales professionals for instance through our fedex onecall program we assign a single customer service agent to handle virtually all issues of a customer’s account 

we believe that sales and marketing activities as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our package delivery services are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies through the use of advanced information systems that connect the fedex companies we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of fedex services we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight shipment tracking customer service and invoicing information and fedex kinko’s office and print services 

we manage our business as a portfolio—in the best interest of fedex as a whole not a particular operating company as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery and information technology networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for our business as a whole for each fedex company we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow as an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively certain of our management incentive compensation programs are tied in part to the performance of fedex as a whole 

while we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively we continue to believe that operating independent networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each business unit each fedex company is free to focus exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise everything about each company—operations cost structure policies and culture—is designed to serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

our “operate independently compete collectively manage collaboratively” strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate for example 

·   to accommodate international growth at fedex express we have added flights purchased aircraft increased capacity and improved services to and from europe and asia based on the growth prospects of these regions

·   we are expanding network capacity at our growing fedex ground and fedex freight companies for instance we expect to increase fedex ground’s daily package pickup capacity to approximately five million by 2010

on the other hand we have streamlined resources within the us domestic fedex express network based on its slower growth rates we continue to implement focused strategies to improve our 

productivity and operational efficiency and to increase usage of fedex express’s us domestic services 

we believe the following four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace 

·   increase in hightech and highvalueadded businesses hightech and highvalueadded goods continue to increase as a percentage of total economic output these goods can be roughly defined as any product with a relatively high valuetoweight ratio or a high valueadded content—for example computers pharmaceuticals automotive goods electronics highfashion goods and aviation products our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of hightech and highvalueadded industries

·   globalization   as the world’s economy becomes more fully integrated and as barriers and borders to trade continue to decrease companies are sourcing and selling globally the increase in global sourcing and selling has led companies to streamline their supply chains and open new markets with customers in more than 220 countries and territories we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach delivery services and information capabilities according to the boeing company’s world air cargo forecast team air cargo traffic will expand at an average annual rate of 62 for the next two decades and express air cargo has grown at more than twice the rate of total worldwide air cargo traffic averaging more than 16 annually over the last decade according to air cargo world magazine fedex express has the largest share of the global air cargo market and thus received a number one ranking in the magazine’s “world’s top 50 cargo airlines” list during 2005

·   supply chain acceleration as the economy has become increasingly global it has also become more fastpaced businesses cannot wait weeks to source components and finished goods from around the world especially in hightech industries with high obsolescence rates as a result companies of all sizes depend on the delivery of justintime inventory to help them compete faster and more efficiently we have taken advantage of the move toward faster more efficient supply chains by helping customers substitute near realtime information to manage inventory in motion thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding timetomarket

·   growth of the internet and ecommerce according to forrester research us online retail sales are forecasted to more than double in the next six years—from 144 billion in calendar 2004 to 316 billion in calendar 2010 ecommerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses today it makes lowcost information available to anyone with internet access regardless of time or space it enables small and midsized companies to source and sell globally just like large corporations

we continue to position our companies to capitalize on these trends and move toward even stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability by 

·   optimizing and expanding our worldwide fedex express network particularly in key markets such as china india and eastern europe

·   aggressively growing the capacity of our fedex ground and fedex freight networks

·   restricting further growth in our cost structure especially at fedex express within the us

·   emphasizing the “compete collectively” part of our core strategy through service improvements and focusing our employees and contractors on delivering the best customer experience in the industry resulting in better alignment across the entire fedex network

·   integrating and expanding fedex kinko’s which will further increase our retail presence for fedex shipping services and offer growth opportunities in commercial document solutions and other business services

we acquired fedex kinko’s in february 2004 and have moved quickly to implement our retail vision we have completed the rebranding of kinko’s locations as fedex kinko’s office and print centers and converted 176 fedex world service centers into fullservice fedex kinko’s ship centers we also opened 48 new fedex kinko’s locations including 30 internationally during 2005 in addition fedex kinko’s has expanded its service offerings for example we have 

·   launched the full range of fedex express and fedex ground services at virtually all us locations and added packing supplies and boxes to the retail product assortment we are also adding fedex shipping services at fedex kinko’s international locations

·   launched packing services—creating a complete “packandship” solution—at virtually all us fedex kinko’s office and print centers

·   completed the rollout of tmobile hotspot wifi wireless broadband internet access at nearly all us locations and

·   launched file print fedex kinko’s an innovative software tool developed with microsoft that allows customers to access the full range of fedex kinko’s copying and printing services from their desktop

fedex kinko’s redefines the future of the business services marketplace by serving as a complete office on the road for business customers fedex kinko’s creates a onestop resource offering the industry’s broadest range of business services including document services retail products and services large format signs and graphics and other services fedex kinko’s retail network of approximately 1440 staffed locations also substantially increases customer access to fedex express and fedex ground services 

reputation and responsibility 

by competing collectively under the fedex banner our operating companies benefit from one of the world’s most recognized brands fedex is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the world and the fedex brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool among the many reputation awards we received during 2005 

·   fedex ranked in the top ten of fortune magazine’s “america’s most admired companies” and “world’s most admired companies” lists for the fourth consecutive year and ranked first in the magazine’s “delivery” industry list

·   for the second consecutive year fedex ranked in the top ten in “corporate reputation” in the wall street journal’s harris interactivereputation institute rq gold survey

·   fedex continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the university of michigan business school national quality research center’s american customer satisfaction index in the express delivery category

·   fedex ranked in the top 25 of informationweek magazine’s “informationweek 500” list of the most innovative users of information technology

fedex is well recognized as a leader not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation but also in social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public fedex is widely acknowledged as a great place to work in 2005 we were listed among fortune’s “100 best companies to work for in 

america” a list that we have made every year it has been published and computerworld magazine’s “100 best places to work in it” it is our people—our greatest asset—that give us our strong reputation in addition to superior physical and information networks fedex has an exemplary human network with more than 250000 employees and contractors who are “absolutely positively” focused on safety the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities through our internal purple promise and humanitarian award programs we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare 

community 

we are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work all around the world as an example we routinely donate our transportation equipment and services to deliver aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes for instance in response to the catastrophic earthquake and tsunamis that struck southeast asia in december 2004 we transported over 640 tons 128 million pounds of medicine relief supplies and water purification systems to that region in addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism we develop strategic relationships with charitable organizations that share our values including 

·   united way of america   we believe the united way is one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs fedex supports a yearly fundraising campaign companywide and fedex employee volunteers donate thousands of hours each year to support united way community efforts

·   american red cross   fedex works with the red cross to provide a quick response to disasters around the world fedex uses its logistics and transportation expertise to provide complimentary shipping of emergency supplies and assists with financial support in 2005 fedex worked with the red cross to transport essential disaster relief items to victims of hurricane ivan

·   national safe kids campaign   reflecting the fact that safety is one of our top priorities fedex is the sole corporate sponsor of safe kids “walk this way” a global program that advocates child pedestrian safety and teaches children parents and communities how to prevent pedestrian accidents

·   orbis international   fedex helps orbis international provide eye care and treatment to people in developing countries for example fedex provides free aircraft maintenance and volunteer pilots for orbis’s “flying eye hospital”—a converted dc10 aircraft equipped with surgical and training facilities

·   national civil rights museum   fedex serves as a major corporate sponsor of the national civil rights museum which educates the public on the lessons of the civil rights movement in the united states and its impact and influence on the human rights movement worldwide

·   march of dimes   fedex is a national sponsor of march of dimes’ walkamerica and thousands of fedex employees participate in it and other events that raise funds to help improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality

environment 

we are committed to protecting the environment fedex evaluates the environmental impacts of fedex packaging products and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include recycling and pollution prevention in 2005 we increased the postconsumer recycled content of the standard white paper used at fedex kinko’s office and print centers from 10 percent to 30 percent the new copy paper reflects fedex kinko’s longstanding dedication to protecting the environment and its global commitment which sets standards for incorporating sustainable business practices that generate economic social and environmental value today and for future generations 

fedex is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through efficient route planning and the use of clean alternative and renewable energy sources for example the fedex express optifleet e700 hybrid electric vehicle decreases particulate emissions by 96 percent and increases fuel efficiency by 50 percent in april 2005 we announced plans to add up to 75 of these hybrid electric vehicles to our already existing fleet of 18 in the next twelve months contingent on pricing and availability in 2005 fedex express constructed california’s largest corporate solar electric system atop its regional hub in oakland fedex express is also modernizing its aircraft fleet retiring and replacing its older boeing 727s with more fuelefficient and quieter planes which will have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise 

governance 

fedex has an independent board of directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance reflecting this commitment we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the new york stock exchange’s corporate governance listing standards we were proactive in early compliance with many aspects of those laws and have implemented many governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements for example during the past two years we 

·   added four highly qualified independent directors to the board august a busch iv the president of anheuserbusch inc john a edwardson the chairman and chief executive officer of cdw corporation j kenneth glass the chairman president and chief executive officer of first horizon national corporation and charles t manatt a partner and cofounder of manatt phelps  phillips llp

·   amended our bylaws with stockholder approval to eliminate the classified structure of the board and allow for the annual election of all directors as a result beginning with the september 26 2005 annual meeting all board members will stand for election annually

·   adopted a policy requiring stockholder approval for any future “poison pill” prior to or within twelve months after adoption of the poison pill a poison pill is a device used to deter a hostile takeover note that fedex does not currently have nor have we ever had a poison pill

·   established a stock ownership goal for senior officers including a recommendation that each officer and each board member retain stock acquired upon stock option exercises until his or her goal is met the board of directors has long had a stock ownership goal for nonmanagement directors

in addition we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 one of our highest priorities and we have leveraged this expensive and timeconsuming effort to further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting our goal was not only to comply with the law but 

also to build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across fedex today and in the future 

we have a code of business conduct  ethics which applies to all of our directors officers and employees including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers our code of business conduct  ethics is available in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site at httpwwwfedexcomusinvestorrelations  in addition we intend to post in the corporate governance section of the investor relations page of our web site information regarding any amendment to or waiver from the provisions of our code of business conduct  ethics to the extent such disclosure is required the information on our web site however does not form part of this report

international expansion 

fedex express is focused on further expanding its international presence especially in key markets such as china for example we recently announced plans to build a new asiapacific hub at 

the guangzhou baiyun international airport in southern china to better serve our global customers doing business in and with the fastgrowing china and asiapacific markets the new asiapacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing hub in subic bay philippines beginning in 2009 we began serving china in 1984 and since that time have expanded our service to cover more than 200 cities across the country with plans to add 100 additional cities over the next few years we launched the industry’s first direct flight from southern china to north america and in 2005 we established a new regional headquarters in shanghai the new regional structure there provides broader expertise and expanded resources and service offerings to mainland customers as part of our longterm commitment to china 

fedex express has more allcargo flights to and from china than any other us airline in june 2004 the united states and the people’s republic of china signed a new aviation accord that will further facilitate trade to and from china the agreement which extends through 2010 provides for 111 new weekly uschina flights for us cargo airlines such as fedex express the us department of transportation “dot” is responsible for allocating the new flights in october 2004 the dot awarded fedex express 12 additional weekly flights to china giving us a total of 23 weekly flights to china also fedex express has received tentative dot approval for three more weekly flights to china effective march 2006 which will bring our total to 26 

in 2005 we launched a daily direct flight from shanghai to frankfurt germany—the express air cargo industry’s first direct flight from mainland china to europe—further expanding our airlift capacity from china the new chinaeurope flight forms an important link in the fedex global network connecting the united states asia and europe it is part of a new westbound aroundtheworld lane that originates and terminates in memphis tennessee and provides connections via the fedex asiaone network to and from more than 130 cities in northern and eastern china additionally the flight links key manufacturing regions in germany into the fedex network while other parts of europe connect with the fedex euroone network via our paris hub we also introduced five weekly direct flights from cologne germany to memphis during 2005 the flights will provide nextbusiness day service improvements for shippers in the industrial heartland of germany as well as key markets in belgium and the netherlands the flight increases westbound transatlantic capacity by 20 percent and shippers in western germany will benefit from later pickup times fedex express already provides direct flights from stansted england paris france and frankfurt germany to our us hub locations 

through an alliance with la poste one of the world’s leading postal organizations customers of chronopost international a subsidiary of la poste have access to the fedex express air network additionally fedex customers in france and belgium have benefited from the enhanced ground infrastructure of la poste 

in anticipation of our future needs we have agreed to purchase ten airbus a380 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2009 fedex express will be the first company to take delivery of the airbus a380 freighter and the first to deploy the plane into service the immense capacity extensive range and excellent efficiency of this aircraft make it ideally suited for the anticipated needs of the fedex express global network later this decade to facilitate the use of our growing international network we offer strong international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements 

us postal service agreements 

under two agreements with the us postal service that run through august 2008 fedex express provides air capacity for transportation of priority express and firstclass mail and has placed approximately 5000 drop boxes at us post offices in approximately 325 metropolitan areas in november 2004 the air transportation agreement was amended to allow us to continue carrying 

incremental pounds of mail through may 31 2006 at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement 

in 2005 the us postal service chose fedex express as the provider of transportation and delivery for the international delivery service called global express guaranteed gxg the service which is available at over 8100 postal locations offers international express delivery with a moneyback guarantee subject to certain limitations customers bring their packages to a us post office where they fill out the gxg air waybill pay postage and fees and drop off their packages the us postal service tenders the packages to fedex express and fedex express provides transportation and delivery to the ultimate international destination 

pricing 

fedex express periodically publishes list prices in its service guides for the majority of its services in general during 2005 us shipping rates were based on the service selected destination zone weight size any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a fedex express courier or dropped off by the customer at a fedex express location international rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size weight and destination fedex express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced 

fedex express has a dynamic fuel surcharge for all us domestic and us outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally where legally and contractually possible the surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel for example the fuel surcharge for june 2005 was based on the spot price for jet fuel published for april 2005 changes to the fedex express fuel surcharge when calculated according to the spot price for jet fuel and fedex express trigger points are applied effective from the first monday of the month these trigger points may change from time to time but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedexcom approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable 

operations 

fedex express’s primary sorting facility located in memphis serves as the center of the company’s multiple hubandspoke system a second national hub is located in indianapolis in addition to these national hubs fedex express operates regional hubs in newark oakland and fort worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in los angeles and chicago facilities in anchorage paris and subic bay philippines serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from asia europe and north america additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at narita airport in tokyo stansted airport outside london and pearson airport in toronto facilities in subic bay and paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas in 2005 fedex express opened a new facility in miami—the miami gateway hub—which serves our south florida latin american and caribbean markets throughout its worldwide network fedex express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area for more information about our sorting and handling facilities see part i item 2 of this annual report on form 10k under the caption “fedex express segment” in some international areas where low package traffic makes fedex express’s direct presence less economical global service participants have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages 

fedex kinko’s offers retail access to fedex express shipping services at all of its us locations and is adding fedex express shipping services at its international locations fedex express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide instore dropoff sites our unmanned fedex drop boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings shopping centers corporate or industrial parks and outside us post offices 

fuel supplies and costs 

during 2005 fedex express purchased aviation fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered the fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily because of our dynamic fuel surcharge we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts see “fedex express — pricing” 

the following table sets forth fedex express’s costs for aviation fuel and its percentage of fedex’s revenues for the last five fiscal years 

   

approximately 14 of fedex express’s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk the remainder of fedex express’s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

we believe that barring a substantial disruption in supplies of crude oil our fuel purchase contracts will ensure the availability of an adequate supply of fuel for fedex express’s needs for the immediate future a substantial reduction of oil supplies from oilproducing regions or refining capacity or other events causing a substantial reduction in the supply of aviation fuel however could have a significant adverse effect on fedex express 

competition 

the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency and capacity of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings competitors in these markets include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” dhl passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns airfreight forwarders and the us postal service 

fedex express’s principal competitors in the international market are dhl ups foreign postal authorities such as deutsche poste and tnt post group freight forwarders passenger airlines and allcargo airlines fedex express currently provides customscleared doortodoor service with custodial control to more international locations than its competitors many of fedex express’s competitors in the international market however are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express 

employees 

david j bronczek is the president and chief executive officer of fedex express which is headquartered in memphis tennessee as of may 31 2005 fedex express employed approximately 87100 permanent fulltime and 51000 permanent parttime employees of which approximately 18 are employed in the memphis area fedex express’s international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 17 of all employees fedex express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent 

the pilots of fedex express are represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” and have been employed under a collective bargaining agreement since may 31 1999 the current agreement did not expire but became amendable on may 31 2004 negotiations with alpa to reach a new labor agreement began in march 2004 and remain underway we will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots 

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a us domestic collective bargaining representative other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees

regulation 

air  under the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended both the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over fedex express

the faa’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation including aircraft standards maintenance and corrosion control as well as personnel and ground facilities which may from time to time affect the ability of fedex express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner fedex express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part 119 of the federal aviation regulations this certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as fedex express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations 

the dot’s authority relates primarily to economic and security aspects of air transportation the dot’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters including the transfer of route authority between carriers fedex express holds various certificates issued by the dot authorizing fedex express to engage in us and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis fedex express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from several points in its us route system to numerous points throughout the world the dot regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of united states air carriers abroad the right of a united states carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the dot’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the united states and the foreign government the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services the regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner 

in 2001 the aviation and transportation security act transferred responsibility for aviation security from the faa to the transportation security administration “tsa” within the dot and ultimately the department of homeland security in november 2004 the tsa proposed new rules enhancing many of the security requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all cargo aircraft because the tsa’s proposed rules are subject to comment any final rules may differ significantly from the proposed rules accordingly it is not yet possible to estimate the impact if any that the adoption of new rules by the tsa or any other additional security requirements may have on our results of operations however it is possible that increased security requirements could impose substantial incremental costs on us and our competitors 

fedex express participates in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program under this program the us department of defense may requisition for military use certain of fedex express’s widebodied aircraft in the event of a declared need including a national emergency fedex express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the craf program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts through its participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with a consortium of other carriers currently contracts with the us government for charter flights 

ground  the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to its air transportation services the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates routes or services of intermodal allcargo 

air carriers and most motor carriers states may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those states that require registration 

the operations of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation 

like other interstate motor carriers our operations are subject to certain dot safety requirements governing interstate operations in addition vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations 

communication  because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations fedex express is subject to the federal communications commission act of 1934 as amended additionally the federal communications commission regulates and licenses fedex express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications

environmental  pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the us environmental protection agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise fedex express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations fedex express’s aircraft are also subject to and are in compliance with the regulations governing engine emissions in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operators have local noise regulations which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day these regulations have had a restrictive effect on fedex express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of fedex express’s significant markets congress’s passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 established a national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints fedex express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates

we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to among other things contingency planning for spills of petroleum products the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in fedex kinko’s copy machines and photo film developing operations additionally we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emissions and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment we have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations 

customs our activities including customs brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security customs brokerage and security issues the us federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot airfreight forwarding our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions

fedex operating strategy 

  

our strategy is to have focused operating companies that excel in each segment of the global transportation and logistics marketplace and to create synergies across companies through coordinated sales and marketing programs enhanced by stateoftheart information technology each subsidiary generally serves a separate and distinct sector of the market we believe that operating independent transportation networks each focused on its own respective markets results in optimal service quality reliability and profitability from each of our businesses each of the fedex subsidiaries is free to focus exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise everything about the companies—the operations the cost structure the policies and the culture—is designed to successfully serve the unique customer needs of a particular market segment 

  

while each of our subsidiaries operates independently completely focused on the distinct needs of its market segment we compete collectively by combining many of the functions that are related to customer communication and information our collective approach also allows customers to select the right network for the right place and at the right price through a single point of access because our subsidiaries compete collectively we have the flexibility to provide customized delivery and logistics solutions for our customers as an example during 2002 fedex trade networks began two new offerings for bundled services fedex trade networks oceanground distribution sm and fedex trade networks airground distributio n sm  by bundling services offered by other fedex operating companies fedex trade networks enables customers to ship from asia and europe to multiple destinations within north america for instance 7eleven inc the world’s largest convenience store retailer used fedex trade networks’ new bundled service to improve its distribution model for holiday products sourced in asia fedex trade networks managed the entire distribution process from origin to destination including freight forwarding by ocean ground transportation using the ltl freight services of fedex freight and small package distribution using fedex ground 

  

fedex services sells and markets the full portfolio of services offered by fedex express and fedex ground and provides customerfacing solutions that meet customer needs we speak to customers with one voice and provide them with a single access point to our services while allowing the operating companies to deliver their services at the lowest cost with the highest level of service we believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units for example our web site fedexcom  provides a single point of contact for our customers to access fedex express and fedex ground package tracking customer service and invoicing information in addition we have combined fedex express and fedex ground domestic shipping functionality on our fedex ® ship manager proprietary computer system and fedex insight sm webbased application this permits customers to use the dedicated computer installed in their offices or fedex software and with a few keystrokes switch between fedex express and fedex ground domestic shipping services and view realtime status information on inbound outbound and thirdparty payor fedex express and fedex ground shipments 

  

our strategy is to leverage and extend one of our greatest assets the fedex brand and to provide our customers with an integrated set of business solutions our customers increasingly want a single solution that can meet all of their global transportation needs our goal is to provide them convenient access to our powerful collection of express ground freight logistics supply chain customs brokerage trade facilitation and electronic commerce solutions 

  

we manage our business as a portfolio as a result we base decisions on capital investment expansion of delivery and information technology networks and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall longterm return on capital for each one of the fedex companies we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and transportation assets necessary to optimize our earnings performance and cash flow 

  

fedex growth strategy 

  

we have developed a strategy for growth that allows us to profit from four trends shaping the new economy 

  

increase in hightech and highvalueadded businesses although recovery in the hightech and highvalueadded goods sectors has lagged the rest of the economy we believe these sectors will experience strong growth as a percentage of total economic activity over the long term information technology alone contributes significantly to real economic growth in the united states and overseas the highvalueadded sector however is broader including pharmaceuticals automotive goods electronics highfashion goods aviation products and other goods with high value per pound our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of hightech and highvalueadded industries 

  

globalization as the world’s economy becomes more fully integrated and as barriers and borders to trade continue to decrease companies are sourcing and selling globally with global sourcing and selling companies have streamlined their supply chains and opened new markets the percentage of united states gross domestic product related to international trade has increased substantially over the past 30 years and continues to grow this in turn has opened multiple legs of transportation on both the inbound “sourcing” side and the outbound “selling” side with customers in 212 countries we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach delivery services and information capabilities 

  

acceleration of the supply chain a supply chain is the series of transportation and information exchanges required to convert raw materials into finished delivered goods the acceleration of companies’ supply chains—the increase of fastcycle logistics—is the third major trend affecting the 

  

new economy as the economy has become increasingly global it has also become more fastpaced companies cannot wait weeks to source components and finished goods from around the world especially in hightech industries with high obsolescence rates so companies of all sizes depend on the delivery of justintime inventory to help them compete faster and more efficiently we believe that the future of logistics will therefore be not in operating brickandmortar warehouses but in providing informationintensive services that increase the value visibility and velocity of the goods in customers’ supply chains we have taken advantage of the move toward faster more efficient supply chains by helping customers substitute near realtime information to manage inventory in motion thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding timetomarket 

  

growth of the internet and ecommerce  ecommerce is a major catalyst of the new economy and remains a vital growth engine for businesses today it makes lowcost standardized information exchange available to anyone with a personal computer regardless of time or space businesstoconsumer ecommerce sales are rapidly growing recent projections by forrester research inc place online retail sales at 5618 billion by 2006 we are leveraging the strength of the fedex portfolio in the businesstoconsumer market through our fedex home delivery service this service provides a moneyback guaranteed lowcost solution to the rapidly increasing number of businesses including etailers who ship large volumes to residential customers while consumer purchases over the internet continue to grow the businesstobusiness ecommerce marketplace is substantially larger businesstobusiness ecommerce is estimated by forrester research to exceed the 122 trillion sales mark by 2006 according to forrester research computers and electronics already two of fedex’s largest customer groups currently account for almost onefourth of this category and supply chains are increasingly moving online 

  

while the momentum of these four macrotrends slowed in the face of recession and in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks we firmly believe these trends are irreversible and have set the stage for full economic recovery we believe that fedex is well positioned to capitalize on these trends resulting in stronger longterm growth productivity and profitability we intend to achieve these goals by a commitment to the following five growth strategies 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

rebranded fedex freight and fedex trade networks companies continue to provide customers with a fuller range of transportation services including bundled services in cooperation with other fedex operating companies in june 2002 fedex freight east launched a pioneering service fedex freight next day plus sm  to assist companies in reducing inventory cycle times with the new moneyback guaranteed service fedex freight east delivers shipments via truck in selected lanes up to 900 miles by the next business day well over the regional ltl industry standard of up to 500 miles by the next day fedex freight next day plus is designed for businesses that are challenged to keep inventories low or to get their products to specific markets consistently ahead of the competition the extended coverage of fedex freight next day plus may allow shippers to trim a day out of their supply chains or even eliminate costly distribution centers while still getting products to market in the time they need

us postal service agreements 

  

under two sevenyear agreements with the us postal service—one for domestic air transportation of postal shipments and the other for placement of fedex drop boxes at us post offices 

  

 

  

 

  

pricing 

  

fedex express periodically publishes list prices in its service guides for the majority of its services in general during 2002 us shipping rates were based on the service selected destination zone weight size any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a fedex express courier or dropped off by the customer at a fedex express location international rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size weight and destination fedex express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced 

  

in november 2001 fedex express implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge which lowered its fuel surcharge to 3 the dynamic fuel surcharge is based on a new index for calculating fuel surcharges on us domestic and us outbound shipments the surcharge which applies to all shipments tendered within the united states all us export shipments and some shipments originating internationally where 

  

legally and contractually possible is subject to adjustment monthly using a rounded average of the us gulf coast “usgc” spot price for a gallon of kerosenetype jet fuel for example the fuel surcharge for june 2002 was based on the usgc spot price for jet fuel published for april 2002 changes to the fedex express fuel surcharge when calculated according to the usgc index and fedex trigger points are applied effective from the first monday of the month these trigger points may change from time to time but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at fedexcom two weeks before the surcharge is applicable during 2002 the dynamic fuel surcharge ranged from 0 to 3 

  

operations 

  

fedex express’s global transportation and distribution services are provided through an extensive worldwide network consisting of numerous aviation and ground transportation operating rights and authorities 647 aircraft approximately 50000 vehicles and trailers sorting facilities fedex world service centers fedex drop boxes fedex shipsites and fedex authorized shipcenters as well as sophisticated package tracking billing and communications systems 

  

fedex express’s primary sorting facility located in memphis serves as the center of the company’s multiple hubandspoke system a second national hub is located in indianapolis in addition to these national hubs fedex express operates regional hubs in newark oakland and fort worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in los angeles and chicago facilities in anchorage paris and subic bay philippines serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from asia europe and north america additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at narita airport in tokyo stansted airport outside london and pearson airport in toronto facilities in subic bay and paris are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas 

  

throughout its worldwide network fedex express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area in some cities fedex express operates fedex world service centers which are staffed store–front facilities located in hightraffic highdensity areas unmanned fedex drop boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages at locations in office buildings shopping centers corporate or industrial parks and outside us post offices fedex express has also formed alliances with certain retailers to extend this customer convenience network to dropoff sites in retail stores in international regions where low package traffic makes fedex express’s direct presence less economical global service participants have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages 

  

fedex express uses an advanced package tracking and tracing system fedex cosmos ®  that utilizes hand–held electronic scanning equipment and computer terminals this system provides proof of delivery information an electronically reproduced airbill for the customer and information regarding the location of a package within fedex express’s system for international shipments fedex express has developed fedex expressclear sm  a worldwide electronic customs clearance system which speeds up customs clearance by allowing customs agents in destination countries to review information about shipments before they arrive 

  

fuel supplies and costs 

  

during 2002 fedex express purchased aviation fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered the fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily 

  

the following table sets forth fedex express’s costs for aviation fuel and its percentage of total operating expense for the last five fiscal years 

  

 

  

in november 2001 fedex express implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge which applies to all shipments tendered within the united states all us export shipments and many shipments originating internationally where legally and contractually possible for a description of the dynamic fuel surcharge see “fedex express—pricing” in past years we entered into jet fuel hedging contracts which were designed to limit our exposure to fluctuations in jet fuel prices under these contracts we made or received payments based on the difference between a specified price and the market price of jet fuel as determined by an index of spot market prices representing various geographic regions the difference was recorded as an increase or decrease in fuel expense we effectively closed our hedge positions during the fourth quarter of 2001 and did not enter into any jet fuel hedging contracts during 2002 to date our dynamic fuel surcharge has obviated the need for jet fuel hedging contracts 

  

approximately 14 of fedex express’s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk the remainder of fedex express’s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts 

  

we believe that barring a substantial disruption in supplies of crude oil our fuel purchase contracts will ensure the availability of an adequate supply of fuel for fedex express’s needs for the immediate future a substantial reduction of oil supplies from oilproducing regions or refining capacity or other events causing a substantial reduction in the supply of aviation fuel however could have a significant adverse effect on fedex express 

  

competition 

  

the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service the ability to compete effectively depends upon price frequency and capacity of scheduled service ability to track packages extent of geographic coverage reliability and innovative service offerings competitors in these markets include other package delivery concerns principally united parcel service inc “ups” dhl worldwide express airborne express passenger airlines offering express package services regional express delivery concerns airfreight forwarders and the us postal service fedex express’s principal competitors in the international market are dhl worldwide express ups foreign postal authorities such as deutsche poste and tnt post group passenger airlines and allcargo airlines 

  

fedex express currently holds certificates of authority to serve more foreign countries than any other united states allcargo air carrier and its extensive scheduled international route system allows it to offer singlecarrier service to many points not offered by its principal allcargo competitors this international route system combined with an integrated air and ground network enables fedex express to offer international customers more extensive singlecarrier service to a greater number of us domestic points than can be provided currently by competitors many of fedex express’s competitors in the international market however are governmentowned controlled or subsidized carriers which may have greater 

  

resources lower costs less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than fedex express 

  

employees 

  

fedex express is headquartered in memphis tennessee david j bronczek is the president and chief executive officer of fedex express as of may 31 2002 fedex express employed approximately 87400 permanent fulltime and 48200 permanent parttime employees of which approximately 20 are employed in the memphis area employees of fedex express’s international branches and subsidiaries in the aggregate represent approximately 16 of all employees fedex express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent 

  

fedex express and its pilots who are currently represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” have been operating under a fiveyear collective bargaining agreement since may 31 1999 the agreement provides in part for a 17 pay increase over the term of the contract 34 average annual increase enhanced retirement benefits direct pilot input on scheduling issues and limits on types of trips scheduled during certain times of the day 

  

attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a domestic collective bargaining representative other than alpa we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect if any on fedex express or its employees

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

  

general 

  

the following management’s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations liquidity and capital resources as well as the critical accounting policies of fedex corporation also referred to as “fedex” this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements which include additional information about our significant accounting policies practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 

  

fedex is one of the largest transportation companies in the world our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units these business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments fedex express the world’s largest express transportation company fedex ground north america’s second largest provider of smallpackage ground delivery service and fedex freight the largest us provider of regional lessthantruckload freight services 

  

the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks as measured by our average daily volume the mix of services purchased by our customers the prices we obtain for our services as measured by average price per shipment yield our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries wages and benefits fuel and maintenance and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 

  

except as otherwise indicated references to years mean our fiscal year ended may 31 2002 or ended may 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year 

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated results 

  

the following table compares revenues operating income net income and diluted earnings per share in millions except per share amounts for the years ended may 31 

  

 

 

  

our 2002 results reflect outstanding revenue and earnings growth at fedex ground operating income at this segment increased 162 million or 93 reflecting volume growth in fedex ground’s core business and reduced losses in its home delivery service the performance of fedex ground and the addition of fedex freight east formerly known as american freightways in the third quarter of 2001 contributed to improved net income for 2002 but were mitigated by continued softness in package volumes at fedex express volume levels in our fedex express domestic and international package services declined in 2002 as a result of continued weakness in the us and global economies particularly 

in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors which has decreased demand for our higherpriced express services revenue from our transportation agreement with the us postal service “usps” which commenced in the first quarter of 2002 as well as effective cost management helped soften the impact of reduced package volumes at fedex express 

  

largely due to the contributions of fedex ground and fedex freight and the fact that 2001 included approximately 124 million in noncash charges discussed below operating income increased significantly in 2002 discretionary spending such as professional fees and travelrelated expenses was reduced approximately 108 million during 2002 pension costs were approximately 90 million higher in 2002 due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets variable compensation was slightly higher in 2002 

  

during 2002 we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at fedex express and fedex ground which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel respectively lower fuel prices during 2002 had a positive impact on operating expenses however declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income conversely fuel surcharge revenue in 2001 more than offset the impact of higher fuel costs during 2001 increased fuel prices negatively impacted yearoveryear expenses by approximately 160 million net of the effects of jet fuel hedging contracts we received approximately 92 million in 2001 under jet fuel hedging contracts which we effectively closed during the fourth quarter of 2001 by entering into offsetting contracts the maturity of these contracts increased 2002 fuel costs by approximately 15 million 

  

net income for 2002 reflects the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in the first quarter this change resulted from adoption of new rules from the financial accounting standards board “fasb” for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets see note 2 and note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements adoption of these new rules resulted in the first quarter recognition of a 25 million 15 million net of tax or 05 per share impairment charge to our recorded goodwill results for 2002 also reflect the cessation of 36 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses as required under the new accounting rules goodwill amortization expense was 26 million for 2001 and 17 million for 2000 

  

our results for 2001 reflected strong performance during the first half which was more than offset by the effects of weakened economic conditions in the second half of the year as a result of lower domestic volumes at fedex express in the second half of 2001 and lowered capacity growth forecasts management committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our md10 program which upgrades and modifies our older dc10 aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer md11 aircraft by curtailing the md10 program we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through 2008 during 2001 we also took actions to reorganize our fedex supply chain services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable nonstrategic logistics business and reduce its overhead in addition due to the bankruptcy of ayres corporation we wrote off deposits and related items in 2001 in connection with the ayres alm200 aircraft program following is a summary of these charges in millions 

  

 

  

results for 2002 were favorably affected by approximately 12 million related to the charges above based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates no material amounts remained on the balance sheet for these items at the end of 2002 

  

excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2001 and 2000 revenues increased slightly in 2001 reflecting revenue growth of fedex international priority ® “ip” packages during 2001 volume growth was higher at fedex ground as this subsidiary continued to grow its core business and expand its new home delivery service offering the effects of the acquisition of fedex freight east added approximately 630 million to 2001 revenues the acquisition resulted in recognition of approximately 600 million in goodwill and was slightly accretive to 2001 earnings per diluted share for further information regarding this acquisition see “liquidity” and note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements 

  

our 2001 operating results reflected the continuing implementation of the rebranding and reorganization initiatives begun in the last half of 2000 to leverage the fedex name and centralize certain sales marketing and technology functions of fedex express and fedex ground into fedex services see “reportable segments” below these rebranding costs did not have a significant impact on 2002 results and were approximately 26 million for 2001 and 21 million for 2000 our 2001 results included a significant reduction in operating costs related to reduced provisions under our variable compensation plans pension costs were approximately 70 million lower in 2001 due principally to higher discount rates 

  

other income and expense and income taxes 

  

interest expense was slightly lower in 2002 as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year see “financial condition” below financing for the acquisition of fedex freight east which was completed in the third quarter of 2001 was the principal reason net interest expense was 36 higher in 2001 

  

in 2002 other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately 17 million from the retirement of debt assumed in the fedex freight east acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations other nonoperating expenses in 2000 included gains of approximately 12 million from an insurance settlement for a destroyed md11 aircraft and approximately 11 million from the sale of securities 

  

our effective tax rate was 375 in 2002 370 in 2001 and 395 in 2000 the 375 effective tax rate in 2002 was higher than the 2001 effective rate primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in 2001 the 2002 rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization as discussed above and by several other factors none of which were individually significant the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory us federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes for 2003 we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 380 the actual rate however will depend on a number of factors including the amount and source of operating income 

  

at may 31 2002 we had a net deferred tax liability of 130 million consisting of 1 billion of deferred tax assets and 11 billion of deferred tax liabilities the reversal of deferred tax assets in future periods is expected to be offset by similar amounts of deferred tax liabilities 

  

terrorist attacks of september 11 

  

fiscal 2002 second quarter operations were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 all domestic fedex express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on september 11 and 12 and flight operations resumed on the evening of september 13 2001 during the period our aircraft were grounded both domestic and international shipments were impacted with domestic average daily express volumes declining almost 50 from prior year levels we executed contingency plans and transported all domestic shipments during this period through groundbased 

trucking operations we resumed air operations within hours of receiving clearance from the federal aviation administration business levels at fedex ground and fedex freight were not materially affected 

  

in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 the us congress passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the “act” an emergency economic assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the nation’s air carriers the act provides for 5 billion to be used for financial assistance to airlines to offset losses caused by service disruptions and declines in business activity related to these attacks for the period september 11 2001 through december 31 2001 

  

the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf 0110 “accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001” in september 2001 to establish accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 under eitf 0110 federal assistance provided to air carriers in the form of direct compensation from the us government under the act should be recognized when the related losses are incurred and compensation under the act is probable we recognized 119 million of compensation under the act in 2002 we have classified all amounts recognized under this program of which 101 million was received as of may 31 2002 as a reduction of operating expenses under the caption “airline stabilization compensation” while we believe we have complied with all aspects of the act and that it is probable we will ultimately receive the remaining 18 million receivable compensation previously recognized is subject to audit and interpretation by the department of transportation “dot” we have received requests from the dot for additional information in support of our claims under the act and have responded fully to these requests we cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome of such interpretations but it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the amount of compensation recognized by us under the act could occur 

  

although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may have on our results of operations or financial position furthermore we are not certain how the events of september 11 or any subsequent terrorist activities will ultimately impact the us and global economies in general and the air transportation industry in particular and what effects these events will have on our costs or on the demand for our services 

  

outlook 

  

on may 31 2002 we announced our firstever payment of a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of 05 per share we expect to continue these quarterly cash dividend payments although each subsequent dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 

  

the economic downturn that began in calendar 2001 provided opportunities for management teams within the fedex family to examine growth strategies and take steps to rightsize our transportation networks improve service and provide choices to fit our customers’ transportation needs we believe we are well positioned for longterm growth when the economy particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors recovers and experiences sustained growth 

  

for 2003 we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of an economic stabilization during the first half of 2003 and a recovery during the remainder of the year are realized 

  

our diverse portfolio of services is the key factor to our longterm growth the expansion of fedex ground’s home delivery network and continued development and crossselling of the diverse fedex portfolio of services particularly to small and mediumsized businesses is central to our strategy our web site fedexcom  is heavily utilized and has helped us reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction management believes that our substantially fixed cost infrastructure will allow us to realize incremental profits when the economy recovers 

  

pension costs are expected to continue to increase over the near term our pension cost for 2003 will increase by approximately 90 million due to lower interest rates in 2002 and the effects of decreased returns on pension plan assets for 2003 we will lower our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 109 to 101 while employee retirement costs continue to rise our retirement programs are well funded with assets sufficient to meet our current obligations 

  

maintenance costs are expected to be higher in 2003 due to scheduled maintenance activities higher group health and other insurance costs are also anticipated in spite of the impact of these increased expenses we expect our operating margin to slightly improve as a result of continued focus on cost reductions including hiring restrictions and reduced discretionary spending productivity improvements and a reduction in the fedex home delivery loss 

  

actual results for 2003 will depend upon a number of factors including the timing speed and magnitude of the economic recovery our ability to match capacity with volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives in addition our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before the surcharges are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount see “forwardlooking statements” for a more complete description of potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future performance 

  

seasonality of business 

  

our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature historically the us package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to us market peaks in october and november due to us holiday sales our first and third fiscal quarters because they are summer vacation and post winterholiday seasons have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods 

  

the transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage revenues and earnings normally the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground and fedex custom critical while the latter part of december january june and july of each year are the slowest periods for fedex freight the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of december january and february of each year are the slowest periods shipment levels operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no “sfas” 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” in june 2001 and sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” in october 2001 these statements will be effective for fedex beginning in 2003 we do not expect the application of these new accounting standards to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations see note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

reportable segments 

  

our reportable operating segments are fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight each of which operates in a single line of business included within “other” are the operations of fedex custom critical fedex trade networks and fedex services “other” also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income 

  

the formation of fedex services at the beginning of 2001 represented the implementation of a business strategy that combined the sales marketing and information technology functions of our fedex express and fedex ground reportable segments to form a shared services company that supports the package businesses of both of these segments fedex services provides our customers with a single point of contact for all express and ground services prior to the formation of fedex services each business had its own selfcontained sales marketing and information technology functions 

  

the costs for these activities are now allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided these allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions the line item “intercompany charges” on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from fedex services to fedex express and fedex ground and certain other costs such as corporate management fees 

  

fedex express 

  

the following table compares revenues operating expenses and operating income dollars in millions and selected statistics in thousands except yield amounts for the years ended may 31 

  

 

  

 

    

  

fedex express revenues 

  

volumes at fedex express continue to be below levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown which began in 2001 volumes were also significantly impacted by the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 all domestic fedex express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on september 11 and 12 and flight operations resumed on the evening of september 13 2001 both domestic and international shipments were impacted by this event 

  

during 2002 total package revenue decreased 6 principally due to decreases in volumes in the united states package revenue declined 7 on 6 lower average daily domestic express package volume principally in us overnight box and envelope volumes while ip volume decreased slightly in 2002 principally due to a decline in us outbound shipments ip volumes were positively impacted by the european and asian economies although volumes in these markets did not grow as much as in 2001 for 2002 fedex express experienced ip average daily volume growth rates of 15 and 5 in the european and asian markets respectively package yields are slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue in the second quarter of 2002 we implemented a new index for determining our fuel surcharge using this new index the fuel surcharge ranged between 0 and 3 from november 2001 through may 2002 the fuel surcharge during all of 2001 was 4 

  

in 2001 total package revenue increased 5 principally due to increases in yields and ip volumes the increase in yields in 2001 was a result of yieldmanagement which included limiting growth of less profitable business and recovering the higher cost of fuel through a fuel surcharge domestic rate 

increases in february 2001 also contributed to the higher yield during 2001 while the ip volume growth was 8 for 2001 this rate was impacted by a yearoveryear increase in us outbound shipments offset by weakness in the asian economy in the last half of the year for 2001 fedex express experienced ip average daily volume growth rates of 24 in the european market and 12 in the asian market 

  

total freight revenue for 2002 increased significantly due to improved domestic freight volume and yield reflecting the impact of the usps transportation agreement which began in august 2001 on january 10 2001 fedex express and the usps entered into two service contracts one for domestic air transportation and the other for placement of fedex drop boxes at us post offices on december 13 2001 we signed an addendum to our transportation agreement with the usps effective for a 10month period beginning january 1 2002 which allows us to carry incremental pounds of mail at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement in 2001 total freight revenue increased slightly over 2000 due to significantly improved yields in us freight partially offset by declines in domestic freight volume and international freight volume and yield 

  

other revenue which includes canadian domestic revenue charter services logistics services sales of hushkits and other increased 10 in 2002 in 2001 and 2000 other revenue decreased mostly due to declines in the sale of hushkits hushkits sales were insignificant in 2002 

  

fedex express operating income 

  

in 2002 operating income at fedex express decreased 4 excluding 102 million of asset impairment charges taken in 2001 operating income was down 15 in 2002 revenue declines in 2002 on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions during 2002 contractual reimbursements received from the usps substantially offset network expansion costs incurred principally in increased salaries usps reimbursements during 2002 are reflected as a credit to other operating expenses this reimbursement however had no effect on operating income as it represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred in 2002 fedex express recognized 27 million of operating income from the resolution of certain state tax matters which is also reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses 

  

operating income for 2002 also reflects the adoption of new rules from the fasb for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in “consolidated results” above for fedex express adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of 12 million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 this amortization amount is comparable to 2001 and 2000 

  

rentals and landing fees were higher in 2002 primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental domestic freight volume while fuel usage was higher in 2002 due to incremental freight pounds transported under the usps agreement fuel costs were down as the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel decreased 12 in 2002 during 2001 increased fuel expense reflected a 17 increase in average jet fuel price per gallon which contributed to a negative impact of approximately 150 million including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts entered into to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs 

  

for 2002 salaries wages and benefits were higher in spite of reductions in hours and fulltime equivalents which were not sufficient to offset base salary increases and higher pension and medical costs this is partially because a significant portion of incremental cost increases related to the usps contract is reflected in salaries and wages pension costs at fedex express were approximately 60 million higher in 2002 profit sharing and incentive compensation provisions were down significantly for 2002 

  

in 2001 operating income decreased 6 reflecting charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter see “consolidated results” above excluding these charges operating income increased 5 in 2001 despite a slowdown in revenue growth that year as reduced variable compensation and pension costs coupled with intensified cost controls over discretionary spending had a positive impact declining contributions from sales of hushkits negatively impacted operating profit by 40 million in 2001 

  

fedex express outlook 

  

while we believe economic growth during the first half of 2003 will be slow particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors we expect revenue to increase during 2003 in both the domestic and international markets revenue growth is expected to exceed expense growth due to increases in both domestic and international package volumes and yield 

  

operating margin for this segment is expected to increase in 2003 despite increasing pension and health care costs insurance expenses maintenance costs and costs associated with annual wage increases our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued cost control efforts with a particular focus on significant improvements in productivity and transportation network efficiency we will also benefit in 2003 from a full year of operations under our transportation contract with the usps 

  

although fuel price increases are anticipated during 2003 they are not expected to significantly impact earnings as our fuel surcharge is closely linked to prevailing market prices for jet fuel our fuel surcharge has a lag that exists before it is adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount 

  

fedex ground 

  

the following table compares revenues operating expenses and operating income dollars in millions and selected package statistics in thousands except yield amounts for the years ended may 31 

  

 

 

  

fedex ground revenues 

  

core business growth and the increasing popularity of our new home delivery service helped fedex ground realize doubledigit revenue growth in both 2002 and 2001 as volumes and yields increased sales and marketing activities have been effective in attracting new small and mediumsized customers which generate higher yielding package revenues for 2002 and 2001 the increase in average daily packages represents positive volume growth experienced in all principal markets served by fedex ground including fedex home delivery which added facilities to reach almost 90 coverage of the us population 

  

in 2002 and 2001 yearoveryear yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages in the third quarter of 2002 we implemented a new dynamic fuel surcharge which is indexed to the current price of diesel fuel using this new index the fuel surcharge ranged between 50 and 75 from february through may 2002 a 125 fuel surcharge was in effect for most of 2001 

  

fedex ground operating income 

  

fedex ground’s operating income significantly increased in 2002 primarily due to package volume growth higher yields productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management fedex home delivery had a loss of 32 million in 2002 which is a significant improvement from the loss in 2001 facility openings and expansions as well as increased investments in information systems resulted in increased depreciation rental and other propertyrelated expenses during 2002 salaries wages and benefits also were higher in 2002 due to additional fulltime equivalents and higher pension and medical costs costs for our variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during 2002 reflecting fedex ground’s outstanding financial performance 

  

during 2001 operating income decreased 23 primarily due to a fedex home delivery operating loss of 52 million and rebranding and reorganization expenses of 15 million the rebranding and reorganization expenses consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans trailers and signage such costs were expensed as incurred excluding the negative impact of these expenses operating income decreased 2 from 2000 facility openings and expansions as well as increased investments in information systems resulted in higher depreciation rental and other propertyrelated expenses during 2001 

  

fedex home delivery launched in march 2000 negatively affected 2000 operating income by approximately 19 million 

  

fedex ground outlook 

  

for 2003 volumes and yield are expected to grow in both the core business and fedex home delivery fedex ground will continue expansion of the fedex home delivery network to serve nearly 100 of the us population by midseptember 2002 plans for 2003 will be focused on improvements in ontime delivery productivity and safety 

  

total operating profit for fedex ground is expected to improve over 2002 although we expect operating margin to decrease because fedex ground will absorb a larger portion of allocated sales marketing customer support and information technology costs during 2003 during 2003 we expect the operating loss from fedex home delivery to improve with this service becoming profitable sometime in 2004 

  

fedex freight 

  

the following table shows revenues operating expenses and operating income in millions and selected statistics for the years ended may 31 

  

 

  

  

although revenues were higher in 2002 due to the inclusion of a full year of operations revenues were impacted by lower than expected volumes due to the economic slowdown and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge the fedex freight fuel surcharge is tied to the “retail on highway diesel fuel price” as published by the us department of energy and changes weekly based on changes in the index in 2002 average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year weight per shipment was down 2 and revenue per hundredweight was up 5 

  

during this difficult economic environment fedex freight improved yields and managed costs operating margins were 86 in 2002 reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization and stable pricing partially offset by the impact of 6 million of rebranding expenses primarily for tractors and trailers our focus on providing superior service to attract and maintain customers solidified our leadership position in the regional lessthantruckload “ltl” market 

  

operating income for fedex freight in 2002 reflects the adoption of new rules from the fasb for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in “consolidated results” above for fedex freight adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of 15 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 for 2001 goodwill amortization recorded by fedex freight was 6 million reflecting the acquisition of fedex freight east in january 2001 

  

fedex freight outlook 

  

we announced in february 2002 that fedex freight east formerly known as american freightways and fedex freight west formerly known as viking freight are being rebranded under the name “fedex freight” we believe this will allow us to take advantage of the fedex brand and create additional synergies which will give us a competitive advantage and continue to improve our market share in the ltl segment the rebranding expenses will consist primarily of incremental external costs 

for rebranding tractors and trailers which will be expensed as incurred the cost of the rebranding is expected to increase fedex freight’s operating expenses by approximately 15 million in 2003 we expect a total of approximately 40 to 45 million to be spent on rebranding at fedex freight through 2005 

  

the complementary geographic regions served by fedex freight east and fedex freight west are expected to have a positive impact on results of operations for this segment both companies will continue to focus on daydefinite regional ltl service but will also collaborate to serve customers who have multiregional ltl needs 

  

in june 2002 we announced a series of new premium service offerings including optional moneyback guaranteed transit times in the west and expanded nextday coverage up to 900 miles in selected lanes in the east these new service offerings will provide our customers with additional shipping options on june 27 2002 we announced a general rate increase of 59 to be effective july 22 2002 yield management enhanced productivity and costcontrol measures continue to be major focus areas for fedex freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment 

  

other operations 

  

other operations include fedex custom critical a criticalshipment carrier fedex trade networks whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company fedex services a provider of supply chain management services and sales marketing and it support for fedex express and fedex ground and certain unallocated corporate items also included in this category are the operating results of fedex freight west prior to december 1 2000 

  

revenues from other operations were 609 million down 40 in 2002 compared to 10 billion in 2001 and 12 billion in 2000 during 2002 a significant portion of the decrease in revenues reflects the fact that current year results for this category no longer include fedex freight west’s revenues see “fedex freight” above in both 2002 and 2001 revenues at fedex custom critical were down 24 largely due to the economic downturn the demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary critical shipments is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators principally in the automotive industry where volumes have been depressed since calendar 2001 

  

operating income from other operations was 5 million in 2002 compared to an operating loss of 6 million in 2001 and operating income of 95 million in 2000 the improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflects reduced operating costs at fedex supply chain services the decrease in operating income in 2001 over 2000 reflects the effect of the economic slowdown on fedex custom critical during 2001 which had strong earnings growth in 2000 and lower performance of fedex supply chain services operating income in 2000 had strong earnings from fedex freight west and also included a 10 million favorable adjustment related to estimated future lease costs from a 1997 restructuring at fedex freight west 

  

on march 1 2002 a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies inc which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for fedex express in three us locations at a cost of 365 million 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements in many cases there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large global corporation however even under optimal circumstances estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 

  

the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing a company’s overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue bill customers and collect amounts due to us 

  

we recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or for our logistics and trade services businesses upon the completion of services in addition transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period 1 recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or 2 recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred we use the second method we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred we believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred 

  

there are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above 1 estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered 2 estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit and 3 estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts 

  

unbilled revenue primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice at the end of a month unprocessed invoices may be as much as onethird of the total month’s revenue this revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes most of these accruals are represented by invoices that are essentially complete with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued the remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment these estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced 

  

shipments in process the majority of our shipments have short cycle times and therefore less than 5 of a total month’s revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period at monthend we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up the scheduled day of delivery the day of the week on which the month ends which affects the percentage of completion and current trends in our average price for the respective services we believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period 

  

future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable like many companies we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable historically our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective we also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts money back service guarantees and billing corrections 

  

estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts adjustments processed and current collections trends allowances for these future adjustments aggregated 147 million at may 31 2002 and 137 million at may 31 2001 we consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate as changes in economic conditions pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances 

  

pension cost 

  

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates which include employee turnover mortality and retirement ages discount rates expected longterm investment returns on plan assets and future salary increases we consider the most critical of these to be our discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected longterm rate of return is applied and the rate of future increases in salaries 

  

for fedex many of these assumptions are highly sensitive in the determination of a year’s pension cost because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans for example fewer than 5 of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits therefore the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future this longtime period increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our pension cost total pension costs increased approximately 90 million in 2002 and are expected to increase an additional 90 million in 2003 

  

discount rate  this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation the discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date february 28 and affects the succeeding year’s pension cost a decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense this assumption is highly sensitive as a onebasispoint change in the discount rate affects our pension expense by approximately 1 million for example the 60basispoint decrease in the discount rate to 71 for 2002 from 77 for 2001 will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately 60 million 

  

we determine the discount rate which is meant to be the current rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled with the assistance of actuaries who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of highgrade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments this methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity however the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds 

  

plan assets the estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a longterm assumption that also materially affects our pension cost with over 55 billion of plan assets a onebasispoint change in this assumption directly affects pension cost by approximately 600000 a decrease in the assumed expected longterm rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense 

  

our 2002 expected longterm rate of return of 109 reflects our active investment management program which has consistently outperformed the related market indices over the past ten years also because of our relatively young workforce we are able to maintain more of our pension assets invested in higherreturning longerterm equity investments while plan investments are subject to shortterm volatility they are well diversified and the asset portfolios are closely managed we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly based on recent trends in asset performance and generally lower risk premiums in equity markets we lowered the expected longterm rate of return for 2003 to 101 this 80basispoint decrease in the expected longterm rate of return will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately 48 million further adjustments to this estimate may be necessary in the future 

  

investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected longterm rate of return is applied which will further increase our pension cost in 2003 despite poor asset performance over the past two years that has generated investment losses our pension plan is and will continue to be appropriately funded to meet the payment of benefits as such obligations become due 

  

pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date we use a calculated value method which helps mitigate shortterm volatility in market performance both increases and decreases the application of this accounting policy reduced 2002 pension cost by approximately 16 million 

  

salary increases the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost we correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments and general estimated levels of profitability incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages a onebasispoint change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately 700000 a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost thus the decrease in the assumption to 33 at the end of 2002 from 40 will favorably impact 2003 pension cost by approximately 50 million 

  

selfinsurance accruals 

  

we are selfinsured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims vehicle accident and general business liabilities and benefits paid under employee health care programs at may 31 2002 we had total selfinsurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet of approximately 839 million 776 million at may 31 2001 

  

the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim we account for these costs primarily 

through actuarial methods which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred including those claims incurred but not reported these methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 

  

we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis nevertheless changes in health costs accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 

  

longlived assets 

  

property and equipment our key businesses are capital intensive over 60 of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards accordingly repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 

  

the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods over 20 years for certain of our aircraft equipment we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated lives or salvage values are necessary the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset historically gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material typically less than 10 million annually however such amounts may differ materially in the future based on technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory requirements and other factors beyond our control 

  

because we must plan for future volume levels for multiple years in order to make commitments for aircraft based on those projections we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 

  

however from time to time we make decisions to remove certain longlived assets from service based on projections of capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment for example in 2001 we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at fedex express related to our md10 conversion program the decision allowed us to avoid approximately 11 billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of 93 million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated disposal value the estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal during 2002 we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired md10 program assets which resulted in a favorable adjustment of 9 million 

  

leases we utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft over the years we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor as disclosed in “contractual cash obligations” below and note 7 to the 

accompanying audited financial statements at may 31 2002 we had approximately 15 billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitments for operating leases 

  

the future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life we believe we have welldefined and controlled processes for making this evaluation 

  

goodwill we have in excess of 1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses new accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization as previously indicated the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of 25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates however once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded it cannot be reversed 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity 

  

we reached a significant milestone in 2002 as we declared our firstever cash dividend on may 31 2002 we announced that shareholders of record as of the close of business on june 17 2002 will be paid a 05 cash dividend per share of common stock we expect to continue these quarterly dividend payments although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 

  

cash and cash equivalents totaled 331 million at may 31 2002 compared to 121 million at may 31 2001 the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended may 31 in millions 

  

 

  

the following cashbased measure is presented as an additional means of evaluating our financial condition because we incur significant noncash charges including depreciation and amortization related to the material capital assets utilized in our business this measure should not be considered as a superior alternative to net income operating income cash from operations or any other operating or liquidity performance measure as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the following table compares ebitda as adjusted earnings before goodwill accounting changes interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the years ended may 31 in billions 

  

 

  

the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2002 reflects increases in ebitda as adjusted which includes fedex freight for an entire year and aggressive working capital management in 2001 the addition of fedex freight east improved cash provided by operating activities for that year 

  

cash used for capital investments capital expenditures during 2002 were lower primarily at fedex express where capital expenditures were 14 lower due to our efforts at the end of 2001 to match our planned spending with anticipated volume levels we have taken various actions to reduce future capital expenditures over the past two years including those related to the curtailment of our md10 program discussed in “consolidated results” above and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase 19 md11 aircraft from an affiliate of sairgroup these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 21 billion in future capital expenditures during 2002 we continued to make investments in fedex ground’s infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand fedex freight see “capital resources” below for further discussion 

  

cash used for business acquisitions during 2002 a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies inc that provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for fedex express in three us locations during 2001 we acquired fedex freight east for approximately 980 million with a combination of cash and fedex common stock during 2000 we acquired three businesses for approximately 264 million primarily in cash see note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of business combinations 

  

free cash flow cash flow from operations during 2002 exceeded our cash used for investing activities creating free cash flow of 616 million with which we paid off over 300 million in debt and repurchased treasury shares the achievement of positive free cash flow is attributable to management of capital expenditures and working capital positive free cash flow indicates excess funds are available to invest in operations reduce outstanding debt and provide return on capital to our shareholders 

  

debt financing activities at april 1 2002 certain existing debt at fedex express matured principally 175 million of 9875 senior notes also in the fourth quarter of 2002 we prepaid the remaining 101 million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of fedex freight east 

  

in the third quarter of 2001 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches three five and ten years at 250 million each net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness principally borrowings under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes these notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under securities and exchange commission “sec” regulations  

  

we currently have 1 billion in revolving bank credit facilities that are generally used to finance temporary operating cash requirements and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper as of may 31 2002 we had no commercial paper outstanding and the entire credit facilities were available for more information regarding these credit facilities see note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements 

  

during 2002 we filed a 10 billion shelf registration statement with the sec to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing under this shelf registration statement we may issue in one or more offerings either unsecured debt securities common stock or a combination of such instruments 

  

cash used for share repurchases we repurchased approximately 33 million shares of our common stock in 2002 at a cost of approximately 177 million under our 50 million share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2002 the board of directors authorized us to buy back an additional 50 million shares of common stock there were no treasury share repurchases during 2001 and during 2000 cash flows were affected by approximately 607 million from the repurchase of 15 million shares 

  

other liquidity information we will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to achieve positive free cash flow in the future we believe that cash flow from operations our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 

  

capital resources 

  

we have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems in recent years we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become fedex ground fedex freight fedex custom critical and fedex trade networks the sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until 2002 with the infrastructure and operating systems now largely in place we have been able to reduce our capital spending including equivalent capital as defined below since 2000 

  

despite the decrease in capital spending our operations remain capital intensive characterized by significant investments in aircraft vehicles computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment packagehandling facilities and sort equipment the amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors including preexisting contractual commitments anticipated volume growth domestic and international economic conditions new or enhanced services geographical expansion of services competition availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities 

  

the following table compares capital expenditures including equivalent capital for the years ended may 31 in millions 

  

 

 

  

 see note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment 

  

in 2002 in spite of capital spending related to the 2001 addition of fedex freight east as well as scheduled deliveries of aircraft that were planned and committed to well before the economic slowdown management’s costreduction actions resulted in a decrease in capital spending compared to both 2001 and 2000 for 2003 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 19 billion as we are required to take 17 aircraft committed to in prior years because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance therefore we must make projections regarding our needed airlift capacity many years before aircraft are actually needed we will continue to manage our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible in order to achieve positive cash flow 

  

on july 12 2002 fedex express entered into an agreement with avsa sarl for the purchase of ten airbus a380800f aircraft a new highcapacity longrange airplane we expect to take delivery of three of the ten aircraft in each of the years 2008 2009 and 2010 and the remaining one in 2011 the total commitment under the agreement approximates 2 billion most of the purchase price of each aircraft is due upon delivery of the aircraft the agreement also provides for an option to purchase an additional ten aircraft 

  

we have historically financed our longterm capital investments through the use of lease debt and equity financing in addition to the use of internally generated cash from operations the determination to lease versus buy equipment is a financing decision and all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital the amount we would have expended to purchase these assets had we not chosen to obtain their use through operating leases leases with terms in excess of 50 of the asset’s useful life is considered equivalent capital in the table above and is included in our internal capital budget we had no equivalent capital expenditures during 2002 or 2001 

  

we finance a significant amount of our aircraft needs and certain other equipment needs using operating leases a type of “offbalance sheet financing” certain of these operating leases were arranged using special purpose entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry at the time that the decision to lease was made we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values liquidity and aftertax cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet however the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements as well as in “contractual cash obligations” below 

  

credit rating agencies routinely use the information concerning our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity furthermore our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases 

  

in the future other forms of secured financing may be pursued to finance aircraft acquisitions if we determine that it best suits our needs we have been successful in obtaining investment capital both domestic and international for longterm leases on acceptable terms although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors we believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions including aircraft and are adequate for our future capital needs for information on our purchase commitments see note 15 of the accompanying audited financial statements as well as the table below 

  

contractual cash obligations 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may 31 2002 certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

 

    

  

in addition we have other commercial commitments incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations including surety bonds and standby letters of credit these instruments are generally required under certain selfinsurance programs while the notional amounts of these instruments are material there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the liabilities for these selfinsurance programs are already reflected in our balance sheet as accrued expenses and other longterm liabilities we also have guarantees amounting to 137 million at may 31 2002 under certain operating leases for the residual values of aircraft vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods these guarantees are not reflected in our balance sheet since they are not currently considered probable therefore they do not represent liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

euro currency conversion 

  

since the beginning of the european union’s transition to the euro on january 1 1999 our subsidiaries have been prepared to quote rates to customers generate billings and accept payments in both euro and legacy currencies the legacy currencies remained legal tender through january 1 2002 we did not experience a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from the introduction of the euro and any price transparency brought about by its introduction and the phasing out of the legacy currencies costs associated with the euro project were expensed as incurred and were funded entirely by internal cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our longterm debt because the interest rates are fixed we have outstanding longterm debt exclusive of capital leases of 16 billion and 19 billion at may 31 2002 and 2001 respectively market risk for fixedrate longterm debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately 49 million as of may 31 2002 and 55 million as of may 31 2001 the underlying fair values of our longterm debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities currently derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk 

  

while we are a global provider of transportation services the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars the distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by foreign currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar and japanese yen foreign currency fluctuations during 2002 did not have a material effect on our results of operations at may 31 2002 the result of a uniform 10 strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately 30 million for the year ending may 31 2003 the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately 70 million this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 

  

in practice our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations therefore the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 

  

we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel however this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges in 2002 we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel therefore a hypothetical 10 change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings however our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount 

  

for 2001 market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2002 usage and amounted to approximately 100 million net of hedging settlements as of may 31 2001 all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts see notes 1 and 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts 

  

we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
