 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operations 

the coronavirus global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate results of operations financial condition liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions 

we continue to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic the outbreak of covid19 and any other significant outbreak of epidemic pandemic or contagious disease could have a negative effect on our ability to operate results of operations financial condition liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions in addition the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and the end markets for many of our products which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak 

our global manufacturing facilities remain open with a focus on safety protocols though a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control have restricted our ability to keep our manufacturing facilities fully operational any decline or lower than expected demand in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and suppliers in the future or their ability to purchase company products may delay customers’ purchasing decisions result in a shift to lowerpriced products or away from discretionary products and may result in longer payment terms or inability to collect customer payments these issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity particularly our cash flows from operations financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions 

in compliance with stayathome orders issued in connection with the covid19 pandemic a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home as a result more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and it security may be less robust this change may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security which could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues 

if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines or absenteeism government actions facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages limited supplies or resources or other circumstances related to covid19 our operations will be further impacted we may be unable to perform fully on our customer obligations and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result the continued spread of covid19 may also affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and our ability in short periods to fully maintain and support our corporate culture 

a scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the covid19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments andor other entities to take actions that may have significant negative impact on the company its suppliers and its customers to conduct business in the future risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending which impact domestic and crossborder spend are described in our risk factor titled “foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations” 

the duration and intensity of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain but could have a material impact on our operations cash flows financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions we will continue to assess the financial impact of the pandemic on our business 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements a number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our operational excellence initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industries these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2021 and 2020 represented 495 and 487 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future as of december 31 2021 we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic germany mexico serbia and the united kingdom a disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase manufacture or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

• imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions including in the united states 

• overlap of different tax structures 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including in the united states 

• trade protection measures such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers including in the united states 

• the difficulty andor costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases 

• restrictions on currency repatriation 

• general economic conditions 

• unstable political situations and social unrest both internationally and in the united states 

• nationalization of assets and 

• compliance with a wide variety of international and us laws and regulatory requirements 

furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a disruption in shortage of or price increases for supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components including semiconductor chips and other electronic 

components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition our facilities supply chains distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including armed conflict damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments damage our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees stockholders and others result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses furthermore certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products for example we are subject to federal state and international privacy laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig in the aerospace markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events in any such circumstances our system 

redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate further given a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home disaster recovery may take longer to complete 

attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements although we maintain cyber risk insurance damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

risks related to our acquisitions 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

• our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates 

• the impact of increased competition for acquisitions which may increase acquisition costs affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities 

• successfully integrating acquired businesses including integrating the management technological and operational processes procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations 

• adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us 

• unexpected losses of key employees customers and suppliers of acquired businesses 

• mitigating assumed contingent and unknown liabilities and 

• challenges in managing the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

risks related to our financial condition 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and 

regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2021 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 86074 million or 72 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

our top priority during this pandemic is the health and safety of our employees all global manufacturing facilities remained fully operational during 2021 and continue to operate with safety protocols in place to ensure the health and safety of our employees and communities we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on its business please refer to risk factors part i item 1a of this form 10k for more information

environmental matters 

information with respect to environmental matters is set forth in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the company’s historical experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used below are the policies used in preparing the companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions a complete list of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

• business combinations the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company including when applicable the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed estimating fair values requires significant judgments estimates and assumptions including but not limited to discount rates future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names technology and customer relationships these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 

• goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the 

company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2021 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 118 to 534 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using an appropriate discount rate each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates certain impairment models have discount rates calculated based on a debtequity cost of capital while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded intangible balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2021 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 61131 million or 514 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

• pensions the company has us and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans the most significant elements in determining the company’s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date at the end of each year the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities in estimating this rate for 2021 the company considered rates of return on highquality fixedincome investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan in estimating the us and foreign discount rates the company’s actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of longterm bonds at consistent maturity dates the company determines the expected longterm rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans’ investments additionally the 

company considers historical returns on comparable fixedincome and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate 

• income taxes the process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the company’s tax assets and liabilities to the extent the final outcome differs future adjustments to the company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary 

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 recent accounting pronouncements to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operations 

the coronavirus global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate results of operations financial condition liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a global pandemic the outbreak of covid19 and any other significant outbreak of epidemic pandemic or contagious disease could have a negative effect on our ability to operate results of operations financial condition liquidity and ability to consummate future acquisitions in addition the outbreak of covid19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and the end markets for many of our products which could result in an economic downturn that may negatively affect demand for our products the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the severity of the disease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak 

our global manufacturing facilities remain open with a focus on safety protocols though a range of external factors related to the pandemic that are not within our control have restricted our ability to keep our manufacturing facilities fully operational additionally while our global supply chains are currently not materially affected it is unknown whether and to what extent they may be affected if the covid19 pandemic persists for an extended period any decline or lower than expected demand in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and suppliers in the future or their ability to purchase company products may delay customers’ purchasing decisions result in a shift to lowerpriced products or away from discretionary products and may result in longer payment terms or inability to collect customer payments these issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity particularly our cash flows from operations financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions 

in compliance with stayathome orders issued in connection with the covid19 pandemic a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home as a result more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and it security may be less robust this change may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents including breaches of information systems security which could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues 

if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines or absenteeism government actions facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages limited supplies or resources or other circumstances related to covid19 our operations will be further impacted we may be unable to perform fully on our customer obligations and we may incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result the continued spread of covid19 may also affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and our ability in short periods to fully maintain and support our corporate culture 

a scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the covid19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments andor other entities to take actions that may have significant negative impact on the company its suppliers and its customers to conduct business in the future risks related to consumers and businesses lowering or changing spending which impact domestic and crossborder spend are described in our risk factor titled “foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations” 

the duration and intensity of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to our operations is uncertain but could have a material impact on our operations cash flows financial condition and ability to consummate future acquisitions we will continue to assess the financial impact of the pandemic on our business 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements a number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our 

businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our operational excellence initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industries these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2020 and 2019 represented 487 and 480 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future as of december 31 2020 we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic germany mexico serbia and the united kingdom a disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase manufacture or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

• imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions including in the united states 

• overlap of different tax structures 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including in the united states 

• trade protection measures such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers including in the united states 

• the difficulty andor costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases 

• restrictions on currency repatriation 

• general economic conditions 

• unstable political situations and social unrest both internationally and in the united states 

• nationalization of assets and 

• compliance with a wide variety of international and us laws and regulatory requirements 

furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our 

consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a disruption in shortage of or price increases for supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition our facilities supply chains distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including armed conflict damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees stockholders and others result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses furthermore certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products for example we are subject to federal state and international privacy laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig in the aerospace markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our 

products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate further given a significant subset of our employees have transitioned to working from home disaster recovery may take longer to complete 

attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements although we maintain cyber risk insurance damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

risks related to our acquisitions 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2016 through december 31 2020 we have completed 17 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

• our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates 

• the impact of increased competition for acquisitions which may increase acquisition costs affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities 

• successfully integrating acquired businesses including integrating the management technological and operational processes procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations 

• adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us 

• unexpected losses of key employees customers and suppliers of acquired businesses 

• mitigating assumed contingent and unknown liabilities and 

• challenges in managing the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

risks related to our financial condition 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance 

coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2020 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 68486 million or 66 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

environmental matters 

information with respect to environmental matters is set forth in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the company’s historical experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used below are the policies used in preparing the companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions a complete list of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

• business combinations the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company including when applicable the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed estimating fair values requires significant judgments estimates and assumptions including but not limited to discount rates future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names technology and customer relationships these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 

• goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units the 

company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2020 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 40 to 779 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using an appropriate discount rate each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates certain impairment models have discount rates calculated based on a debtequity cost of capital while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded intangible balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2020 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 49779 million or 481 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2020 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

• pensions the company has us and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans the most significant elements in determining the company’s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date at the end of each year the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities in 

estimating this rate for 2020 the company considered rates of return on highquality fixedincome investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan in estimating the us and foreign discount rates the company’s actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans’ projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of longterm bonds at consistent maturity dates the company determines the expected longterm rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans’ investments additionally the company considers historical returns on comparable fixedincome and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate 

• income taxes the process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the company’s tax assets and liabilities to the extent the final outcome differs future adjustments to the company’s tax assets and liabilities may be necessary 

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to 

publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k

and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements a number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2015 through december 31 2019 we have completed 18 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our operational excellence initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industries these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2019 and 2018 represented 480 and 505 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future as of december 31 2019 we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic germany mexico serbia and the united kingdom a disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change 

in the cost to purchase manufacture or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary 

penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with 

that would violate us andor nonus

laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary

penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a disruption in shortage of or price increases for supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing 

price levels in addition our facilities supply chains distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or manmade

disruptions including armed conflict damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees stockholders and others result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses furthermore certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup

which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup

costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup

under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups

as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup

requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products for example we are subject to federal state and international privacy laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig in the aerospace markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements although we maintain cyber risk insurance damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2019 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 68104 million or 69 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash

charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts

as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2019 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 13 nonametekowned

former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned”

sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 12 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in eight of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto

settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde

minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned

sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations

total environmental reserves at december 31 2019 and 2018 were 289 million and 278 million respectively for both nonowned

and owned sites in 2019 the company recorded 70 million in reserves additionally in 2019 the company spent 60 million on environmental matters and the reserve increased

01 million due to foreign currency translation the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2019 and 2018 included reserves of 90 million and 96 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based on presently available information and the company’s historical experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

the company has been remediating groundwater contamination for several contaminants including trichloroethylene “tce” at a formerly owned site in el cajon california several lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging damages resulting from the groundwater contamination including property damages and personal injury and seeking compensatory and punitive damages the company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously the company believes it has established reserves for these lawsuits that are sufficient to satisfy its expected exposure the company does not expect the outcome of these matters either individually or in the aggregate to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the company’s historical experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below its operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides the company’s reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange

plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax

rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2019 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 77 to 1074 for each of the company’s reporting units

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2019 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 47894 million or 487 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

 

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium vanadium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements a number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2014 through december 31 2018 we have completed 21 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our operational excellence initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industries these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2018 and 2017 represented 505 and 515 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states as of december 31 2018 we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic germany mexico serbia and the united kingdom a disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase manufacture or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards maintaining our existing 

 

technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a disruption in shortage of or price increases for supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition our facilities supply chains distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including armed conflict damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees stockholders and others result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses furthermore certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws 

 

while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products for example we are subject to federal state and international privacy laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig in the aerospace markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks may also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure like most multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and 

 

our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements although we maintain cyber risk insurance damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2018 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 60158 million or 69 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

 under asc 606 revenues from certain of the company’s customer contracts meet the criteria of satisfying its performance obligations over time primarily in the areas of the manufacture of custommade equipment and for service repairs of customerowned equipment prior to the adoption of the new standard these revenues were recorded upon shipment or in the case of those sales where title and risk of loss passes at the point of delivery the company recognized revenue upon delivery to the customer recognizing revenue over time for custommanufactured equipment is based on the company’s judgment that in certain contracts the product does not have an alternative use and the company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date this change in revenue recognition accelerated the revenue recognition and costs on the impacted contracts 

 

applying the practical expedient available under asc 606 the company recognizes incremental cost of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the company would have otherwise recognized is one year or less these costs are included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

revenues associated with repairs of customerowned assets were previously recorded upon completion and shipment of the repaired equipment to the customer under asc 606 if the company’s performance enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is enhanced revenue must be recognized over time the revenue associated with the repair of a customerowned asset meets this criterion 

the determination of the revenue to be recognized in a given period for performance obligations satisfied over time is based on the input method the company recognizes revenue over time as it performs on these contracts because the transfer of control to the customer occurs over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the company generally uses the total costtocost input method of progress because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as costs are incurred under the costtocost method the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation on certain contracts labor hours is used as the measure of progress when it is determined to be a better depiction of the transfer of control to the customer due to the timing and pattern of labor hours incurred 

performance obligations also include postdelivery service installation and training postdelivery service revenues are recognized over the contract term installation and training revenues are recognized over the period the service is provided warranty terms in customer contracts can also be considered separate performance obligations if the warranty provides services beyond assurance that a product complies with agreedupon specification or if a warranty can be purchased separately the company does not incur significant obligations for customer returns and refunds accruals for sales returns other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based on the company’s historical experience at december 31 2018 and 2017 the accrual for future warranty obligations was 235 million and 229 million respectively the company’s expense for warranty obligations was 139 million in 2018 and 160 million in both 2017 and 2016 respectively the warranty periods for products sold vary among the company’s operations but generally do not exceed one year the company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses if actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than the company’s historical experience additional accruals may be required 

payment terms generally begin upon shipment of the product the company does have contracts with multiple billing terms that are all due within one year from when the product is delivered no significant financing component exists payment terms are generally 3060 days from the time of shipment or customer acceptance but terms can be shorter or longer for customer contracts that have revenue recognized over time revenue is generally recognized prior to a payment being due from the customer in such cases the company recognizes a contract asset at the time the revenue is recognized when payment becomes due based on the contract terms the company reduces the contract asset and records a receivable in contracts with billing milestones or in other instances with a long production cycle or concerns about credit customer advance payments are received the company may receive a payment in excess of revenue recognized to that date in these circumstances a contract liability is recorded 

the company has certain contracts with variable consideration in the form of volume discounts rebates and early payment options which may affect the transaction price used as the basis for revenue recognition in these contracts the amount of the variable consideration is not considered constrained and is allocated among the various performance obligations in the customer contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation to the total standalone value of all the performance obligations 

 

  

  

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below its operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides the company’s reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the 

 

company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2018 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 29 to 859 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2018 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 42962 million or 496 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2018 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill were not impaired 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

  

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a measurement date of december 31 its fiscal year end for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 which totaled 51 million compared with 548 million in 2017 the company anticipates making approximately 3 million to 6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium vanadium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2013 through december 31 2017 we have completed 18 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our operational excellence initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industries these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2017 and 2016 represented 515 and 524 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states as of december 31 2017 we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic mexico and serbia a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the effective cost of these products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to 

 

incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air 

 

emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig in the aerospace markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and other information technology and business disruptions 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems products and information technology systems may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including cybersecurity attacks other information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security armed conflict as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises for example our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses cyberattacks or other security breach employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunications or utility failures or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning and security upgrade efforts may be ineffective or inadequate a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain our distribution system our products or our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments our relationships and reputation with customers suppliers employees stockholders and others result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2017 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 51290 million or 66 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

although the 916 million net benefit represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the act on the company’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 it should be considered provisional as additional guidance from the us department of treasury is provided the company may need to adjust the provisional amounts after it finalizes the 2017 us tax return and is able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to its us portion of net deferred tax liability of 3904 million as of december 31 2017 as well as to the liability associated with the onetime mandatory tax the currently recorded amounts include a variety of estimates of taxable earnings and profits estimated taxable foreign cash balances differences between us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and us tax principles and interpretations of many aspects of the act that may if changed impact the final amounts any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of provision for income taxes in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 and could result in significant impacts to the effective tax rate for the period the company is still evaluating the potential future impact of the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” section of the act and has not provided any provisional deferred tax liability for it under us gaap the company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in the us taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the company’s measurement of its deferred taxes due to the ongoing evaluation the company has not yet made the accounting policy decision see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

the 2017 effective tax rate reflects 123 million of tax benefits related to sharebased payment transactions in accordance with the january 1 2017 adoption of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting “asu 201609” see notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates tax benefits related to international and state tax planning initiatives and the release of uncertain tax position liabilities relating to certain statute expirations

and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below its operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides the company’s reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2017 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 20 to 670 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2017 goodwill and other indefinitelived 

 

intangible assets totaled 37246 million or 477 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill were not impaired 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a measurement date of december 31 its fiscal year end for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017 which totaled 548 million compared with 68 million in 2016 the company anticipates making approximately 2 million to 6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 

 

  

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers “asu 201409” and modified the standard thereafter the objective of asu 201409 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity recognizes revenue at the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the fasb accounting standards codification 

asu 201409 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and may be early adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the company adopted asu 201409 as of january 1 2018 the guidance permits adoption by retrospectively applying the guidance to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or prospectively applying the guidance and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous guidance with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized in beginning retained earnings at the date of initial application modified retrospective method the company will use the modified retrospective method of adoption 

asu 201409 will impact the company’s revenue recognition procedures by requiring recognition of certain revenues to move from upon shipment or delivery to overtime the recording of certain revenues overtime is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position also the company has developed the additional expanded disclosures required the company has implemented the appropriate changes to its business processes to support recognition and disclosure under asu 201409 the company does not expect the adoption of asu 201409 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory “asu 201511” which applies to inventory that is measured using fifo or average cost as prescribed in this update an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of 

 

completion disposal and transportation subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using lifo the company prospectively adopted asu 201511 effective january 1 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes “asu 201517” asu 201517 simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet the company prospectively adopted asu 201517 effective january 1 2017 therefore prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this adoption the adoption of asu 201517 did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases “asu 201602” the new standard establishes a rightofuse model that requires a lessee to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement asu 201602 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted asu 201602 includes transitional guidance as currently issued that calls for a modified retrospective approach the fasb has recently proposed adding a transition option to the current guidance and it includes optional practical expedients for ease of transition the company has formed a steering committee to lead the company’s implementation project the company has not determined the impact asu 201602 may have on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position cash flows and financial statement disclosures which could be significant to the company’s financial position 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 includes changes to the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the company prospectively adopted asu 201609 effective january 1 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded a tax benefit of 123 million within provision for income taxes related to the tax effects of sharebased payment transactions prior to adoption this amount would have been recorded as a component of capital in excess of par value the adoption of this standard could create volatility in the company’s effective tax rate going forward the company elected not to change its accounting policy with respect to the estimation of forfeitures the company no longer reclassifies the excess tax benefits from sharebased payments from operating activities to financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 the company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of its diluted earnings per share and the related increase in the company’s diluted weighted average common shares outstanding was not significant 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 clarifying the definition of a business “asu 201701” asu 201701 provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business asu 201701 requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets if so the set of assets is not a business asu 201701 requires that to be a business the set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs asu 201701 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 asu 201701 will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption early adoption is permitted including for interim or annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance the company does not expect the adoption of asu 201701 to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position cash flows and financial statement disclosures 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment “asu 201704” asu 201704 eliminates the requirement to calculate the reporting unit fair value of goodwill 

 

second step to measure a goodwill impairment charge under the guidance an impairment charge will be measured based on the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value first step asu 201704 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted the company early adopted asu 201704 effective january 1 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position cash flows and financial statement disclosures 

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201707 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost “asu 201707” which changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension andor other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement asu 201707 requires employers to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs all other components of the net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income asu 201707 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 the changes in presentation will be applied retrospectively when adopted the company expects restated 2017 cost of sales to increase 115 million with an offsetting 115 million increase to other operating income the 2018 service cost included in operating income is expected to approximate 2017 service cost of 71 million the company does not expect the adoption of asu 201707 to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial position cash flows and financial statement disclosures 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201709 scope of modification accounting “asu 201709” asu 201709 clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting asu 201709 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted the company does not expect the adoption of asu 201709 to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

internal reinvestment 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 751 million or 17 of net sales in 2017 compared with 633 million or 16 of net sales in 2016 in 2017 approximately 55 of capital expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to approximate 2 of net sales with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity 

research development and engineering 

the company is committed to and has consistently invested in research development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products and solutions research development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 2212 million in 2017 and 2008 million in both 2016 and 2015 customer reimbursements in 2017 2016 and 2015 were 54 million 72 million and 69 million respectively these amounts included research and development expenses of 1304 million 1120 million and 1163 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and solutions and the improvement of existing products and solutions 

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2017 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 13 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 12 of these sites based on the low 

 

volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in eight of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2017 and 2016 were 301 million and 284 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2017 the company recorded 77 million in reserves and the reserve increased 04 million due to foreign currency translation additionally the company spent 64 million on environmental matters in 2017 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2017 and 2016 included reserves of 116 million and 124 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2017 the company had 120 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 19 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based on presently available information and the company’s historical experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

the company has been remediating groundwater contamination for several contaminants including trichloroethylene “tce” at a formerly owned site in el cajon california several lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging damages resulting from the groundwater contamination including property damages and personal injury and seeking compensatory and punitive damages given the state of uncertainty inherent in these litigations the company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably 

 

possible loss in regard to these matters the company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously the company does not expect the outcome of these matters either individually or in the aggregate to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

competition 

in general most of ametek’s markets are highly competitive with competition based on technology performance quality service and price 

in eig’s markets ametek believes it ranks as a leader in certain analytical measuring and control instruments and in the us heavyvehicle and power and industrial markets it also is a major instrument and sensor supplier to commercial aviation competition is strong and may become intense for certain eig products in process and analytical instruments numerous companies compete in each market on the basis of product quality performance and innovation in power and industrial and aerospace ametek competes with a number of diversified companies depending on the specific market segment 

emg’s differentiated businesses compete with a limited number of companies in each of its markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes 

availability of raw materials

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which would adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2012 through december 31 2016 we have completed 22 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our cost reduction initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

foreign and domestic economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations 

international sales for 2016 and 2015 represented 524 and 517 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic and mexico a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the effective cost of these products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require 

  

us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

  

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisitionrelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements each a “debt facility” and collectively “debt facilities” contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our 

  

ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security armed conflict as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises for example our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunications or utility failures or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain our distribution system or our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments damage customer relationships and our reputation result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2016 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 45530 million or 64 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2016 the company recorded a 139 million noncash impairment charge related to certain of the company’s trade names for further discussion see “critical accounting policies” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the company’s historical experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition 

  

and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below its operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides the company’s reporting units are composed of divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based on the company’s longrange plan and are considered level 3 inputs the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2016 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 32 to 707 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the 

  

qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2016 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 33416 million or 471 of the company’s total assets the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2016 and determined that the carrying values of the company’s goodwill were not impaired the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2016 and determined that the carrying values of certain of the company’s trademarks and trade names with indefinite lives were impaired during 2016 the company recorded a 139 million noncash impairment charge related to certain of the company’s trade names there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

   

all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a measurement date of december 31 its fiscal year end for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2016 which totaled 68 million compared with 552 million in 2015 the company anticipates making approximately 52 million to 56 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017 the estimated cash contributions range includes 501 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in january 2017 with 400 million contributed to us defined benefit pension plans and 101 million contributed to foreign defined benefit pension plans 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2016 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 13 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 12 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in eight of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2016 and 2015 were 284 million and 305 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2016 the company recorded 41 million in reserves additionally the company spent 54 million on environmental matters and the reserve decreased 08 million due to foreign currency translation in 2016 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at 

  

december 31 2016 and 2015 include reserves of 124 million and 115 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2016 the company had 119 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 19 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based on presently available information and the company’s historical experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

  

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense oil and gas process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2011 through december 31 2015 we have completed 22 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our cost reduction initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives including the relocation of manufacturing operations to lowcost locales these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2015 and 2014 represented 517 and 546 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states we have manufacturing operations in 18 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic and mexico a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

  

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials 

  

or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security armed conflict as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises for example our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunications or utility failures or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain our distribution system or our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments damage customer relationships and our reputation result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2015 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 43796 million or 66 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the 

  

net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

   

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below its operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides the company’s reporting units are composed of the divisions one level below its operating segments at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2015 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 20 to 717 for each of the company’s reporting units 

  

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2015 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 32193 million or 483 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2015 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

   

all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2015 which totaled 552 million compared with 57 million in 2014 the company anticipates making approximately 4 million to 7 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2016 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

development and engineering 

the company is committed to and has consistently invested in research development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products research development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 2008 million 2083 million and 1787 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively customer reimbursements in 2015 2014 and 2013 were 69 million 89 million and 92 million respectively these amounts included net companyfunded research and development expenses of 1163 million 1193 million and 939 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2015 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 14 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in nine of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have 

  

been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2015 and 2014 were 305 million and 266 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2015 the company recorded 92 million in reserves of which 84 million was related to a 2015 business acquisition these reserves relate to the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues associated with the acquired business additionally the company spent 51 million on environmental matters in 2015 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2015 and 2014 include reserves of 115 million and 117 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2015 the company had 100 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 19 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

competition 

in general most of ametek’s markets are highly competitive with competition based on technology performance quality service and price 

in eig’s markets ametek believes it ranks as a leader in certain analytical measuring and control instruments and in the us heavyvehicle and power instruments markets it also is a major instrument and sensor supplier to commercial aviation competition is strong and may become intense for certain eig products in process and analytical instruments numerous companies compete in each market on the basis of product quality performance and innovation in aerospace and power instruments ametek competes with a number of diversified companies depending on the specific market segment 

emg’s differentiated businesses compete with a limited number of companies in each of its markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes 

availability of raw materials 

ametek’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than one supplier for emg however certain items including various base metals and certain steel components are available from only a limited number of suppliers ametek believes its sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs 

  

backlog and seasonal variations of business 

ametek’s backlog of unfilled orders by reportable segment was as follows at december 31 

 

 the higher backlog at december 31 2014 was due to the acquired backlog of 2014 acquisitions 

of the total backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2014 approximately 90 is expected to be shipped by december 31 2015 the company believes that neither its business as a whole nor either of its reportable segments is subject to significant seasonal variations although certain individual operations experience some seasonal variability

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a downturn in the us or global economy and in particular in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2010 through december 31 2014 we have completed 26 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not properly execute or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from our cost reduction initiatives 

our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives including the relocation of manufacturing operations to lowcost locales these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient which is necessary in the company’s highly competitive industry these initiatives are often complex and a failure to implement them properly may in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits adversely affect our business and operations 

  

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2014 and 2013 represented 546 and 552 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states we have manufacturing operations in 18 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic and mexico a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 furthermore fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements for example increased strength in the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices in addition our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and we must translate our assets liabilities sales and expenses into us dollars for external reporting purposes as a result changes in the value of the us dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their local currency 

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

  

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology in addition our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices for raw materials parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to among other things supplier’s allocation to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the 

  

costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

  

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems may be impacted by natural or manmade disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security armed conflict as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises for example our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunications or utility failures or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate a shutdown of or inability to utilize one or more of our facilities our supply chain our distribution system or our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly disrupt our operations delay production and shipments damage customer relationships and our reputation result in lost sales result in the misappropriation or corruption of data or result in legal exposure and large repair and replacement expenses 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2014 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 42396 million or 66 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

business overview 

ametek’s operations are affected by global regional and industry economic factors however the company’s strategic geographic and industry diversification and its mix of products and services have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results in 2014 the company established records for orders sales operating income net income diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow contributions from recent acquisitions combined with successful operational excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2014 results the company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under ametek’s four key strategies operational excellence strategic acquisitions global  market expansion and new products highlights of 2014 were

results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 

in 2014 the company established records for orders sales operating income net income diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow the company achieved these results from contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the acquisitions of powervar inc in december 2013 creaform inc in october 2013 and controls southeast “csi” in august 2013 internal sales growth in both eig and emg as well as our operational excellence initiatives the full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of operational excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2015 results while a stronger us dollar is expected to be a headwind in 2015 

net sales for 2014 were 40220 million an increase of 4279 million or 119 compared with net sales of 35941 million in 2013 eig net sales were 24216 million in 2014 an increase of 190 from 20346 million in 2013 emg net sales were 16003 million in 2014 an increase of 26 from 15595 million in 2013 the increase in net sales for 2014 was attributable to higher order rates which drove internal sales growth of approximately 3 and acquisition growth of 9 

total international sales for 2014 were 21962 million or 546 of net sales an increase of 2117 million or 107 compared with international sales of 19845 million or 552 of net sales in 2013 the 2117 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above and higher sales growth and includes the effect of foreign currency translation both reportable segments of the company maintain strong international sales presences in europe and asia export shipments from the united states which are included in total international sales were 11481 million in 2014 an increase of 1111 million or 107 compared with 10370 million in 2013 export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2014 and 2013 acquisitions noted above excluding teseq and creaform 

new orders for 2014 were a record at 40793 million an increase of 4574 million or 126 compared with 36219 million in 2013 the increase in orders for 2014 was due to internal order growth of approximately 4 acquisitions added 10 and foreign currency translation was an unfavorable 1 effect as a result the company’s backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2014 was 11973 million an increase of 573 million or 50 compared with 11400 million at december 31 2013 

segment operating income for 2014 was 9480 million an increase of 865 million or 100 compared with segment operating income of 8615 million in 2013 the increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions and internal sales growth mentioned above as well as the benefits of the company’s operational excellence initiatives partially offset by 189 million in “zygo integration costs” comprised of 104 million in severance charges a 45 million fair value inventory adjustment and 40 million in other charges related to the zygo acquisition segment operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 236 in 2014 compared with 240 in 2013 the decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the zygo integration costs noted above partially offset by the benefits of the company’s operational excellence initiatives

corporate administrative expenses for 2014 were 488 million an increase of 28 million or 61 compared with 460 million in 2013 as a percentage of net sales corporate administrative expenses were 12 for 2014 compared with 13 in 2013

interest expense was 799 million for 2014 an increase of 63 million or 86 compared with 736 million in 2013 the increase was due to the impact of the initial funding of the private placement senior notes in the third quarter of 2014 and higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility to help fund the recent acquisitions 

other expenses net were 138 million for 2014 a decrease of 29 million compared with 167 million in 2013 the decrease was driven by an 80 million insurance policy gain in the fourth quarter of 2014 partially offset by a 55 million reversal of an insurance policy receivable related to a specific uncertain tax position liability of an acquired entity in the third quarter of 2014 

the effective tax rate for 2014 was 274 compared with 287 in 2013 both years’ effective tax rate reflect the improving mix of foreign earnings subject to tax at lower rates and a continued trend in lower state tax rates the 2014 effective tax rate reflects a release of 129 million of uncertain tax position liabilities related to an acquired entity due to the final closure of a tax year and foreign tax credit benefit on amounts repatriated during the year on a comparative basis the 2013 effective tax rate reflected the retroactive extension of the us research and development “rd” tax credit see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details

emg’s net sales totaled 16003 million for 2014 an increase of 408 million or 26 compared with 15595 million in 2013 the net sales increase was attributable to internal sales growth driven by increases in emg’s differentiated businesses

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows 

  

represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below our operating units generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides our reporting units are composed of the divisions one level below our operating units at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2014 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 16 to 600 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the 

  

company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2014 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 31115 million or 485 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2014 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

  

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2014 which totaled 57 million compared with 59 million in 2013 the company anticipates making approximately 54 million to 57 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2015 the estimated cash contributions range includes a 500 million cash contribution to its us defined benefit pension plans in january 2015 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201305 parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity “asu 201305” asu 201305 provides guidance for the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity ceases to hold a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity the company adopted asu 201305 effective january 1 2014 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2014 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 14 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in nine of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2014 and 2013 were 266 million and 219 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2014 the company recorded 83 million in reserves of which 36 million was related to a 2014 business acquisition these reserves relate to the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at sites associated with the acquired business additionally the company spent 36 million on environmental matters in 2014 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2014 and 2013 include reserves of 117 million and 133 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2014 the company had 93 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available 

  

information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the swiss franc exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or power markets could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2009 through december 31 2013 we have completed 24 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2013 and 2012 represented 552 and 512 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states we have manufacturing operations in 15 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic and mexico a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

we have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the 

  

costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations

 other commitments 

the company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of 513 million related to performance and payment guarantees at december 31 2013 based on experience with these arrangements the company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position 

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

   

  

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while 

  

there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2013 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 1 to 555 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2013 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 28643 million or 487 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2013 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

   

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013 which totaled 59 million compared with 43 million in 2012 the company anticipates making approximately 4 million to 7 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2014 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment “asu 201202” the amendments in asu 201202 similar to the amendments of asu no 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in fasb accounting standards codification topic 350 intangibles — goodwill and other  asu 201202 was effective on january 1 2013 for the company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “asu 201302” asu 201302 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts asu 201302 was effective on january 1 2013 for the company see the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the company’s disclosure reflecting these requirements

development and engineering 

the company is committed to research development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products research development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 1787 million 1548 million and 1376 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively customer reimbursements in 2013 2012 and 2011 were 92 million 50 million and 61 million respectively these amounts included net companyfunded research and development expenses of 939 million 849 million and 780 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products 

  

were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2013 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 15 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in nine of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the two remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group or investigating the prp claim and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2013 and 2012 were 219 million and 236 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2013 the company recorded 16 million in reserves additionally the company spent 33 million on environmental matters in 2013 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2013 and 2012 include reserves of 133 million and 147 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2013 the company had 113 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

  

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or power markets could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2008 through december 31 2012 we have completed 27 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2012 and 2011 represented 512 and 502 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states we have manufacturing operations in 16 countries outside the united states with significant operations in china the czech republic and mexico a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

  

a shortage of or price increases for our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

we have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component 

that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims 

  

that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology quality service distribution and price emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit facilities financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2012 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 35180 million or 68 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

total international sales for 2012 were 17076 million or 512 of net sales an increase of 2065 million or 138 compared with international sales of 15011 million or 502 of net sales in 2011 the 2065 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above primarily driven by dunkermotoren and includes the effect of foreign currency translation both reportable segments of the company maintain strong international sales presences in europe and asia despite weakness in the global economy export shipments from the united states which are included in total international sales were 8626 million in 2012 an increase of 877 million or 113 compared with 7749 million in 2011 export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions noted above excluding dunkermotoren and em test 

new orders for 2012 were a record at 35351 million an increase of 4626 million or 151 compared with 30725 million in 2011 the increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2012 and 2011 acquisitions excluding a 1 unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation as a result the company’s backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2012 was a record at 11123 million an increase of 2009 million or 220 compared with 9114 million at december 31 2011

 other commitments 

the company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of 381 million related to performance and payment guarantees at december 31 2012 based on experience with these arrangements the company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position 

  

critical accounting policies 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

   

  

 the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the 2012 results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 53 to 490 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

  

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2012 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 26153 million or 504 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2012 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012 which totaled 43 million compared with 54 million in 2011 the company anticipates making approximately 2 million to 5 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013 

 

   

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss “asu 201104” asu 201104 amendments result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrss” asu 201104 was effective on january 1 2012 for the company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income “asu 201105” asu 201105 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in the twostatement approach the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income for interim periods issuers are only required to provide a total of comprehensive income these amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income the company adopted asu 201105 effective january 1 2012 see the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 testing goodwill for impairment “asu 201108” the amendments in asu 201108 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test described in fasb accounting standards codification topic 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  asu 201108 was effective on january 1 2012 for the company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu no 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment “asu 201202” the amendments in asu 201202 similar to the amendments of asu 201108 permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in fasb accounting standards codification topic 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  asu 201202 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 the company does not expect the adoption of asu 201202 to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

internal reinvestment 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 574 million or 17 of net sales in 2012 compared with 508 million or 17 of net sales in 2011 in 2012 53 of the expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity the company’s 2012 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities the 2013 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 18 of net sales with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity 

development and engineering 

the company is committed to research development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products research development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 1548 million 1376 million and 1121 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively customer reimbursements in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 50 million 61 million and 64 million respectively these amounts included net companyfunded research and development expenses of 849 million 780 million and 568 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2012 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 14 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in nine of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in 

  

certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2012 and 2011 were 236 million and 280 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2012 the company recorded 07 million in reserves additionally the company spent 51 million on environmental matters in 2012 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2012 and 2011 include reserves of 147 million and 175 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2012 the company had 113 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign 

  

currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor markets could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2007 through december 31 2011 we have completed 27 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

  

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2011 and 2010 represented 502 and 490 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain 

  

technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

we have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 66 to 443 for each of the company’s reporting units 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2011 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 21140 million or 489 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets 

  

with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group 

 

 all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 which totaled 54 million compared with 36 million in 2010 the company anticipates making approximately 3 million to 6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012 

 

 the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning 

  

strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

internal reinvestment 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 508 million or 17 of net sales in 2011 compared with 392 million or 16 of net sales in 2010 55 of the expenditures in 2011 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity the company’s 2011 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities the 2012 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 18 of net sales with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity 

development and engineering 

the company is committed to research development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products research development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 1376 million 1121 million and 1014 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively customer reimbursements in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 61 million 64 million and 55 million respectively these amounts included net companyfunded research and development expenses of 780 million 568 million and 505 million respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes 

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2011 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 15 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in ten of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount at the remaining site where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company 

  

is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2011 and 2010 were 280 million and 313 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2011 the company recorded 12 million in reserves additionally the company spent 45 million on environmental matters in 2011 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2011 and 2010 include reserves of 175 million and 189 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2011 the company had 143 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its financial condition and results of operations the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the chinese renminbi the euro the british pound the japanese yen and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor markets could adversely affect our business 

 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor markets could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2006 through december 31 2010 we have completed 27 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with 

our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

 

international sales for 2010 and 2009 represented 490 and 492 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

 12 

 

  

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

 

we have multiple sources of supply for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by 

eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility 

 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit facilities financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2010 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 23352 million or 61 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could record under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

business overview 

 

as a global business ametek’s operations are affected by global regional and industry economic factors however the company’s strategic geographic and industry diversification and its mix of products and services have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results in 2010 the company posted strong sales and established records for operating income operating income margins net income diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow the impact of contributions from recent acquisitions combined with successful operational excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2010 results the company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under ametek’s four growth strategies operational excellence new product development global and market expansion and strategic acquisitions and alliances highlights of 2010 were

results of operations 

 

in 2010 the company posted strong sales and established records for operating income operating income margins net income diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow the company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both eig and emg as well as contributions from acquisitions completed in 2010 and the acquisitions of high standard aviation in january 2009 and ameron global in december 2009 in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company began to experience increased order rates which continued through 2010 the full year impact of the 2010 acquisitions and our operational excellence capabilities should have a positive impact on our 2011 results 

 

net sales for 2010 were 24710 million an increase of 3726 million or 178 when compared with net sales of 20984 million in 2009 net sales for eig were 13241 million in 2010 an increase of 155 from sales of 11466 million in 2009 net sales for emg were 11468 million in 2010 an increase of 205 from sales of 9518 million in 2009 the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to higher order rates as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above the net sales increase for 2010 was driven by strong internal sales growth of approximately 13 with no impact from foreign currency translation the acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase 

 

total international sales for 2010 were 12113 million or 490 of consolidated net sales an increase of 1796 million or 174 when compared with international sales of 10317 million or 492 of consolidated net sales in 2009 the 1796 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth noted above as well as continued expansion into asia and includes the effect of foreign currency translation both reportable segments of the company maintain a strong international sales presence in europe and asia export shipments from the united states which are included in total international sales were 5645 million in 2010 an increase of 1504 million or 363 compared with 4141 million in 2009 export shipments improved due to increased exports from both the base businesses and the acquisitions noted above

critical accounting policies 

 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby 

materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s longrange plan the company’s longrange plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit showed that despite the hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value the fair values of the company’s reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 26 to 406 for each of the company’s reporting units 

 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2010 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 18183 million or 476 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group

all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2010 which totaled 36 million compared with 211 million in 2009 the company anticipates making approximately 30 million to 50 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 

 

  

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense

environmental matters 

 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2010 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 16 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in ten of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount in the two remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligations the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2010 and 2009 were 313 million and 270 million respectively for both nonowned and owned sites in 2010 the company recorded 64 million in reserves related primarily to a 2010 business acquisition these reserves relate to the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at an owned site associated with the acquired business additionally the company spent 21 million on environmental matters in 2010 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2010 and 2009 include reserves of 189 million and 192 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2010 the company had 142 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects however one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 and as a result the company is performing investigation and remediation of a formerly owned site under a stipulation and settlement agreement 

 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information 

and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company 

 

market risk 

 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the chinese renminbi the euro the british pound the japanese yen and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information 

 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

the company’s marketing efforts generally are organized and carried out at the division level eig makes significant use of distributors and sales representatives in marketing its products as well as direct sales in some of its more technically sophisticated products within aerospace its specialized customer base of aircraft and jet engine manufacturers is served primarily by direct sales engineers given the technical nature of many of its products as well as its significant worldwide market share emg conducts much of its domestic and international marketing activities through a direct sales force and makes some use of sales representatives and distributors both in the united states and in other countries 

 

competition 

 

in general most of the company’s markets are highly competitive the principal elements of competition for the company’s products are price product technology distribution quality and service 

 

in the markets served by eig the company believes that it ranks among the leading us producers of certain measuring and control instruments it also is a leader in the us heavyvehicle instrumentation and power instrument markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers to the commercial aviation market competition remains strong and can intensify for certain eig products especially its pressure gauge and heavyvehicle instrumentation products both of these businesses have several strong competitors in the process and analytical instruments market numerous companies in each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation the aerospace and power instrument businesses have a number of diversified competitors which vary depending on the specific market niche 

 

emg’s differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes in its costdriven businesses emg has limited domestic competition in the us floor care market from independent manufacturers competition is increasing from asian motor manufacturers that serve both the us and the european floor care markets increasingly global vacuum motor production is being shifted to asia where ametek has a smaller but growing market position there is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motorblowers many of these manufacturers would also be potential emg customers if they decided to outsource their motor production 

 

backlog and seasonal variations of business 

 

the company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business segment was as follows at december 31 

 

 

 

the lower backlog at december 31 2009 was primarily due to the global economic recession partially offset by the acquisition of high standard aviation and ameron global in 2009 and the positive impact of a weakening us dollar when compared to the british pound and euro 

of the total backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2009 approximately 82 is expected to be shipped by december 31 2010 the company believes that neither its business as a whole nor either of its reportable segments is subject to significant seasonal variations although certain individual operations experience some seasonal variability

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

current economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the global economy has recently undergone a period of unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets as well as a general slowdown in demand including in many of the end markets we serve a prolonged period of economic decline or stagnation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other risk factors we have described below these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways our global business is adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending capital spending air travel industrial production and government procurement any economic slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of our customers to make timely payments in addition the potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased furthermore a disparate impact on or government actions affecting one of the major economies could produce volatility in the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies adversely affecting our results we are unable to predict the timing duration and severity of any further disruptions in financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely affect our business 

 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2005 through december 31 2009 we have completed 24 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

 11 

 

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

 

international sales for 2009 and 2008 represented 49 and 48 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

 

we have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations including with respect to climate change may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur a significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

 

our access to sources of liquidity may be limited by market conditions and restrictions in our revolving credit facility and other agreements 

 

in 2009 the financial markets have experienced a significant liquidity shortfall as a result of diverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies if the availability of funds remains limited we could incur increased costs associated with renewal of our credit facility andor other debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the credit market may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions notwithstanding the foregoing at this time we believe that available shortterm and longterm capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends to our shareholders any contemplated acquisitions and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit facilities financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we 

are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2009 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 17992 million or 55 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies 

 

the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ materially from the estimates used the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company’s accounting policies and to management’s discussion and analysis the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company’s accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed primary disclosure of the company’s significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

the company identifies its reporting units at the component level which is one level below our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting units based upon the reporting unit in which that operating company resides our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 

 

the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair 

value of its reporting units in a sales transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon the company’s long range plan the company’s long range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions the company’s overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test the company applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in fair values of each reporting unit the results expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit from this hypothetical 10 decrease in fair value ranged from an excess of the fair values of the company’s reporting units over their respective carrying values of 22 to 411 for each of the company’s reporting units 

 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

 

the company’s acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2009 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 14474 million or 446 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and determined that the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles were not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future 

 

other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives are considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group

all unrecognized prior service costs remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” in stockholders’ equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost the company uses a december 31 measurement date the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured for its us and foreign defined benefit plans 

 

to fund the plans the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2009 which totaled 211 million compared with 799 million in 2008 the company anticipates making approximately 20 million to 50 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010 

 

  

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets taking into consideration the company’s forecast of future taxable income available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and the amount of valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

 

recently issued financial accounting standards

environmental matters 

 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2009 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 16 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in ten of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount in the two remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligation the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 270 million and 284 million respectively for nonowned and owned sites in 2009 the company received 13 million of additional reserves from a third party for existing sites additionally the company spent 27 million on environmental matters in 2009 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2009 and 2008 include reserves of 192 million and 179 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2009 the company has 139 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for approximately 190 million of additional costs 

 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects however one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 as discussed further in the following paragraph 

 

in august 2009 the company agreed to a stipulation and settlement agreement with the san diego regional water quality control board regarding the 2008 notice of administrative civil liability related to a former 

subsidiary which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 whereby the company paid and deferred minor penalties which were covered by previously establish reserves 

 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company 

 

market risk 

 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information 

 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

competition 

 

in general most of the company’s markets are highly competitive the principal elements of competition for the company’s products are price product technology distribution quality and service 

 

in the markets served by eig the company believes that it ranks among the leading us producers of certain measuring and control instruments it also is a leader in the us heavyvehicle instrumentation and power instrument markets and one of the leading instrument and sensor suppliers to the commercial aviation market competition remains strong and can intensify for certain eig products especially its pressure gauge and heavyvehicle instrumentation products both of these businesses have several strong competitors in the process and analytical instruments market numerous companies in each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation the aerospace and power instrument businesses have a number of diversified competitors which vary depending on the specific market niche 

 

emg’s differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes in its costdriven businesses emg has limited domestic competition in the us floor care market from independent manufacturers competition is increasing from asian motor manufacturers that serve both the us and the european floor care markets increasingly global vacuum motor production is being shifted to asia where ametek has a smaller but growing market position there is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motorblowers many of these manufacturers would also be potential emg customers if they decided to outsource their motor production 

 

backlog and seasonal variations of business 

 

the company’s backlog of unfilled orders by business segment was as follows at december 31 

 

 

 

the higher backlog at december 31 2008 was primarily due to the six businesses acquired in 2008 partially offset by the negative impact of a strengthening us dollar when compared to the british pound and euro 

 

of the total backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2008 approximately 84 is expected to be shipped by december 31 2009 the company believes that neither its business as a whole nor either of its reportable segments is subject to significant seasonal variations although certain individual operations experience some seasonal variability 

 

availability of raw materials 

 

the company’s reportable segments obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than one supplier however for emg certain items including various base metals and certain steel 

components are available only from a limited number of suppliers the company believes its sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for its needs

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

current economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility and distress in financial markets as well as a general slowdown in demand including in many of the end markets we serve a prolonged 

period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other risk factors we have described below these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways our global business is adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending capital spending air travel industrial production and government procurement any economic slowdown results in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and negatively impacts the ability of our customers to make timely payments in addition the potential for one or more of our customers or suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy is increased furthermore a disparate impact on or government actions affecting one of the major economies could produce volatility in the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies adversely affecting our results we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely affect our business 

 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2004 through december 31 2008 we have completed 23 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

  

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

 

international sales for 2008 and 2007 represented 48 and 49 of our consolidated net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

 

we have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us we cannot predict the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for instance an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

 

our access to sources of liquidity may be limited by market conditions and restrictions in our revolving credit facility and other agreements 

 

in recent months the financial markets have experienced a significant liquidity shortfall as a result of diverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies if the availability of funds remains limited we could incur increased costs associated with our receivables securitization facility any renewal of our credit facility andor other debt instruments in addition it is possible that our ability to access the credit market may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt andor react to changing economic and business conditions notwithstanding the foregoing at this time we believe that available shortterm and longterm capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends to our shareholders any contemplated acquisitions and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit facilities financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2008 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 16818 million or 55 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there 

has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

effective january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in accordance with fin 48 the company is required to assess the uncertainty in its tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements once the minimum threshold is met using a more likely than not standard a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50 likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes published guidance external expert opinion or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy legislation and audit practice 

 

as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” the company recorded a 47 million increase in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 24 million a decrease of 12 million in goodwill related to a previous business combination and a 59 million charge to the january 1 2007 opening balance of retained earnings the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

 

recently issued financial accounting standards 

 

effective january 1 2008 the company adopted sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157  which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas 157 for fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at least annually the deferral applies to fair value in goodwill impairment testing indefinitelived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment testing asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination therefore the company has adopted the provisions of sfas 157 with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under sfas 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 

 

sfas 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroboration for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value a financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 

 

at december 31 2008 03 million of the company’s cash and cash equivalents and 42 million of marketable securities are valued as level 1 investments the company held 85 million valued as level 2 investments in the investments and other assets line of the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2008 gains and losses on the investments noted above were not material 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations “sfas 141r” this statement significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions in the company’s consolidated financial statements sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and prohibits early adoption upon adoption sfas 141r will not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however depending on the nature of an acquisition or the quantity of acquisitions entered into after the adoption sfas 141r may significantly impact the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows when compared to acquisitions accounted for under existing us gaap and result in more earnings volatility and generally lower earnings due to among other items the expensing of deal costs and restructuring costs of acquired companies 

 

in november 2008 the fasb ratified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 087 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf 087 eitf 087 clarifies how to account for acquired defensive intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement under sfas 141r that the company does not intend to actively use but does intend to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset eitf 087 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 along with sfas 141r the company has evaluated eitf 087 and does not expect the adoption of eitf 087 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 “sfas 160” sfas 160 significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling minority interests in the company’s consolidated financial statements sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and prohibits early adoption the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 160 to have an impact on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1423 determination of the useful life of intangible assets “fsp fas 1423” fsp fas 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 fsp fas 1423 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas 141r and other us gaap fsp fas 1423 applies to all intangible assets and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years the company has evaluated fsp fas 1423 and does not expect the adoption of fsp fas 1423 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

product development and engineering 

 

the company is committed to research product development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products research product development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were 1159 million 1029 million and 876 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively customer reimbursements in 2008 2007 and 2006 were 61 million 71 million and 64 million respectively these amounts included net companyfunded research and development expenses of 575 million 529 million and 420 million respectively all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes 

 

environmental matters 

 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2008 the company is named a potentially responsible party “prp” at 16 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the “nonowned” sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 14 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in 10 of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the tentatively agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other four sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount in the two remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligation the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the 

amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements in estimating the company’s liability for remediation the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 284 million and 253 million respectively for nonowned and owned sites in 2008 the company provided 73 million of additional reserves including 56 million for existing sites and 17 million related to recent acquisitions additionally the company spent 42 million on environmental matters in 2008 the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2008 and 2007 include reserves of 179 million and 180 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2008 the company has 124 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation also the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for up to 190 million of additional costs 

 

the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects however one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 as discussed further in the following paragraph 

 

in october 2008 the company received a notice of administrative civil liability from the san diego regional water quality control board seeking certain penalties the notice claims that a former subsidiary of ametek which became a separate company in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007 failed to adequately produce a delineation report and feasibility study within specified time frames we believe we have good and valid defenses to this claim and intend to vigorously defend against it 

 

the company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company 

 

market risk 

 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel aluminum copper steel titanium and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the company’s best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information 

 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 “pslra” which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a risk factors the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions 

 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2004 we have completed 17 acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

 11 

   

  

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in production inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

 

international sales for 2007 and 2006 represented approximately 49 and 48 of our total net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

 12 

   

our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws 

 

we are required to comply with various import export export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item in addition failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties disruptions to our business limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation 

 

any inability to hire train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully 

 

if we cannot hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

 

we have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle 

  and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us we cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our business or operations 

 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for example an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely affect our business 

 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2007 goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 1358 million or about 49 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

  company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount in the three remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligation the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonowned sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations the “owned” sites for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the financial statements in estimating our liability for remediation we also consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations 

 

total environmental reserves at december 31 2007 and 2006 were 253 million and 287 million respectively for nonowned and owned sites in 2007 the company provided 15 million of additional reserves for environmental liabilities the company’s reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31 2007 and 2006 include reserves of 180 million and 212 million respectively for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of hcc industries “hcc” the company is solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities at december 31 2007 the company has 126 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from thirdparty escrow funds and other committed thirdparty funds to support the required remediation in addition the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for up to 190 million of additional costs 

 

the company also has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date these parties have met their obligations in all material respects however one of these companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation ametek has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company 

 

market risk 

 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities the company’s differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole 

 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 

 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen the chinese renminbi and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate 

  fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel copper steel and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates our best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information 

 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of 1995 which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1arisk factors we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

leading instrument and sensor suppliers to the commercial aviation market competition remains strong and can intensify for certain eig products especially its pressure gauge and heavyvehicle instrumentation products both of these businesses have several strong competitors in the process and analytical instruments market numerous companies in each specialized market compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation the aerospace and power instrument businesses have a number of diversified competitors which vary depending on the specific market niche 

emg’s differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes in its costdriven businesses emg has limited domestic competition in the us floor care market from independent manufacturers competition is increasing from asian motor manufacturers that serve both the us and the european floor care markets increasingly global vacuum motor production is being shifted to asia where ametek has a growing but smaller market position there is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motorblowers many of these manufacturers would also be potential emg customers if they decided to outsource their motor production 

backlog and seasonal variations of business 

the company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by business segment at the dates specified below was as follows 

 

the higher backlog at december 31 2006 was primarily due to the five businesses acquired in 2006 as well as increased order rates primarily in the company’s differentiated businesses

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or finance future acquisitions 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2003 we have completed thirteen acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or product line transfers 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities or completing product line transfers as well as possible underutilization of our existing facilities could result in product inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

international sales for 2006 and 2005 represented approximately 48 and 46 of our total net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will continue to increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

a shortage of or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

we have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether 

the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations new classification of hazardous materials stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us we cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our business or operations 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of for example an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive industries which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely affect our business 

several of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements contain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2006 goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 1081 million or about 51 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired at a minimum we assess annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

  results of operations 

in 2006 the company posted record sales operating income net income diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations the company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both its eig and emg groups as well as contributions from acquisitions in 2006 and 2005 operating income increased driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our operational excellence initiatives based on current market conditions the company expects continued strength in most of its businesses in 2007

total international sales for 2006 increased to 8660 million and represented 476 of consolidated sales an increase of 2101 million or 320 when compared with international sales of 6559 million or 457 of consolidated sales in 2005 the increase in international sales resulted from the recent acquisitions of spectro solartron and hcc in 2005 and the land instruments acquisition in 2006 as well as increased international sales from base businesses increased international sales came mainly from sales to asia and europe by both group’s export shipments from the united states which are included in total international sales were 3438 million in 2006 an increase of 765 million or 286 compared with 2673 million in 2005 export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from base businesses 

new orders for 2006 were 19154 million compared with 15343 million for 2005 an increase of 3811 million or 248 the increase in orders was driven by demand in the company’s differentiated businesses led by the company’s process businesses as well as the recent acquisitions mentioned above the order backlog at december 31 2006 was 5368 million compared with 4407 million at december 31 2005 an increase of 961 million or 218 the increase in backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated businesses as well as the 2006 acquisitions

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 2195 million in 2006 compared with 1742 million in 2005 an increase of 452 million or 260 however as a percentage of sales sga expenses in 2006 were flat with 2005 at 121 of sales selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 102 in 2006 essentially unchanged from 2005 most of the increase in selling expenses was due to the acquired businesses the company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses base business selling expenses increased 49 which is significantly lower than the company’s 9 internal sales growth rate for 2006 

corporate administrative expenses were 342 million in 2006 an increase of 45 million or 153 when compared with 2005 the increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher compensation costs including equitybased compensation as a percentage of sales corporate administrative expenses were 19 in 2006 a decline from 21 of sales in 2005 

consolidated operating income was 3090 million in 2006 an increase of 755 million or 323 when compared with 2335 million in 2005 this represents an operating margin of 170 of sales for 2006 compared with 163 of sales in 2005 

interest expense was 422 million in 2006 an increase of 281 compared with 329 million in 2005 the increase was due to higher average borrowings necessary to fund the 2005 and 2006 acquisitions primarily related to the euro longterm debt incurred for the 2005 acquisition of spectro and shortterm debt incurred for the late 2005 acquisition of hcc 

the effective tax rate for 2006 was 310 compared with 312 in 2005 the 2006 effective tax rate benefited primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards of 32 million offset somewhat by higher nondeductible equitybased compensation the 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates benefited from the realization of tax benefits stemming from the company’s worldwide tax planning activities and other adjustments

eig’s operating income for 2006 increased to 2034 million from 1642 million in 2005 an increase of 392 million or 239 the increase in operating income was driven by the higher sales which includes the acquisitions operating margins of eig were 200 of sales for 2006 compared with operating margins of 203 of sales in 2005 the decrease in operating margins was due to the inclusion of a 43 million gain from the sale of a facility in 2005 

  emg’s sales for 2006 were 8028 million an increase of 1768 million or 282 compared with sales of 6260 million in 2005 the sales increase was due in part to internal growth particularly in emg’s differentiated businesses which accounted for approximately 9 of the 282 sales increase the acquisitions of hcc in october 2005 and pittman in may 2006 accounted for the remainder of the sales increase the foreign currency translation effect on sales for 2006 was nominal 

emg’s operating income for 2006 increased to 1399 million from 992 million in 2005 an increase of 407 million or 410 the operating income increase was significantly due to higher sales from the group’s differentiated businesses which includes the recent acquisitions mentioned above emg’s operating margins were 174 of sales in 2006 compared with operating margins of 159 of sales in 2005 the increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher profit yield on the sales contribution of emg’s differentiated businesses

  emg’s sales for 2005 were 6260 million an increase of 611 million or 108 compared with sales of 5649 million in 2004 the sales increase was due in part to internal growth particularly in the group’s differentiated businesses which accounted for 42 of the 108 sales increase the acquisitions of hughestreitler in 2004 and hcc in october 2005 as well as 23 million of favorable foreign currency translation effects accounted for the remainder of the sales increase 

emg’s operating income for 2005 increased to 992 million from 933 million in 2004 an increase of 59 million or 63 emg’s increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales from its differentiated businesses which included the 2005 acquisitions mentioned above operating margins of emg were 159 of sales in 2005 compared with operating margins of 165 of sales in 2004 the decrease in operating margin was the result of unfavorable changes in product mix within the group’s costdriven motor businesses

environmental matters 

certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time at december 31 2006 the company is named a potentially responsible party prp at 16 nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the company is identified as a “de minimis” party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps in 11 of these sites the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements the agreedto settlement amounts are fully reserved in the other two sites the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement 

amount in the three remaining sites where the company is a nonde minimis prp the company is participating in the investigation andor related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company’s expected obligation the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue in addition to these nonametekowned former waste disposal or treatment sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation risk assessment feasibility study and corrective action processes in certain instances the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the lowend of the range it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the financial statements however the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the financial statements in estimating our liability for remediation we also consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations total environmental reserves at december 31 2006 and 2005 were 287 million and 68 million respectively in 2006 the company provided 230 million of additional reserves including 08 million for existing sites and 222 million related to the recent acquisitions of hcc 212 million and land instruments 10 million the additional reserves related to the recent acquisitions were recorded through purchase accounting and did not affect the company’s income statement the company spent 11 million and 10 million respectively on such environmental matters in 2006 and 2005 the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses including hcc as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances in the case of hcc the company has assumed the liability for the performance of all required remedial activities at the site and has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs for the required remedial activities the company has recorded a total of 158 million of receivables in its balance sheet related to the hcc matter for probable recoveries from third party escrow funds and other committed third party funds to support the required remediation as well as a deferred tax benefit of 28 million in addition the company is indemnified by hcc’s former owners for up to 190 million of additional costs the company and some of the other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date those parties have met their obligations in all material respects the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company 

market risk 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its shortterm and longterm debt foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw material purchases 

the company’s shortterm debt carries variable interest rates and generally its longterm debt carries fixed rates these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro the british pound the japanese yen chinese renminbi and the mexican peso exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and the occasional use of derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel copper steel and gold exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates our best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

forwardlooking information 

certain matters discussed in this form 10k are “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of 1995 which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties many such factors will be important in determining the company’s actual future results the company wishes to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused and in the future could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1arisk factors we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information subsequent events or otherwise unless required by the securities laws to do so

emg’s differentiated businesses have competition from a limited number of companies in each of their markets competition is generally based on product innovation performance and price there also is competition from alternative materials and processes in its costdriven businesses emg has limited domestic competition in the us floor care market from independent manufacturers competition is increasing from asian motor manufacturers that serve both the us and the european floor care markets increasingly global vacuum motor production is being shifted to asia where ametek has a weaker market position there is potential competition from vertically integrated manufacturers of floor care products that produce their own motorblowers many of these manufacturers would also be potential emg customers if they decided to outsource their motor production 

 

backlog and seasonal variations of business 

 

the company’s approximate backlog of unfilled orders by business segment at the dates specified below was as follows 

 

 

 

the higher backlog at december 31 2005 was primarily due to the three businesses acquired in 2005 as well as increased order rates primarily in the company’s differentiated businesses 

 

of the total backlog of unfilled orders at december 31 2005 approximately 89 is expected to be shipped by december 31 2006 the company believes that neither its business as a whole nor either of its operating segments is subject to significant seasonal variations although certain individual operations experience some seasonal variability

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or to finance future acquisitions 

 

a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses since the beginning of 2002 we have completed nine acquisitions we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings although we have been successful with our acquisition strategies in the past our ability to effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors including 

 

 10 

 

  

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may experience unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities 

 

certain of our businesses are relocating or have recently relocated manufacturing operations to lowcost locales unanticipated startup expenses and production delays in opening new facilities as well as possible underutilizations of our existing facilities could result in product inefficiencies which would adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our substantial international sales and operations are subject to customary risks associated with international operations 

 

international sales for 2005 and 2004 represented approximately 46 and 44 of our total net sales respectively as a result of our growth strategy we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will continue to increase in the future international operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment including 

 

  

if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis it could adversely affect our business and prospects 

 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to develop on a timely basis technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining such advantages will require us to continue 

investing in research and development and sales and marketing there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products 

 

a shortage or price increases in our raw materials could increase our operating costs 

 

we have multiple sources of supplies for our major raw material requirements and we are not dependent on any one supplier however certain items including base metals and certain steel components are available only from a limited number of suppliers shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge our operating costs and our competitive position which could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance cleanup which may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

our business operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things air emissions discharges to waters and the use manufacturing generation handling storage transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials in addition the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup costs without regard to fault on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for cleanup under the act we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites which are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use manufacture store handle and dispose of various hazardous materials we may incur substantial costs for investigation removal remediation and capital expenditures in connection with compliance with environmental laws while it is not possible to quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters based on our experience to date we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities 

 

we are subject to numerous governmental regulations which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs 

 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign governmental laws and regulations in addition existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us we cannot predict the impact any of these will have on our business or operations 

 

we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products 

 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property for example our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that has been designed manufactured or serviced by us we may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us 

are successful while we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future claims we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise additionally we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which thirdparty indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business 

 

our markets are highly competitive we compete domestically and internationally with individual producers as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers some of which have resources greater than we do the principal elements of competition for our products are price product technology distribution quality and service emg’s competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes in the markets served by eig although we believe eig is a market leader competition is strong and could intensify in the pressure gauge aerospace and heavyvehicle markets served by eig a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality performance and innovation our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors 

 

a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense heavyvehicle process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could adversely affect our business 

 

several of the industries in which we operate may be cyclical in nature and may be affected by factors beyond our control a prolonged downturn in the aerospace and defense heavyvehicle process instrumentation or electric motor businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

 

our existing revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions or restrict our financial flexibility 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount on our balance sheet and writeoff of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2005 goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 900 million or about 50 of our total assets the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible assets we have acquired at a minimum annually we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels we could be required to record a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment under current applicable accounting rules any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

year ended december 31 2005 compared with year ended december 31 2004 

 

results of operations 

 

in 2005 the company posted record sales operating income net income and diluted earnings per share the company achieved these results from acquisitions internal growth in both its eig and emg groups and cost reduction programs the company experienced improved market conditions in most of its businesses in 2005 

 

the company reported sales for 2005 of 14345 million an increase of 2021 million or 164 from sales of 12323 million in 2004 net sales for eig were 8085 million in 2005 an increase of 211 from sales of 6674 million in 2004 eig’s internal sales growth was 46 in 2005 driven by strength in its highend analytical instruments business and the aerospace and power businesses the acquisitions of spectro in june 2005 solartron in september 2005 and taylor hobson in june 2004 also contributed to the sales growth net sales for emg were 6260 million in 2005 an increase of 108 from sales of 5649 million in 2004 emg’s internal sales growth was 42 in 2005 driven by the group’s differentiated businesses partially offset by flat market conditions within the group’s costdriven businesses the acquisitions of hcc in october 2005 and hughestreitler in july 2004 also contributed to the sales increase 

 

total international sales for 2005 increased to 6559 million or 457 of consolidated sales an increase of 1193 million or 222 when compared with international sales of 5366 million or 435 of consolidated sales 

in 2004 the increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions previously mentioned as well as increased international sales from base businesses increased international sales came mainly from sales to europe and asia by both operating groups export shipments from the united states which are included in total international sales were 2673 million in 2005 an increase of 152 compared with 2320 million in 2004 

 

new orders for 2005 were 15343 million compared with 12870 million for 2004 an increase of 2473 million or 192 most of the increase in orders was driven by demand in the company’s differentiated businesses led by the company’s aerospace and process businesses as well as the 2005 acquisitions mentioned above the order backlog at december 31 2005 was 4407 million compared with 3409 million at december 31 2004 an increase of 998 million or 293 the increase in backlog was due mainly to the 2005 acquisitions backlog increases were also reported by many of the company’s base differentiated businesses 

 

segment operating income was 2668 million for 2005 an increase of 462 million or 209 compared with segment operating income of 2206 million for 2004 segment operating margins in 2005 were 186 of sales an increase from 179 of sales in 2004 the increase in segment operating income was due to higher sales from the company’s differentiated businesses approximately half of the increase in operating income was from the recent acquisitions the margin improvement came entirely from the company’s base differentiated businesses 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 1716 million in 2005 compared with 1355 million in 2004 an increase of 361 million or 266 as a percentage of sales sga expenses were 120 in 2005 compared with 110 in 2004 selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 101 in 2005 compared with 91 in 2004 the selling expense increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions the company’s acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher rate of selling expenses base business selling expenses increased 50 which approximates internal sales growth for 2005 

 

corporate administrative expenses were 274 million in 2005 an increase of 30 million or 123 when compared with 2004 the increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher restricted stock amortization expense related to the company’s 2004 change in its longterm incentive compensation program and higher personnel costs necessary to grow the company the company expects administrative expenses to increase in 2006 due to expected continued growth in the business as a percentage of sales corporate administrative expenses were 19 in 2005 which is slightly lower than in 2004 

 

after deducting corporate administrative expenses consolidated operating income was 2394 million in 2005 an increase of 432 million or 220 when compared with 1962 million in 2004 this represents an operating margin of 167 of sales for 2005 compared with 159 of sales in 2004 

 

interest expense was 329 million in 2005 an increase of 161 compared with 283 million in 2004 the increase was due to higher average borrowing levels to fund the 2005 acquisitions and higher average interest rates 

 

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 311 compared with 320 in 2004 the reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits stemming from the company’s worldwide tax planning activities and other adjustments 

 

net income for 2005 was 1406 million an increase of 279 million or 248 from 1127 million in 2004 diluted earnings per share rose 221 to 199 per share an increase of 036 when compared with 163 per diluted share in 2004 

 

operating segment results 

 

eig’s sales were 8085 million in 2005 an increase of 1411 or 211 from 2004 sales of 6674 million the sales increase was due to internal growth in eig’s aerospace process and analytical instruments and industrial markets and the acquisitions of taylor hobson in 2004 and spectro and solartron in 2005 internal growth accounted for 46 of the 211 increase the acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the sales increase 

 

eig’s operating income for 2005 increased to 1664 million from 1264 million in 2004 an increase of 400 million or 317 the increase in operating income was due to higher sales approximately half of the

sfas 142 requires a twostep impairment test for goodwill the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the company’s reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill the company would be required to record such impairment losses the determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued changes in interest rates and market conditions among other factors may have an impact on these estimates the company’s acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions at december 31 2005 goodwill totaled 7852 million or 441 of the company’s total assets the company performed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 and determined that the company’s goodwill was not impaired there can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future 

 

  

us defined benefit plans

amortization over the estimated service periods of the participants the unrecognized pension loss totaled 775 million for us defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2005 compared with 672 million at december 31 2004 depending on the impact of potential future changes in actuarial assumptions the deferred loss could possibly affect future pension expense under current accounting rules

market risk 

 

the company’s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its shortterm and longterm debt foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw material purchases 

 

most of the company’s longterm debt carries fixed rates and its shortterm debt is variablerate debt these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 

 

the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure include the euro the british pound the mexican peso and the japanese yen exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings and the occasional use of derivative financial instruments the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into us dollars is included in 

other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and the manufacturing and selling costs associated with those revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies 

 

the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel copper and steel exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

 

based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 

 

forwardlooking information

  the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel copper and steel exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures 

  based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates the potential losses in future earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis

2003 of 10916 million an increase of 511 million or 49 from sales of 10405 million in 2002 strengthening foreign currencies contributed 239 million to the sales increase the economic slowdown affecting the manufacturing sector impacted many of the company’s businesses net sales for the electronic instruments group eig were 5619 million in 2003 an increase of 42 from sales of 5394 million in 2002 the 2003 sales increase for eig was due mainly to the first quarter 2003 acquisition of solidstate controls inc sci and the third quarter 2003 acquisition of chandler instruments company llc chandler as well as strength in the highend analytical instruments business partially offset by continued weakness in the aerospace and power businesses net sales for the electromechanical group emg were 5297 million in 2003 an increase of 57 from sales of 5011 million in 2002 primarily driven by the first quarter 2003 acquisition of airtechnology holdings limited airtechnology the emg sales increase was partially offset by a decline in sales within the group’s floor care and specialty motors businesses   total international sales were 4357 million in 2003 and represented 399 of consolidated net sales compared with 3534 million or 340 of sales in 2002 international sales increased 233 in 2003 primarily due to the 2003 acquisitions export shipments from the united states in

backlog at december 31 2003 was 2862 million compared with 2409 million at december 31 2002 an increase of 453 million or 188 the increase in orders and backlog was due mainly to the three acquisitions completed in 2003 the company experienced order declines in its floor care and specialty motors businesses   segment operating income was 1791 million for 2003 an increase of 68 compared with segment operating income of 1677 million for 2002 segment operating margins in 2003 were 164 of sales an increase from 161 of sales in 2002 the increase in segment operating income resulted from the profit contributions generated by the 2003 acquisitions as well as the company’s successful operational excellence strategy this strategy includes the continued migration of production to lowcost locales in mexico china and czech republic and the aggressive lowering of the company’s overall cost structure partially offsetting the increase in segment operating income was the impact of lower sales by the company’s aerospace power instruments floor care and specialty motors businesses an 114 million increase in pension costs general business insurance and employee benefit costs net of benefits from certain insurance programs in 2003 also lowered segment operating income the company expects lower pension expense in 2004 due primarily to the favorable performance of the pension plan investments the estimated decrease in pension expense is expected to be substantially offset by higher employeerelated expenses in 2004   selling general and administrative sga expenses were 1152 million in 2003 compared with 1048 million in 2002 an increase of 104 million or 99 as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 106 in 2003 compared to 101 in 2002 the selling expense component as a percentage of sales increased to 85 in 2003 compared to 83 in 2002 lower selling expenses of the company’s base businesses were more than offset by selling expense of the businesses acquired in 2003 the businesses acquired in 2003 were differentiated businesses which because of their technology and higher marketing costs incur a higher percentage of selling expenses than the company’s base businesses the decrease in selling expense by base businesses reflects the company’s continual focus on cost reduction initiatives as a part of its operational excellence strategy 17     corporate administrative expenses were 224 million or 20 of sales in 2003 an increase of 33 million or 176 when compared with 2002 the increase was primarily the result of a onetime noncash expense in the third quarter of 2003 from the accelerated cost recognition due to the vesting of a restricted stock grant higher net business insurance and health insurance costs as well as higher pension costs in 2003 also contributed to the increase   consolidated operating income totaled 1568 million or 144 of sales for 2003 compared to 1487 million or 143 of sales for 2002 an increase of 81 million or 54   interest expense was 260 million in 2003 an increase of 33 compared with 252 million in 2002 the increase was due to higher average debt levels to fund the 2003 acquisitions partially offset by lower interest rates   the effective tax rate for 2003 was 325 compared with 319 in 2002 the higher tax rate in 2003 was primarily due to the nondeductibility of the expense recognized in connection with the vesting of the restricted stock grant mentioned above   net income for 2003 was 878 million an increase of 49 from 837 million in 2002 diluted earnings per share on a poststock split basis were

of 5394 million the sales increase was primarily from the 2003 sci and chandler acquisitions as well as strength in the group’s highend analytical businesses a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 68 million also benefited the sales of this group conditions continue to remain weak in many of eig’s markets especially in the aerospace and power instruments markets eig’s base business sales were 47 lower including the favorable foreign currency impacts when compared with 2002   eig’s operating income for 2003 increased to 950 million from 875 million in 2002 an increase of 75 million or 86 the increase was primarily driven by the sci and chandler acquisitions partially offset by a net increase of 81 million in pension costs and insurance expenses as well as lower aerospace and power instruments operating income due to their lower sales the group’s operating margins for 2003 improved to 169 compared with margins of 162 for 2002 the higher margins in 2003 were due to the acquired businesses and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives   in september 2003 the group’s haveg business unit experienced a flood at its manufacturing facility in wilmington delaware the company believes the flood loss is fully insured and it does not expect to incur a loss upon the ultimate settlement of the flood claim the company is currently meeting with its insurance carriers to finalize the flood claim and it expects to finalize this matter in 2004   electromechanical group emg sales for 2003 were 5297 million an increase of 286 million or 57 compared with sales of 5011 million in 2002 the sales increase was a result of the airtechnology acquisition and 171 million of favorable foreign currency translation gains partially offset by a decline in the floor care and specialty motors businesses emg’s sales by base businesses were 35 lower including the favorable foreign currency impacts when compared with 2002   emg’s operating income for 2003 increased to 842 million from 802 million in 2002 an increase of 40 million or 49 the increase was a result of the airtechnology acquisition partially offset by lower sales by the group’s base businesses and higher

   the company reported sales in 2002 of 10405 million an increase of 21 from sales of 10193 million in 2001 despite the difficult global economic environment which continued to impact many of the company’s businesses net sales for eig were 5394 million in 2002 an increase of 80 from sales of 4995 million in 2001 the sales increase for eig was due mainly to the 2001 acquisitions of instruments for research and applied science iras and edax inc as well as strength in the company’s heavyvehicle instruments business these increases were partially offset by a continued decline in demand from most of the group’s other businesses primarily aerospace and power instruments net sales for emg were 5011 million in 2002 a decrease of 36 from sales of 5198 million in 2001 due to continued weakness in the united states and european floor care markets partially offset by the 2001 acquisition of gs electric and currency translation gains from international businesses without the impact of the 2001 acquisitions consolidated sales for 2002 would have been lower by 63 when compared with 2001 total consolidated international sales were 3534 million in 2002 an increase of 100 from sales of 3212 million in 2001 export shipments from the united states in 2002 were 1920 million an increase of 129 compared with 1700 million in 2001   new orders in 2002 were 10048 million compared to 10395 million in 2001 a decrease of 347 million or 33 due to an orders decline primarily in the aerospace and power instrument businesses resulting from softness in these markets as well as the overall economic slowdown the decline in orders was partially offset by orders from the 2001 acquisitions the order backlog at december 31 2002 was 2409 million compared with 2766 million at december 31 2001 a decrease of 357 million or 129 due to the decline in aerospace power instrument and technical motor businesses   total segment operating income increased to 1677 million in 2002 an increase of 314 compared with segment operating income of 1277 million in 2001 segment operating margins in 2002 were 161 of sales an increase from 125 of sales in 2001 the higher operating income was primarily driven by the 2001 acquisitions and the nonamortization of goodwill effective at the beginning of 2002 this increase was reduced somewhat by higher net pension costs resulting primarily from lower pension income from the company’s us defined benefit pension plans in 2002 the company continued to benefit from its aggressive cost reduction initiatives which began in the second half of 2000 these initiatives included the continued migration of production to lowcost locales in mexico china and czech republic and the lowering of its overall cost structure segment operating income in 2001 included a fourthquarter pretax charge to operations of 23 million 15 million after tax for cash realignment initiatives and asset writedowns   selling general and administrative sga expenses were 1048 million in 2002 compared with 987 million in 2001 an increase of 61 million or 62 as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 101 in 2002 compared to 97 in 2001 the selling expense component as a percentage of sales increased to 83 in 2002 compared to 79 in 2001 the higher selling expense in 2002 was due to the 2001 acquisitions in eig which had a different overall cost structure than ametek’s base businesses selling expense of base businesses decreased as a percentage of sales during 2002 reflecting the company’s continual focus on cost reduction initiatives   corporate expenses were 190 million or 18 of sales in 2002 an increase of 09 million or 50 when compared to 181 million in 2001 but were unchanged as a percentage of sales higher insurance expense pension costs and professional fees in 2002 accounted for the increase in corporate expenses in 2002   after deducting corporate expenses consolidated operating income was 1487 million or 143 of sales an increase of 391 million when compared with 2001 operating income of 1096 million or 107 of sales   interest expense was 252 million in 2002 a decrease of 98 compared with 279 million in 2001 lower average interest rates were the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense other expenses were 06 million in 2002 compared with other income of 27 million in 2001 the 33 million change resulted primarily from lower investment income from the company’s captive insurance subsidiary in 2002 the year 2001 also included interest income related to tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001 19     the effective tax rate in 2002 was 319 compared with 216 in 2001 the effective tax rate in 2002 was favorably impacted by the effect of not amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of sfas no 142 and the company’s tax planning initiatives the lower tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to the recognition of 105 million in tax benefits resulting from the closure of a number of open tax years by us federal and state tax authorities   net income in 2002 was 837 million or 124 per diluted share on a poststock split basis compared with net income in 2001 of 661 million or 099 per diluted share a 266 increase in net income net income in 2001 included goodwill amortization of 102 million after tax and the net effect of the unusual items previously mentioned 

 

   electronic instruments group eig sales were 5394 million in 2002 an increase of 80 from 2001 sales of 4995 million the sales increase was primarily from the iras and edax acquisitions as well as strength in the heavyvehicle business the company believes the increase in heavyvehicle instrument sales was due mainly to truck purchases in advance of more stringent federal emission standards that became effective october 1 2002 and was considered to be an isolated event conditions remained weak in most of eig’s markets especially in the aerospace power instruments and heavyvehicle markets without the acquisitions eig’s sales would have decreased by 55 when compared with 2001   eig’s operating income in 2002 increased to 875 million from 570 million in 2001 an increase of 305 million or 534 the increase was the result of unusual charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulting from headcount reductions shifting production to lowcost locales and other expense reduction initiatives eig also benefited from the nonamortization of goodwill in 2002 eig’s pretax goodwill amortization in 2001 was 67 million the group’s operating margins for 2002 improved to 162 from 114 in 2001   electromechanical group emg sales were 5011 million in 2002 a decrease of 36 from 2001 sales of 5198 million the sales decrease reflected the continued overall weakness in the group’s markets led by continued softness in the floor care market the 2001 acquisition of gs electric and currency translation gains from international businesses partially offset the sales decline without this acquisition emg’s sales would have decreased by 71   emg’s operating income in 2002 increased to 802 million from 706 million in 2001 an increase of 136 the increase was the result of the unusual charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and improved operating margins resulting from headcount reductions shifting production to lowcost locales and other expense reduction initiatives emg also benefited from the nonamortization of goodwill in 2002 emg’s pretax goodwill amortization in 2001 was 52 million group operating margins were 160 of sales in 2002 up from 136 of sales in 2001

percentage of sales decreased to 76 in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared with 98 for the same period in 2001 which reflects the company’s continual focus on cost reduction initiatives and the

administrative expenses of 27 million related to unusual charges   corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2002 were 48 million or 19 of sales compared to 43 million or 18 of sales in the fourth

improved the inventory improvements were achieved even though the company continued to move certain production to lowcost manufacturing sites lower pension plan contributions and lower required tax

standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” and subsequently revised it in december 2003 with the issuance of fin 46r fin 46r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is designated as a primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority voting interest in the entity a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership fin 46r also has a disclosure requirement for

measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin no 45” for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 fin no 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under

   certain historic processes in the manufacture of previous ametek products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by federal and state laws and regulations while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp regarding waste remediation at several nonametek sites that are the subject of governmentmandated cleanups in addition to these nonametek sites the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable total environmental reserves at december 31 2003 and 2002 were approximately 64 million and 71 million respectively in 2003 the company spent approximately 11 million on such environmental matters compared with approximately 20 million in 2002 the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under certain of the agreements the former owners retained or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances the company and some of the other parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date those parties have met their obligation in all material respects the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligation in the future however if the company were required to record a liability with respect to all or a portion of such matters on its balance sheet the effect on income and the amount of the liability would not be significant in the opinion of management based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters either

  results of operations

     the company reported sales for 2002 of 10405 million an increase of
21 from sales of 10193 million in 2001 despite the difficult global
economic environment which continued to impact many of the companys
businesses net sales for the electronic instruments group eig were 5394
million in 2002 an increase of 80 from sales of 4995 million in 2001 the
sales increase for eig was due mainly to the 2001 acquisitions of instruments
for research and applied science iras and edax inc as well as strength in
the companys heavyvehicle instruments business these increases were partially
offset by a continued decline in demand from most of the groups other
businesses primarily aerospace and power instruments net sales for the
electromechanical group emg were 5011 million in 2002 a decrease of 36
from sales of 5198 million in 2001 due to continued weakness in the united
states and european floor care markets partially offset by the 2001 acquisition
of gs electric and currency translation gains from international businesses
without the impact of the 2001 acquisitions consolidated sales for 2002 would
have been lower by 63 when compared with 2001 total consolidated
international sales were 3534 million in 2002 an increase of 100 from sales
of 3212 million in 2001 export shipments from the united states in 2002 were
1920 million an increase of 129 compared with 1700 million in 2001

     new orders for 2002 were 10048 million compared with 10395 million
for 2001 a decrease of 347 million or 33 due to declines primarily in the
aerospace and power instrument businesses resulting from softness in these
markets as well as the overall economic slowdown the decline in orders was
partially

                                        17
page

offset by orders from the 2001 acquisitions the order backlog at december 31
2002 was 2409 million compared with 2766 million at december 31 2001 a
decrease of 357 million or 129 primarily in the aerospace power instrument
and technical motor businesses

     total segment operating income increased to 1677 million for 2002 an
increase of 314 compared with segment operating income of 1277 million for
2001 segment operating margins in 2002 were 161 of sales an increase from
125 of sales in 2001 the higher operating income was primarily driven by the
2001 acquisitions and the nonamortization of goodwill effective at the
beginning of 2002 this increase was reduced somewhat by higher net pension
costs resulting primarily from lower pension income from the companys us
defined benefit pension plans in 2003 the company expects an increase in total
pension expense of approximately 70 million pretax due primarily to the
recent decline in the market value of pension plan investments caused by the
poor performance of the equity markets as well as changes in actuarial
assumptions at yearend 2002 in 2002 the company continued to benefit from its
aggressive cost reduction initiatives which began in the second half of 2000
these initiatives include the continued migration of production to lowcost
locales in mexico china and the czech republic and the lowering of its overall
cost structure segment operating income in 2001 included a fourthquarter
unusual pretax charge to operations of 23 million 15 million after tax or
046 per diluted share before the 2001 fourthquarter unusual charge segment
operating income was 1507 million and margins were 148 of sales

     selling general and administrative sga expenses were 1048 million in
2002 compared with 987 million in 2001 an increase of 61 million or 62
as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 101 in 2002 compared to 97
in 2001 the selling expense component as a percentage of sales increased to
83 in 2002 compared with 79 in 2001 the higher selling expense in 2002 was
due to the 2001 acquisitions in eig which have a different overall cost
structure than ameteks base businesses selling expense of base businesses
decreased as a percentage of sales during 2002 reflecting the companys
continual focus on cost reduction initiatives

     corporate and other expenses were 190 million or 18 of sales in 2002
an increase of 09 million or 50 when compared with 181 million in 2001
but were unchanged as a percentage of sales higher insurance expense pension
costs and professional fees in 2002 accounted for the increase in corporate
expenses in 2002

     after deducting corporate expenses consolidated operating income was
1487 million or 143 of sales an increase of 391 million when compared
with 2001 operating income of 1096 million or 107 of sales before unusual
charges in 2001 operating income was 1328 million or 130 of sales

     interest expense was 252 million in 2002 a decrease of 98 compared
with 279 million in 2001 a lower average interest rate was the primary reason
for the decrease in interest expense other expenses were 06 million for 2002
compared with other income of 27 million for 2001 the 33 million change
resulted primarily from lower investment income from the companys captive
insurance subsidiary in 2002 the prior year also included interest income
related to the tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001

     the effective tax rate for 2002 was 319 compared with 216 in 2001 the
effective tax rate in 2002 was favorably impacted by the effect of not
amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of sfas no 142 and the companys tax
planning initiatives the lower tax rate in 2001 was primarily due to the
recognition of 105 million in tax benefits resulting from the closure of a
number of tax years by us federal and state tax authorities before unusual
charges and tax benefits the 2001 effective tax rate was 332

     net income for 2002 was 837 million or 249 per diluted share compared
with net income for 2001 of 661 million or 198 per diluted share a 266
increase in net income net income in 2001 included goodwill amortization of
102 million after tax or 030 per diluted share and the net effect of the
unusual items previously mentioned

  operating segment results

     the electronic instruments group eig sales were 5394 million in 2002
an increase of 80 from 2001 sales of 4995 million the sales increase was
primarily from the iras and edax acquisitions as well
                                        18

as strength in the heavyvehicle business the company believes the increase in
heavyvehicle instrument sales was due mainly to truck purchases in advance of
more stringent federal emission standards that became effective october 1 2002
and is considered to be an isolated event conditions remain weak in many of
eigs markets especially in the aerospace power instruments and heavyvehicle
markets without the recent acquisitions eigs 2002 sales would have decreased
by 55 when compared with 2001

     eigs operating income for 2002 increased to 875 million from 570
million in 2001 an increase of 305 million or 534 the increase is the
result of unusual charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulting from
headcount reductions shifting production to lowcost locales and other expense
reduction initiatives eig also benefited from the nonamortization of goodwill
in 2002 eigs pretax goodwill amortization in 2001 was 67 million the
groups operating margins for 2002 improved to 162 from 114 in 2001 without
the 2001 unusual expenses and goodwill amortization the groups operating
income for 2002 would have shown an increase of 112 million or 147 when
compared with 2001

     electromechanical group emg sales were 5011 million in 2002 a decrease
of 36 from 2001 sales of 5198 million the sales decrease reflects the
continued overall weakness in the groups markets led by continued softness in
the floor care market the 2001 acquisition of gs electric and currency
translation gains from international businesses partially offset the sales
decline without the recent acquisition emgs sales would have decreased by
71

     emgs operating income for 2002 increased to 802 million from 706
million in 2001 an increase of 136 the increase is the result of unusual
charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 and improved operating margins
resulting from headcount reductions shifting production to lowcost locales and
other expense reduction initiatives emg also benefited from the

     sales for the fourth quarter of 2002 were 2526 million compared with
2373 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 an increase of 153 million or

the companys businesses without the acquisition 2002 sales increased
slightly

with 53 million for the fourth quarter of 2001 an increase of 312 million
operating income was lower in the fourth quarter of 2001 primarily due to the
recording of unusual expenses that totaled 233 million of which 124 million
was related to the costs of employee reductions facility closures and the
continued migration of production to lowcost locales and 109 million was
related to asset writedowns in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company
continued to benefit from the aggressive management of its cost structure which
began in the fourth quarter of 2000 the contribution from the acquisition of
iras and the nonamortization of goodwill which started at the beginning of

the fourth quarter of 2001 selling expenses as a percentage of sales
decreased to 76 in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared with 98 for the same
period in 2001 which reflects the companys continual focus on cost reduction
initiatives and the unusual charges in 2001 this decrease was partially offset

27 million related to unusual charges

121 of sales

  results of operations

     the company reported sales for 2001 of 10193 million a decrease of 05
from sales of 10247 million in 2000 caused by weak economic conditions which
impacted most of the companys businesses significantly offsetting the weak
economic conditions were the contributions from the companys 2001 and 2000
business acquisitions and strength in its aerospace and power instruments
businesses without the acquisitions sales for 2001 would have been 10 lower
eig segment sales were 4995 million in 2001 a decrease of 20 from sales of
5095 million in 2000 sales for eig were lower largely due to a decline in
demand from most of its businesses acquisitions and continued strength in the
aerospace and power instruments businesses offset most of the groups sales
decline emg segment sales were 5198 million in 2001 an increase of 09 from
sales of 5152 million in 2000 due to the sales contribution from acquisitions
the groups sales increase was offset by adverse economic conditions and other
competitive factors in the united states and european floor care markets total
consolidated international sales were 3212 million in 2001 a decrease of 11
from sales of 3249 million in 2000 export shipments from the united states in
2001 were 1700 million a decrease of 51 compared with 1791 million in
2000

     new orders for 2001 were 10395 million essentially unchanged from
10376 million for 2000 the order backlog at december 31 2001 was 2766
million compared with 2564 million at december 31 2000 new orders from
acquisitions made by the company during 2001 and increased orders from the
aerospace and power instrument businesses were the primary reasons for the
increase

     total segment operating income declined to 1277 million for 2001 a
decrease of 183 compared with segment operating income of 1563 million for
2000 segment operating margins in 2001 were 125 of sales a decrease from
153 of sales in 2000 the overall reduction in segment operating margins in
2001 was primarily due to fourth quarter unusual pretax charges to operations of
23 million 15 million after tax or 046 per diluted share partially
offsetting the lower segment operating margins in 2001 was lower pension
expense due primarily to use of the assumed return on pension investment assets
before the unusual charge segment operating margins for 2001 were 148 these
unusual charges are more fully discussed below under the fourth quarter
results

     selling general and administrative sga expenses were 987 million in
2001 compared with 951 million in 2000 a 36 million increase due mainly to
increased selling expenses from acquisitions completed in 2001 as a percentage
of net sales sga expenses were 97 in 2001 compared to 93 in 2000
corporate administrative expenses decreased to 181 million in 2001 compared
with 204 million in 2000 a decrease of 23 million or 113 the decrease
in corporate expenses reflected the impact of corporate cost reduction
activities primarily resulting from reduced information technology consulting
and travel expenses corporate expenses for 2001 were 18 percent of sales
compared with 20 of sales for 2000

compared with 2000 operating income of 1359 million or 133 of sales before
unusual charges operating income was 1328 million or 131 of sales

     interest expense was 279 million in 2001 a decrease of 44 compared
with 292 million in 2000 lower average interest rates partially offset by
higher average debt levels to finance acquisitions were the primary reasons for
the decrease in interest expense other income was 27 million for 2001
compared with other expense of 05 million for 2000 the improvement resulted
primarily from interest income related to tax benefits recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and from increased gains on sales of marketable securities held
by the companys captive insurance subsidiary

     the effective tax rate for 2001 was 216 compared with 354 in 2000 the
lower tax rate in 2001 reflected the fourth quarter recognition of 105 million
in tax benefits 032 per diluted share resulting from the closure of a number
of open tax years by us federal and state tax authorities as well as higher
tax credits associated with export sales before unusual charges and the tax
benefits the 2001 effective tax rate was 332

     net income for 2001 was 661 million or 198 per diluted share compared
with net income for 2000 of 685 million or 211 per diluted share the 35
decrease in net income was due primarily to the fourth quarter net effect of the
unusual items previously mentioned before the unusual items earnings for 2001
were up 33 to 708 million or 212 per diluted share

     sales for the fourth quarter of 2001 were 2373 million compared with
2582 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 a decrease of 209 million or

17 lower

     operating income for the fourth quarter of 2001 was 53 million compared

or 844 in response to weak economic conditions in the fourth quarter of
2001 the company recorded unusual expenses totaling 233 million of which

the continued migration of production to lowcost locales and 109 million
related to asset writedowns the asset writedowns related to receivables 33
million inventory 61 million and equipment 15 million the asset
writedowns are primarily the result of the difficulties the economic environment
has had on a number of the companys customers the annualized cost savings
resulting from the severance and related actions are expected to be
approximately 25 million these cost reduction initiatives were a continuation
of cost reduction programs that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 for which
the company recorded a 34 million pretax charge in that quarter and continued
during 2001

     also the fourth quarter 2001 results included a tax benefit of 105
million 032 per diluted share resulting from the closure of a number of tax

of 5152 million in 2000 the 2001 and 2000 acquisitions drove the yeartoyear

markets along with lower sales of specialty metal products offset most of the
sales increase from acquisitions

     emgs operating income for 2001 decreased to 706 million from 776
million in 2000 an 89 decrease lower profits were the result of significant
unusual expenses associated with cost reduction activities in the fourth quarter

critical accounting policies

     the company has identified its most critical accounting policies as those
accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of
the companys financial condition and results of operations and require the use
of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements
judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results
may differ materially from these estimates the consolidated financial
statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the
companys accounting policies and to managements discussion and analysis the
information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the
companys accounting policies regarding risks estimates subjective decisions
or assessments where materially different results of operations and financial
condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or
different conditions existed disclosure of the companys significant accounting
policies can be found in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this report

      revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenues in accordance with
       invoice terms generally when products are shipped and services are
       rendered the policy with respect to sales returns and allowances
       generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given
       allowances except at the companys option accruals for sales returns
       other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time
       of shipment based upon past experience at december 31 2002 and 2001
       the accrual for future warranty obligations was 64 million and 77
       million respectively if actual future sales returns allowances and
       warranty amounts are higher than past experience additional amounts may
       be required

      inventories  the company uses the lastin firstout lifo method of
       accounting for most inventories inventories reported on the companys
       balance sheet are conservatively valued the company provides estimated
       inventory reserves for slowmoving and obsolete inventory based on
                                        24

current assessments about future demand market conditions customers who may be
experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives if
these factors are less favorable than those projected by management additional
      inventory reserves may be required if the company had used the firstin
      firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current
      replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 270 million
      and 291 million higher than the amount reported in the balance sheet at
      december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

      goodwill and intangible assets  the company adopted sfas no 142
       goodwill and other intangible assets as of january 1 2002 under sfas
       no 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
       amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual
       basis accordingly the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and
       intangible assets with indefinite lives as of january 1 2002 intangible
       assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful
       lives

         sfas no 142 requires a twostep impairment test for goodwill the
      first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net
      assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds
      the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment
      loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the
      second step is required to be completed which involves allocating the
      fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the
      excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of
      the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill the determination of
      the fair value of the companys reporting units is based among other
      things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit
      being valued the company is required to complete the impairment test for
      goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually changes in
      market interest rates and other conditions may have an impact on these
      estimates the companys acquisitions have generally included a large
      goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make
      acquisitions at december 31 2002 goodwill totaled 3919 million or 38
      of the companys total assets the companys transitional impairment test
      that resulted from adoption of sfas 142 early in 2002 and the required
      annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 determined that the
      companys goodwill was not impaired

      pensions  the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in
       accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions which
       requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on
       an actuarial basis the most significant elements in determining the
       companys pension income or expense are pension liability discount rates
       and the expected return on plan assets the pension discount rate
       reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could
       be settled at the yearend valuation date at the end of each year the
       company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan
       liabilities in estimating this rate the company looks to rates of
       return on highquality fixedincome investments the discount rate used
       in determining the 2002 pension cost was 725 for us defined benefit
       pension plans the discount rate used for determining the funded status
       of the plans at december 31 2002 and determining the 2003 us defined
       benefit pension plan cost is 675 the company has assumed that the
       expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the 2003 pension
       expense will be 890 down from 925 used for 2002 the rate of
       compensation increase used in determining the 2002 pension cost was 40
       for us defined benefit pension plans and 35 for the 2003 pension cost
       for us defined benefit plans the net effect of changes in the discount
       rate as well as the effect of differences between the expected return
       and the actual return on plan assets which have been deferred and are
       subject to amortization totaled 749 million at december 31 2002 and
       will ultimately affect future pension costs for the year ended december
       31 2002 the company recognized consolidated pretax pension income of
       12 million from its defined benefit pension plans compared with
       pension income of 47 million from these plans in 2001 due primarily to
       the continued depressed equity security markets in 2002 and changes in
       the assumed discount rate and longterm rate of return the company
       anticipates significantly higher pension expense by approximately 7
       million in 2003 the company contributed a total of 303 million to its
       us defined benefit pension plans during 2002 including a 196 million
       cash contribution

  environmental matters

     certain historic processes in the manufacture of previous ametek products
have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste byproducts as defined by
federal and state laws and regulations while these waste

                                        27
page

products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time the
company has been named a potentially responsible party prp regarding waste
remediation at several nonametek sites that are the subject of
governmentmandated cleanups in addition to these nonametek sites the company
has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation
activities at certain of its manufacturing locations and for claims and
proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters once
the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable total
environmental reserves at december 31 2002 and 2001 were approximately 7
million and 9 million respectively in 2002 the company spent approximately
2 million on such environmental matters compared with approximately 1 million
in 2001 the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its
acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously owned businesses under
which the company and former owners have retained or assumed and agreed to
indemnify the other party against certain environmental and other liabilities
under certain circumstances the company and some of the other parties carry
insurance coverage for some environmental matters to date those parties have
met their obligation in all material respects the company has no reason to
believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligation in the
future however if the company were required to record a liability with respect
to all or a portion of such matters on its balance sheet the amount of the
liability would not be significant in the opinion of management based upon
presently available information and past experience related to such matters
either adequate provision for probable costs has been made or the ultimate cost
resulting from these actions are not expected to materially affect the
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow of the
company

impact of inflation

     the company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation through cost
reduction programs and by improving productivity in addition the company uses
the lastin firstout lifo method of accounting for most inventories whereby
the cost of products sold approximates current costs and therefore the impact
of inflation is substantially reflected in operating costs in general the
company believes programs are in place that are designed to monitor the impact
of inflation and to take necessary steps to minimize inflations effect on
operations

market risk

     the companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest
rates on its shortterm debt and in foreign currency exchange rates

variablerate debt these financial instruments are more fully described in the
notes to the financial statements

     the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant
exchange rate exposure include the euro the japanese yen and the british pound
sterling exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored and when
possible mitigated through the use of local borrowings in the foreign country
affected the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into
us dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders
equity foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the
operating results reported by the company

     based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in either interest
rates or foreign currency exchange rates the potential losses in future
earnings fair value of risksensitive financial instruments and cash flows are
not material although the actual effects may differ materially from the
hypothetical analysis
