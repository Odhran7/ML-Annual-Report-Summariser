other matters relating to our business 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy our business and operations and the industries in which we operate government business and individual actions in response to covid19 have resulted in continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries while commercial air travel in certain areas appears to be recovering it continues to lag in other areas and remains below prepandemic levels overall the ongoing disruption from the pandemic continues to adversely affect our airline and airframer customers and their demand for 

the products and services of our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses in addition the covid19 pandemic and continuing economic recovery continues to negatively impact the global supply chain and distribution capabilities and we have experienced negative impacts from supply chain pressures the pandemic continues to cause product and labor shortages delivery delays and increased costs of raw materials labor and supplier products and services around the world we are working with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials components and other supplies and to reduce supply chain costs 

our ris and rmd businesses although experiencing some negative impacts including from the supply chain pressures and labor shortages discussed above have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

for additional information related to the covid19 pandemic see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

defense backlog primarily relates to backlog with government customers and is included within our total backlog at december 31 2021 and 2020 our defense backlog was approximately 41 and 45 respectively of total backlog 

competition 

all of our businesses are subject to significant competition our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price delivery schedule past performance reliability customer service product development innovation and technology many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities further some nonus competitors receive government research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a us company in addition the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs 

our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts customer selections of aircraft engines components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products 

our defense businesses compete with numerous us and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics space information technology and technical services and support segments we frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers some of whom are from time to time competitors on other programs

suppliers and raw materials 

we are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials we generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials components and other supplies for our products however the covid19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the global supply chain as discussed above our inability to procure the necessary raw materials components and other supplies for our products could negatively affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of materials and components particularly with respect to our commercial business operations within collins aerospace and pratt  whitney we continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and work with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials components and other supplies and reduce costs particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on global supply chain in addition we monitor supplier liquidity and work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating or resourcing our purchases entering longterm agreements reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and competitions among suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes in addition in some cases we must comply with specific procurement requirements which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve we deal with numerous us government agencies and entities including but not limited to all of the branches of the us department of defense dod the federal aviation administration faa and the department of homeland security similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business

our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic capital market and political conditions our business operating results financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions the inflationary environment in the united states and internationally levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices supply chain challenges exchange rates potential changes in policy positions or priorities levels of government spending and deficits the availability and cost of labor the threat environment trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy given the current inflationary pressures both in the us and in other countries in which we operate we have and may continue to experience labor and material cost increases at a rate higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses and the customer and supplier contracts within those businesses we may not be able to increase our contract value or pricing to offset these cost increases in particular on our fixed price contracts our operating profits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors particularly if the current inflationary pressures are prolonged similarly expected increases in interest rates from recent historical lows in the us and in other countries in which we operate could negatively impact financial markets and tighten the availability of and increase the cost of capital for the company which could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and liquidity  tightening of credit in financial markets also could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy in addition geopolitical risks could affect government priorities budgets and policies which could impact sales of defense and other products and services our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect our business supply chain operations and the industries in which we operate the ongoing covid19 pandemic has negatively affected our business supply chains operations and the industries in which we operate as a result of covid19 governments businesses and individuals have taken actions such as instituting lockdowns quarantines border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel the unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services aircraft manufacturers reduced production rates and cancelled new airframer programs and as a result demand for our original equipment manufacturer oem products decreased in addition significant declines in aircraft flight hours resulted in reduced demand for our aftermarket parts and services airlines and airline leasing companies deferred maintenance services and delayed and cancelled aircraft purchases negatively impacting our related revenues some airlines accelerated retirement of certain aircraft eliminating demand for our spare parts and our continuing aftermarket services and negatively impacting our related aftermarket revenues a significant portion of our longterm support contracts are driven by actual usage and therefore our related revenues have decreased some airlines experienced bankruptcies and some of our major customers were unable to make timely payment to us as a result of these developments we experienced goodwill impairment charges credit losses on receivables and contract assets and unfavorable contract adjustments among other financial impacts predominantly in 2020 in addition the border closings lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from covid19 as well as the continuing economic recovery negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities decreases in the availability of supplies increases in the cost of supplies and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays as well as increased costs for the procurement of raw materials components and other supplies required for our performance moreover on september 24 2021 in furtherance of an executive order the us safer federal workforce task force issued guidance requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with covid19 safety protocols including requiring certain employees to be fully vaccinated against covid19 except in limited circumstances the implementation of this mandate may result in attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in securing future labor needs for our workforce as well as the workforces of our subcontractors suppliers and customers the mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings as a result the impact of mandate on our operations and performance as well as on our subcontractors suppliers and customers is uncertain however if ultimately required the mandate could affect our performance on contracts particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we also experienced challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people and goods as a result of covid19 the global economic supply and demand uncertainties caused by covid19 remain in 2021 new covid19 

variants emerged and caused additional outbreaks and there were issues related to availability distribution and acceptance of vaccines against covid19 commercial air traffic demand while improving in certain areas has not recovered to prepandemic levels and the timing of any such recovery remains uncertain due to the continued effects of covid19 and related uncertainty we expect to continue to experience the challenges described above for an uncertain period of time into the future 

in addition due to the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic we may face new challenges in the future that we had not experienced previously for example we provide aircraft financing commitments in the form of debt or lease financing to commercial aerospace customers who might experience a greater need to utilize our commitments due to the lasting impacts of covid19 if one or more customers exercise financing commitments we will need to divert cash to satisfy them and these customers may be unable to make payments on a timely basis or at all our customers may also experience decreases in production or delays if they fail to comply or lose personnel as a result of existing or new vaccine mandates which could decrease demand for our products and services moreover if developments in the covid19 pandemic cause significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers’ workforces to be unable to work effectively – due to facilities closures illness quarantines government actions including new or continuing governmentmandated safety protocols or other restrictions – such business disruptions could hinder or delay our production capabilities could otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers and may also result in increased costs to us developments in the covid19 pandemic may affect our ability to hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and to maintain our corporate culture we continue to conduct talent searches for fully vaccinated replacements for positions vacated due to the vaccine mandate and it is critical that we find and train new qualified personnel the covid19 pandemic also may materially impact us government sales including changes or shifts in defense spending due to budgetary constraints the allocation of funds to governmental responses to covid19 a failure to complete the government budget process resulting in a continuing resolution cr or a government shutdown or otherwise and uncertain funding of programs covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth and creating volatility and unpredictability in financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these impacts and the resulting volatility and disruption to the global capital markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely impact access to shortterm and longterm capital for the company and our suppliers and customers including heightened counter party risks associated with foreign exchange hedging transactions interest rate swaps and solvency of revolving credit facility banks 

any of these factors depending on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the ultimate duration and financial impact of the covid19 pandemic is unknown at this time the extent of such impact depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in the short or longterm including new information which may emerge concerning the scope severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as any worsening of the pandemic the effect of additional variants and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur the efficacy acceptance distribution and availability of vaccines new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact and governmental business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments among others some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk 

changes in us government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position results of operations liquidity and overall business us government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales our us government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various us government programs primarily defenserelated programs with the us department of defense dod and a broad range of programs with the us intelligence community and other departments and agencies changes in us government defense spending for various reasons including as a result of potential changes in policy positions or priorities could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity our programs are subject to us government policies budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including 1 geopolitical events 2 macroeconomic conditions and 3 the ability of the us government to enact relevant legislation such as appropriations bills in recent years us government appropriations have been affected by larger us government budgetary issues and related legislation and the us government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year resulting in both governmental shutdowns and crs providing only enough funds for us government agencies to continue operating at prioryear levels further if the us government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling the us government could default on its debts as a result us government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the nearterm due to numerous factors including the external threat environment future governmental priorities and the state of 

governmental finances significant changes in us government defense spending or changes in us government priorities policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks relating to our us government contracts and the mix of our us government contracts and programs that could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations liquidity and overall business the termination of one or more of our contracts or the occurrence of performance delays cost overruns product failures materials or components shortages or contract definitization delays could negatively impact our competitive position results of operations financial condition and liquidity us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract in whole or in part without prior notice at the us government’s convenience or for default based on performance if one of our contracts is terminated for convenience we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed if one of our contracts is terminated for default we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the us government a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders in addition we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the us government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise without regard to our performance as a subcontractor we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new us government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our contracts in addition because the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multiyear programs programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years appropriation bills may be delayed which may result in delays to funding the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services under certain circumstances we may use our own funds to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates or other requirements but we may not be reimbursed further if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable reduced or delayed the us government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program in addition our us government contracts typically involve the development application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals new technologies may be untested or unproven and in some instances product requirements or specifications may be modified as a result we may experience technological and other performance difficulties which may result in delays setbacks cost overruns or product failures and could divert our attention or resources from other projects our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities additionally in order to win certain us government contracts we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions these additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards 

our us government contracts are typically either fixedpriced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts fixedprice contracts are predominantly either firm fixedprice ffp contracts or fixedprice incentive fpi contracts under ffp contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns under fpi contracts we generally share with the us government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price we carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under fpi contracts under cost reimbursable contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performancebased fee but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect our profitability could be negatively affected particularly under fixedprice development contracts we may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues while contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable they can be ffp or fpi which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth in addition other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated moreover over the past several years the dod has increased its use of other transaction authority ota contracts under which it awards certain prototypes research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to dod contracts including justification of sole source awards otas may use fixedprice contracts during all phases of the contract or mandated contract cost sharing eg onethird of program costs they may also require nontraditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other dod contracts our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our ota contracts including any applicable nontraditional requirements moreover from time to time we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a nottoexceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support us government priorities uncertainties in final contract price specifications and terms or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability in addition as discussed more fully below our us government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential us government audits investigations and disputes we are also involved in programs that are classified by the us 

government which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs including any risks disputes and claims 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions political factors trade policies sales methods and changes in local government regulation we conduct our business on a global basis with a significant portion of sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations where transactions may be denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain crossborder transactions in addition a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations our financial statements are denominated in us dollars and exchange rate fluctuations may cause translation gains or losses when translating nonus operating unit financial statements in addition the majority of our commercial aerospace business sales are transacted in us dollars while the majority of costs outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency therefore fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the local currency could impact our results of operations pratt  whitney canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs import quotas and other trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and cash repatriation our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to regional and local political and economic factors including volatility in energy prices political or civil unrest changes in threat environments and political relations geopolitical uncertainties and changes in us foreign policy government policies on international trade and investments whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products impact our supply and prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the us or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies of materials or components could negatively affect us ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trends such as populism and economic nationalism a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or a government’s limiting exports of a unique material such as rare earth minerals over which it controls a significant portion of the global supply or retaliation by another government against any such policies such as tariffs could negatively affect us further regime change in a major customer’s government could decrease or eliminate its demand for our products and services as well as adversely affect our supply of materials or components from that county international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs and contract laws and regulations and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the us or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries as discussed more fully below our international sales also require us to comply with us laws regulations and policies including the international traffic in arms regulations itar the export administration regulations ear the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption sanctions and export laws and regulations in addition in certain foreign countries our businesses engage nonemployee sales representatives our use of and association with thirdparty foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and teaming with international subcontractors partners and suppliers in connection with international programs expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the fcpa and local antibribery laws and regulations from time to time we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration in addition we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products 

we conduct business in numerous countries that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to customers in these countries will continue to account for a significant portion of our commercial aerospace sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products particularly our aerospace products operations in emerging market countries can present many risks including volatility in gross domestic product and rates of economic growth economic and government instability particularly in certain middle east countries cultural differences such as employment and business practices the imposition of exchange and capital controls and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity of note in 2019 the us government suspended turkey’s participation in the f35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russianbuilt s400 air and missile defense system the us has imposed and may impose additional sanctions on turkey as well as contractual restrictions on the use of turkish sources for certain military programs as a result of this or other political disputes turkish companies supply components some of which are solesourced to our aerospace 

businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products as well as to our defense businesses depending upon the scope and timing of us sanctions or contractual prohibitions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions if any such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition in october 2020 the people’s republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with a foreign military sale to taiwan of six ms110 reconnaissance pods and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sales are governmenttogovernment transactions that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the us government to date the chinese government has not imposed sanctions on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions if china were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against rtc our suppliers affiliates or partners it could potentially disrupt our business operations the impact of potential sanctions or other actions by china cannot be determined at this time from time to time our businesses have sold and are expected to sell in the future additional defense products to taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact if any of any future sanctions or other actions by china in response to these sales moreover the chinese government has generally expanded its ability to restrict chinarelated import export and investment activities which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace products in china in addition in connection with the current status of international relations with russia particularly in light of potential conflict between russia and ukraine the us government has stated it is considering imposing enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia the governments of other jurisdictions in which we operate such as the european union and canada may also implement sanctions or other restrictive measures these potential sanctions and export controls as well as any responses from russia could adversely affect the company andor our supply chain business partners or customers 

our international business faces substantial competition from both us companies and foreign companies in some instances foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies or our foreign subsidiaries in addition foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than us companies 

our international contracts particularly for sales of defense products and services may include offset or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases manufacturing agreements technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations sometimes in the form of incountry industrial participation icip agreements approvals of offset or icip thresholds and requirements may be subjective and timeconsuming and may delay contract awards offset and icip requirements may in certain countries include the creation of a joint venture with a local company that may control the venture certain customers’ demands are increasing for greater offset or icip commitment levels highervalue content including the transfer of technologies and capabilities and local production and economic development 

as a result of the above factors we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry which is cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines lessors other aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies and restructuring activities competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels in particular tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions aviation safety concerns pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business as described above additionally because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery beyond 2022 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice or costshare development contracts with commercial customers which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and 

approved nonoem aftermarket spare parts and repairs spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service a reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated competition may reduce our revenues and segment share and limit our future opportunities we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing and delivering the geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft the level of orders received for the geared turbofan family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production rampup efforts are delayed if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards andor if we identify or experience issues with inservice engines we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules which could result in material additional costs including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules receiving regulatory approvals execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul services on our products hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends for our target endcustomers such as sustainable technologies as described below validation of innovative technologies risks associated with the development of complex software the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop for example our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products these systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace in addition many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and marketdriven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions the evolving nature of these standards along with the long duration of development production and aftermarket support programs creates uncertainty regarding program profitability particularly with our aircraft engine products development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers’ products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns delays andor suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development pending required certifications or after entry into service 

we operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing marketing and servicing capabilities than we do our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customerdirected cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required moreover we have seen highly competitive pricing in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win 

the work in addition with respect to dod awards in particular bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent generally a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities delay earnings and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a rebid of the contract highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products furthermore our competitors including our customers may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products or meet particular indemand technological needs before us or with technology that is superior to our existing or new technologies for example the enhanced focus on climate change has increased demand for more environmentally sustainable products and services as described below our competitors may develop sustainable products or services that are available to our customers before our products or services or that are adopted more readily than our products or services in addition our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings in addition the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products we also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and crossborder defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors’ capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration we are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod are increasingly turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

operational risks 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services and significant shortages capacity constraints production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products our reliance on us and nonus suppliers including thirdparty manufacturing suppliers subcontractors and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing services support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use which may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize they also must require suppliers to comply with various dod cybersecurity requirements a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts closing bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers price increases due to inflation or otherwise or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities including as a result of war natural disaster health pandemic or other business continuity events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our supply chain as described above 

due to the nature of our products and services a product safety failure or other failure affecting our or our customers’ or suppliers’ products or systems could seriously harm our business our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized involve complex advanced technologies are often integrated with thirdparty products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision reliability and durability many of our products and services include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense systems including commercial and military jet engines power and control systems and other aircraft parts air and missile defense systems and military sensors and command and control systems technical mechanical and other failures may occur from time to time whether as a result of manufacturing or design def ect operational process or production issue attributable to us our customers suppliers third party integrators or others in addition our products could fail as a result of cyberattacks such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products or other intentional acts the impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers’ or suppliers’ products or services c ould be significant and could result in injuries or death property damage loss of strategic capabilities loss of intellectual property loss of reputation and other significant negative effects a product or system failure could lead to negative publicity a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services it 

could also result in product recalls and product liability and warranty claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products and related expenses other service repair and maintenance costs significant damages and other costs including fines and other remedies and regulatory and environmental liabilities we may also incur increased costs delayed payments reputational harm or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract train and retain such personnel and to maintain our corporate culture and high ethical standards could seriously harm our business due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified technical manufacturing marketing sales and management personnel for our operations our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skills or security clearances in addition certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks necessary security clearances may be delayed which may impact our ability to perform on our us government contracts further we have experienced and may continue to experience personnel reductions as a result of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on our business in addition a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employees hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge in addition new qualified personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce which could result in difficulties attracting and retaining new employees loss of key employees increased attrition for various reasons failure to attract new qualified employees or adequately train them delays in receiving required security clearances or delays in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business moreover we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture which we believe fosters innovation collaboration diversity and inclusion and a focus on execution all in an environment of high ethical standards our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture any failure to maintain these elements of our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business and the value of our company further we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity equity and inclusion to the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values including with respect to product safety or quality legal or regulatory compliance financial reporting or people management we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyberattacks on information technology infrastructure and products our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology it infrastructure which could result from among other causes cyberattacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security we also encounter attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers cybersecurity threats are evolving and include but are not limited to both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of our customers suppliers subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely both on premises and in the cloud attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information classified information or information relating to our employees customers and other third parties or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties cybersecurity threats also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor availability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure and insider threat attacks such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties including mission critical systems impact business operations result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corrupt our data or that of third parties we have experienced cyberbased attacks and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency the threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversaries including nation states which target us and other defense contractors we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capabilities and to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability nature and scope of cyberattacks it is possible that we are unable to prevent cyber attacks that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period that we may be unsuccessful in defending an attack against those vulnerabilities or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks in addition some products and services that we provide to customers particularly those related to public security may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property in some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers suppliers subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromise of confidential information intellectual property or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our or thirdparty systems networks or products financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity some of these risks may be heightened due to the company and its suppliers and other third parties operating with a significant number of employees working remotely due to the evolving nature of such risks the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by threats to our physical security and other events outside our control we could encounter threats to our physical security including our facilities and personnel and threats from workplace violence civil unrest terrorism or similar acts any of which could disrupt our business in addition our business and the businesses of our suppliers subcontractors and service providers and customers could be disrupted by public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics damaging weather or other acts of nature cyberattacks on it infrastructure and products or other events outside of our control for example our business has been and continues to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic as discussed above any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers financial losses from remedial actions the diversion of management’s attention and resources or loss of business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity the impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements it security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements confidentiality obligations in contracts it security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access the us government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property including certain patents which are developed or used in performance of government contracts governments may use or authorize others including our competitors to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete in some instances we have augmented our 

technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties in addition we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms in other instances our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others which may affect our ability to perform government contracts moreover our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us in addition we may be the target of competitor or other thirdparty patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of and ownership of necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures as described above any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

legal environmental and regulatory risks 

as a us government contractor we are subject to risks relating to us government audits investigations and disputes we are subject to us government investigations relating to our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated further our us government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because for example cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amounts which could if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate andor litigate we may be and have been required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in our favor any such payments will be returned to us with interest the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies including our accounting purchasing government property estimating earned value management and material management accounting systems our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the us government including dcma claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards in some cases the department of justice doj has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the us government or must be refunded by us to the us government if already reimbursed an adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition if allegations of impropriety were made against us we could suffer serious reputational harm which could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to litigation environmental anticorruption and other legal and compliance risks we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks relate to among other things product safety and reliability personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters export control employment matters competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments or other damages in certain cases treble damages product recalls and product liability and warranty 

claims can result in significant damages and costs including fines as well as other harm to our business as discussed above as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and in other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights for example changes in climate change laws or regulations could lead to increased compliance expenditures and technological development costs as described below 

we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations as a result we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees thirdparties’ employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values for example we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and in some cases have in the past been named as a defendant in related “toxic tort” claims we are also subject to laws and regulations that 1 impose requirements for the proper management treatment storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 2 restrict air and water emissions from our operations including us governmentowned facilities we manage and 3 require maintenance of a safe workplace these laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases andor reduce the risks of injury to people we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations a criminal violation of certain us environmental statutes such as the clean air act and clean water act could result in suspension debarment or disqualification by the us environmental protection agency epa a facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any us government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the epa approves the reinstatement of the facility even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations in addition new laws regulations or governmental policies sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to us and nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business these laws apply to companies individual directors officers employees and agents us companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws including the antibribery and corruption laws of nonus countries our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery and corruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent violations of the fcpa or similar laws we have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of antibribery and corruption laws and could be subject to such investigations in the future which could result in criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management attention and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which may increase our costs affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by climate change including related changes in regulations customer demand technologies and extreme weather our business may be impacted by climate change and governmental and industry actions taken in response changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions carbon pricing and energy taxes could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers including increased energy and raw materials costs and lead to new or additional investments in product designs and facility upgrades in addition we are seeing increasing demands for offerings 

focused on addressing climate change transitioning to lower emission technologies including low to no carbon products and services the use of alternative energy sources and other sustainable aviation technologies and climate adaptation products and services we are also seeing increasing focus on our environmental sustainability commitments with respect to our operations products and suppliers as a result we anticipate that we will need to make additional investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and actions for a variety of reasons including technological challenges evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop indemand technologies on a timely basis and other risks related to the development of advanced technologies described above in addition certain technologies will be dependent upon government action such as investments in infrastructure creating appropriate market incentives and making certain raw materials available for development of certain technologies moreover we will rely on our suppliers to timely and effectively adapt and meet our evolving technological supply needs we also face competition risks as our competitors also respond to advancing sustainable technologies our competitors may develop these indemand technologies before we do their new technologies may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies we may develop and their technologies may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products in addition as we and our competitors develop increasingly sustainable technologies demand for our older offerings may decrease or become nonexistent moreover our business the businesses of our suppliers subcontractors service providers distributors and customers and the industries in which we operate could be negatively impacted by increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events caused by climate change including hurricanes tornadoes floods snow and ice storms fires heat waves droughts and mud slides these events could damage our and our suppliers’ facilities products and other assets and cause disruptions to our business and operations supply chain and distribution networks and the businesses of our customers any of the foregoing could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our costs and expenses 

financial tax and insurance related risks 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results accounting for longterm contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the longterm performance on the contract significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule including customerdirected delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity due to the size and longterm nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost such as estimates of variable consideration including award fees and penalties including with respect to 1 labor productivity and availability 2 the complexity and scope of the work to be performed 3 the availability and cost of materials 4 the length of time to complete the performance obligation 5 execution by our subcontractors 6 the availability and timing of funding from our customer 7 overhead cost rates and 8 current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components among other variables because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and expected return on plan assets eroa as well as our actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors could affect our earnings equity and pension contributions in future periods we must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit prb plans’ expense or income which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate eroa and other actuarial assumptions these assumptions are evaluated annually at december 31 and when significant events require a midyear remeasurement they may change significantly due to changes in economic legislative regulatory andor demographic experience or circumstances changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income expense the plans’ funded status andor the required cash contributions to such plans which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability we are subject to income taxes in the united states and international jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as well as our income tax expense and tax payments additionally in the 

ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities in addition to ongoing examinations there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing examinations could be expanded the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position results of operation financial condition or liquidity may be affected by the outcome of examinations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets primarily recorded as the result of historical acquisitions or investments in businesses we may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired in the event of an impairment any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination finitelived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or accelerated amortization of finitelived intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow borrowings and proceeds from divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings the availability of domestic cash and overall business expectations the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness 

we face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance a significant portion of our business relates to designing developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace defense and technology systems and products new technologies may be untested or unproven in addition we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services in some but not all circumstances we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the department of homeland security dhs under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 the insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities accordingly we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business which would negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any accident failure of or defect in our products and services even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively it could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 

strategic initiative and transaction risks 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from strategic initiatives and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected in order to operate more effectively and efficiently from time to time we undertake strategic and other operational initiatives for example we have announced plans to improve our business through a significant multiyear digital transformation initiative under this initiative we would leverage digital capabilities throughout the way in which we conduct our business and provide our products and services to customers including how we design build and maintain our products and services our ongoing new customer oriented results excellence core operating system deployment is another one of these initiatives other initiatives include the pursuit of advanced technologies and new business 

acquisitions and subsequent integrations as described below we also implement from time to time restructuring plans which include or may result in workforce reductions global facility reductions procurement cost reduction activities legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives these strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems if we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted in addition certain us government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits or otherwise harm our business or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we may be unable to successfully integrate the legacy businesses of united technologies corporation utc and raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits of the raytheon merger the success of the raytheon merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate utc and raytheon company’s legacy businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and technological opportunities including technologydriven revenue synergies and operational efficiencies from the raytheon merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of or decreases in orders by customers 

we may face material challenges to the continued integration of the two companies including without limitation 

• maintaining employee morale retaining key management and other employees and managing corporate culture; 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers suppliers and employees and other counterparties and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• identifying and achieving revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses and 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems 

the impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues reduced expected cash generation and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity in addition we must continue to manage the integration of other companies assets and businesses including the integration of rockwell collins which utc acquired on november 26 2018 these ongoing and future integrations may increase the complexity of and challenges associated with the integration of utc and raytheon company’s legacy businesses which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the raytheon merger fully or within the anticipated time frame the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred many of the expenses that may be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses these expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the raytheon merger 

if we fail to manage potential future acquisitions investments divestitures joint ventures and other transactions successfully these activities could adversely affect our future financial results in pursuing our business strategies we continually review evaluate and consider potential investments acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and other teaming and collaborative arrangements we undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities in evaluating such transactions we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities further these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including 1 the risks involved with entering new markets; 2 the difficulty in integrating newlyacquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; 3 challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; 4 unidentified issues not discovered in rtc’s due diligence; 5 the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives 6 the potential impairment of acquired assets; 7 the performance of underlying products capabilities or technologies; and 8 the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses in addition future transactions may impact our deployment of capital including dividends stock repurchases pension contributions and investments 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its 

stockholders as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the distributions we may be limited in our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions including certain dispositions of assets that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

if either distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock including pursuant to the raytheon merger or the stock of carrier or otis we could be subject to significant tax liabilities we received 1 a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation transactions and distributions and 2 an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the distributions under section 355 of the code although we intend for the distributions generally to be taxfree for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that they will so qualify even if the distributions were to otherwise qualify as taxfree transactions under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code either distribution or both distributions may result in taxable gain to us but not our stockholders under section 355e of the code if such distributions were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in shares of carrier otis or us as applicable if the irs were to determine that any postdistribution acquisitions of carrier stock otis stock or our stock as applicable pursuant to such a plan when aggregated with any predistribution acquisitions of carrier stock otis stock or our stock as applicable pursuant to such a plan would represent a 50 or greater interest in shares of carrier otis or us as applicable such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us for purposes of this test even if the raytheon merger were treated as part of such plan it did not result in an acquisition of a 50 or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us in addition with respect to certain separation transactions we obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such separation transactions notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant separation transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein in the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant separation transaction we would be subject to significant tax liabilities which may adversely affect an investment in us further under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with carrier and otis in connection with the separation transactions and distributions each of carrier and otis generally is required to indemnify us for any taxes we incur resulting from the separation transactions andor the distributions to the extent such amounts result from certain disqualifying actions by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier or otis as applicable further under the tax matters agreement each of carrier and otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur a arising as a result of the failure of either of the distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree or a failure of any separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier otis or us or b arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to separation transactions that were not intended to qualify as taxfree in addition under the tax matters agreement each of carrier and otis is responsible for i a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to section 965h2 of the code and ii specified taxes that exclusively relate to the carrier business or the otis business as applicable the amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from carrier or otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement andor other agreements entered into in connection with the separation transactions and the distributions we would incur significant losses

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview 

we are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries we operate in four principal business segments collins aerospace systems collins aerospace pratt  whitney raytheon intelligence  space ris and raytheon missiles  defense rmd 

on april 3 2020 united technologies corporation utc since renamed raytheon technologies corporation completed the separation of its business into three independent publicly traded companies – utc carrier global corporation carrier and otis worldwide corporation otis the separation transactions utc distributed all of the outstanding shares of carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of otis common stock to utc shareowners who held shares of utc common stock as of the close of business on march 19 2020 the distributions immediately following the separation transactions and distributions on april 3 2020 utc and raytheon company completed their allstock merger of equals transaction the raytheon merger pursuant to which raytheon company became a whollyowned subsidiary of utc and utc was renamed raytheon technologies corporation rtc utc was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the raytheon merger and as a result the financial statements of raytheon technologies for year ended december 31 2020 include raytheon company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 the historical results of carrier and otis are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented see “note 3 discontinued operations” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

unless the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “our” “us” “the company” “raytheon technologies” and “rtc” mean united technologies corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the raytheon merger and to the combined company raytheon technologies corporation when referring to periods after the raytheon merger unless the context otherwise requires the terms “raytheon company” or “raytheon” mean raytheon company and its subsidiaries prior to the raytheon merger 

industry considerations 

our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial economic and political factors on both a regional and global level our operations include original equipment manufacturer oem and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at ris and longer cycles in our aerospace oem and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design develop manufacture or modify complex equipment our customers are in the public and private sectors and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization 

government legislation policies and regulations including regulations related to global warming carbon footprint and fuel efficiency can have a negative impact on our worldwide operations government and industrydriven safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions government imposed travel restrictions and government procurement practices can impact our businesses 

collins aerospace and pratt  whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers revenue passenger miles rpms available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits many of our aerospace operations’ customers are covered under longterm aftermarket service agreements at both collins aerospace and pratt  whitney which are inclusive of both spare parts and services 

ris rmd and the defense operations of collins aerospace and pratt  whitney are affected by us department of defense dod budget and spending levels changes in demand changes in policy positions or priorities and the global political environment 

business transformation and operational excellence 

we are leveraging the raytheon merger to undertake various strategic initiatives to transform the company and increase our existing focus on operational excellence these initiatives include our new customer oriented results excellence core operating system significant investments in digital technologies across our business to enhance our products and services and structural cost reduction initiatives we are also continuing to develop advanced technologies including through specific technologyfocused business acquisitions 

coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy our business and operations supply chains and the industries in which we operate for a discussion of the risk factors associated with the covid19 pandemic refer to item 1a risk factors within part i of this form 10k as a result of all of these factors we expect our future operating results particularly those of our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses to continue to be negatively impacted when compared to precovid19 2019 results our ris and rmd businesses although experiencing some negative impacts primarily from supply chain pressures and labor shortages have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

while we believe that the longterm outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the point at which commercial air traffic capacity will return to andor exceed precovid19 levels we have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering in certain areas of demand however other areas continue to lag in addition while global vaccination rates have increased infection from covid19 variants have continued which may impact the pace of the commercial aerospace recovery further the commercial air travel recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation or government budget deficits among other factors however we continue to estimate that a full recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024 as our commercial aerospace business recovers we have seen increases in certain employeerelated and discretionary costs which had decreased in the aftermath of covid19 due to onetime cost reduction actions in 2020 a recovery may also impact our judgments around credit risk related to estimated credit losses 

in addition in march 2021 congress passed the american rescue plan act of 2021 arpa which included pension funding relief provisions for further discussion refer to the “fascas operating adjustment” subsection under the “segment review” section below we continue to monitor for any further government guidance related to covid19 that may be issued 

on september 24 2021 in furtherance of an executive order the us safer federal workforce task force issued guidance requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with covid19 safety protocols including requiring certain employees to be fully vaccinated against covid19 except in limited circumstances the implementation of this mandate may result in attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in securing future labor needs for our workforce as well as the workforces of our subcontractors suppliers and customers the mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings as a result the impact of mandate on our operations and performance as well as on our subcontractors suppliers and customers is uncertain however if ultimately required the mandate could affect our performance on contracts particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our expectations regarding the covid19 pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time however the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments new information may continue to emerge concerning the scope severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as any worsening of the pandemic the effect of additional variants the efficacy acceptance distribution and availability of vaccines new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact and governmental business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments among others some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk 

other matters 

global economic and political conditions changes in raw material and commodity prices labor costs interest rates foreign currency exchange rates energy costs levels of air travel the financial condition of commercial airlines and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses with regard to political conditions in july 2019 the us government suspended turkey’s participation in the f35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russianbuilt s400 air and missile defense system the us has imposed and may impose additional sanctions on turkey as well as contractual restrictions on the use of turkish sources on certain military programs as a result of this or other political disputes turkish companies supply us with components some of which are solesourced primarily in our aerospace operations for commercial and military engines and aerospace products depending upon the scope and timing of us sanctions or contractual prohibitions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions if any such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition in addition in october 2020 the people’s republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with a possible foreign military sale to taiwan of six ms110 reconnaissance pods and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sales are governmenttogovernment transactions that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the us government to date the chinese government has not imposed 

sanctions on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions if china were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against rtc our suppliers affiliates or partners it could potentially disrupt our business operations the impact of potential sanctions or other actions by china cannot be determined at this time 

we have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers for which us government review and approval have been pending the us government’s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors including its foreign policies related to these customers which are subject to continuing review and potential changes likewise regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer if we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals or those approvals are revoked it could have a material effect on our financial results in particular as of december 31 2021 our contract liabilities include approximately 430 million of advance payments received from a middle east customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute or obtain required regulatory approvals these advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated 

see item 1a risk factors within part i of this form 10k for further discussion of these items 

financial summary 

we use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment and to monitor and assess our results of operations 

– net sales — a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year 

– operating profit loss — a measure of our profit loss for the year before nonoperating expenses net and income taxes and 

– operating profit loss margin — a measure of our operating profit loss as a percentage of total net sales 



in order to better assess the underlying performance of our business we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis and the change in organic operating profit loss on a business segment basis which allows for better yearoveryear comparability see results of operations below for our definition of the organic change in net sales and operating profit loss which are not defined measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies 

we also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forwardlooking sales growth total backlog was  156 billion and 150 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively backlog which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations rpo for our sales contracts represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity idiq type contracts segment backlog does not include intercompany backlog backlog generally increases with bookings andor orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates as well as contract cancellations and terminations and cost underruns on costtype contracts 

in addition we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash we focus on adjusted earnings per share eps and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital such as free cash flow fcf both of which are not defined measures under us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies 

considered together we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value we feel these measures are balanced among longterm and shortterm performance efficiency and growth we also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes 

a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in results of operations segment review and liquidity and financial condition 

results of operations 

as described in our “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k our periodtoperiod comparisons of our results particularly at a segment level may not be indicative of our future operating results the 

following discussions of comparative results among periods including the discussion of segment results should be viewed in this context as discussed further above in “business overview” the results of ris and rmd reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 as such the results of ris and rmd for the second quarter of 2020 exclude results prior to the date of completion of the raytheon merger the estimated impact of which is approximately 400 million of sales and approximately 45 million of operating profit these amounts in addition to the first quarter of 2021 results have been excluded from the organic changes for the year ended december 31 2021 disclosed throughout our results of operations discussion in addition as a result of the separation transactions and the distributions the historical results of carrier and otis are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 

we provide the organic change in net sales and cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in net sales and operating profit loss for our segments we believe that these nongaap measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business which allows for better yearoveryear comparability the organic change in net sales cost of sales and operating profit loss excludes acquisitions and divestitures net and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant nonrecurring and nonoperational items “other” additionally the organic change in cost of sales and operating profit loss excludes restructuring costs the fascas operating adjustment and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions the amortization of the property plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired 

net sales 

the factors contributing to the total change yearoveryear in total net sales are as follows 



1 see “results of operations” for definition of organic a reconciliation of this measure to reported us gaap amounts is provided in the table above 

net sales increased 07 billion organically in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher organic sales of 13 billion at pratt  whitney partially offset by lower organic sales of 06 billion at collins aerospace the 70 billion sales increase in acquisitions and divestitures net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by the sale of the collins aerospace military global positioning system gps and spacebased precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 

net sales decreased 104 billion organically in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower sales of 66 billion at collins aerospace and 41 billion at pratt  whitney all principally driven by the economic and operating environment primarily due to the covid19 pandemic the 217 billion sales increase in acquisitions and divestitures net in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 included in the change in acquisitions and divestitures net was the sale of the collins aerospace military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020 as further discussed in “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

see “segment review” below for further information by segment 



refer to “note 22 segment financial data” within item 8 of this form 10k for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment 

net products sales grew 60 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of 37 billion at rmd and 30 billion at ris both primarily due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 and an increase in external products sales of 10 billion at pratt  whitney partially offset by a decrease in external products sales of 13 billion at collins aerospace net services sales grew 19 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of 08 billion at ris and 04 billion at rmd both primarily due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 and an increase in external services sales of 04 billion at pratt  whitney and 03 billion at collins aerospace 

net products sales grew 103 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of 184 billion due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external products sales of 53 billion at collins aerospace and 28 billion at pratt  whitney net services sales grew 09 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of 34 billion due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external services sales of 13 billion at pratt  whitney and 12 billion at collins aerospace 

our sales to major customers were as follows 



1 excludes foreign military sales through the us government 

cost of sales 

the factors contributing to the change yearoveryear in total cost of sales are as follows 



1 see “results of operations” for definition of organic a reconciliation of this measure to reported us gaap amounts is provided in the table above 

the organic decrease in total cost of sales in 2021 compared to 2020 of 13 billion was primarily due to a decrease in organic cost of sales at collins aerospace primarily due to the sales decrease noted above the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments and a decrease in organic cost of sales at rmd primarily due to the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and 

recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts as further described in “segment review” below these decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by an increase in organic cost of sales at pratt  whitney due to the organic sales increases noted above the increase in acquisitions and divestitures net of 58 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by the sale of the collins aerospace military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 as further discussed in “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

the organic decrease in total cost of sales in 2020 compared to 2019 of 44 billion was primarily driven by the organic sales decreases noted above the increase in acquisitions and divestitures net of 177 billion for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 included in the change in acquisitions and divestitures net is the sale of the collins aerospace military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020 and an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at rmd as further described in “segment review” below included in other cost of sales was an 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at pratt  whitney in 2020 and amortization of the inventory fair value stepup associated with the rockwell collins acquisition of 181 million at collins aerospace in 2019 

for further discussion on restructuring costs see “restructuring costs” section below for further discussion on fascas operating adjustment see “fascas operating adjustment” subsection under the “segment review” section below for further discussion on acquisition accounting adjustments see “acquisition accounting adjustments” subsection under the “segment review” section below 



net products cost of sales increased 30 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products cost of sales at ris and rmd principally due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 and an increase in external product cost of sales at pratt  whitney principally driven by the products sales increase noted above partially offset by a decrease in external products cost of sales at collins aerospace principally driven by the products sales decrease noted above the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments net services cost of sales grew 09 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at ris and rmd principally due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 

net products cost of sales grew 112 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external products cost of sales due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external products cost of sales at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney net services cost of sales grew 22 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by a decrease in external services cost of sales at collins aerospace 

research and development 

1 customerfunded research and development costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and therefore yearoveryear fluctuations in spending levels are expected the increase in companyfunded research and development of 02 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by 02 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 the increase in companyfunded research and development of 01 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by 06 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by lower expenses of 03 billion across various 

commercial programs at pratt  whitney and 02 billion across various commercial programs at collins aerospace both principally driven by cost reduction measures in response to the economic environment primarily due to covid19 

the increase in customerfunded research and development of 04 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by 06 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by lower expenses of 02 billion on various military and commercial programs at pratt  whitney and lower expenses of 01 billion at collins aerospace primarily related to the sale of the military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 the increase in customerfunded research and development of 18 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by 17 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 03 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by the absence of 04 billion of prior year charges related to increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at our pratt  whitney and collins aerospace segments lower costs of 03 billion due to the sale of our forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 and lower general and administrative restructuring costs of 03 billion primarily related to restructuring actions taken at collins aerospace and corporate in the prior year partially offset by an increase in expenses of 04 billion related to the raytheon merger and higher employeerelated costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 18 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by 16 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 excluding the impact of mergerrelated restructuring costs the increase in selling general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of 04 billion related to increased estimates of expected credit losses primarily due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace higher general and administrative restructuring costs of 03 billion and lower expenses due to cost reduction initiatives 

we are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive as appropriate the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on selling general and administrative expenses see “note 14 restructuring costs” within item 8 of this form 10k and restructuring costs below for further discussion 

other income net 

other income net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities royalty income foreign exchange gains and losses as well as other ongoing and nonrecurring items the decrease in other income net of 462 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the absence of 595 million of gains on the sales of the collins aerospace businesses in the third quarter of 2020 a decrease of 178 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to covid19 at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace and an accrual of 147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing department of justice doj investigation into contract pricing matters at rmd partially offset by a gain of 269 million on the sale of ris’s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021 as further discussed in “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k the remaining change was spread across multiple items with no common or significant driver 

the increase in other income net of 559 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to 595 million of gains on the sales of the collins aerospace businesses and 225 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to covid19 at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace partially offset by a net unfavorable yearoveryear impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of 138 million 

operating profit loss 

the change in operating profit loss of 68 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our operating segments including the impact of the raytheon merger the absence of the 32 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units and an increase in our fascas operating adjustment of 690 million primarily as a result of the raytheon merger included in the increase in operating profit was a decrease in restructuring costs of 625 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments in the prior year and the absence of a prior year unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at rmd as further described in “segment review” below 

the change in operating profit loss of 68 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our segments as described below in “segment review” and the 32 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units included in the decrease in operating profit loss was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of 11 billion related to the raytheon merger an increase in restructuring costs of 527 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our collins aerospace segment and restructuring actions in connection with the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 and an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at rmd as further described in “segment review” below 

nonservice pension income 

the change in nonservice pension income of 10 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in the discount rates at december 31 2020 compared to the prior period the raytheon company domestic defined benefit pension plan amendment described below and prior year pension asset returns exceeding our expected return on plan assets eroa assumption 

the change in nonservice pension income of 73 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the inclusion of raytheon company plans in 2020 as a result of the raytheon merger and a decrease in the interest rates at december 31 2019 and during 2020 compared to december 31 2018 partially offset by a decrease in the eroa assumption for the utc plans in 2020 and a onetime curtailment gain of 98 million in 2019 the onetime curtailment gain was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits as a result of an amendment to the utc domestic defined benefit plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for nonunion participants effective december 31 2019 

in december 2020 we approved a change to the raytheon company domestic defined benefit pension plans for nonunion participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective december 31 2022 the plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals benefits for service after december 31 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula 

interest expense net 

interest expense net in 2021 was relatively consistent with 2020 included in interest expense net was a 50 million unfavorable change in the marktomarket fair value of marketable securities held in trusts associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans partially offset by a decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of longterm debt the average maturity of our longterm debt at december 31 2021 was approximately 15 years 

interest expense net decreased 225 million in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to a decrease in interest expense principally driven by the repayment of longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in interest income principally driven by interest income of 63 million related to tax settlements in the prior year the average maturity of our longterm debt at december 31 2020 was approximately 14 years 

income taxes 

the 2021 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of 244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in the third quarter of 2021 172 million associated with us research and development credits and 121 million associated with foreign derived intangible income fdii and tax charges of 73 million associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the united kingdom uk corporate tax rate to 25 enacted in 2021 and effective in 2023 in the first quarter of 2021 we recorded 148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the forcepoint business and subsequently recognized a 104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of ris’s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021

net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners 

on april 3 2020 we completed the separation of our commercial businesses carrier and otis effective as of that date the historical results of the carrier and otis segments were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented see “note 3 discontinued operations” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

the change in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of 377 million and the related change in diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations of 028 in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses including debt extinguishment costs of 611 million net of tax in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal partially offset by prior year carrier and otis operating activity as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 

the change in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of 24 billion and the related change in diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations of 265 in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to prior year carrier and otis operating activity as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 partially offset by higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses net income loss from discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 includes 888 million net of tax and 13 billion net of tax respectively of costs associated with the company’s separation of its commercial businesses separation costs in 2020 primarily related to debt extinguishment costs of 611 million in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal 

net income loss attributable to common shareowners 

the changes in net income loss attributable to common shareowners and diluted eps from operations for 2021 compared to 2020 and for 2020 compared to 2019 were driven by the changes in continuing operations as discussed above in net income loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners and the changes from discontinued operations as discussed above in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners 

restructuring costs 

restructuring actions are an essential component of our operating margin improvement efforts and relate to both existing operations and recent mergers and acquisitions charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of field and manufacturing operations and costs to exit legacy programs we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions 

2021 actions during 2021 we recorded net pretax restructuring charges of 137 million for restructuring efforts initiated in 2021 primarily related to severance costs in connection with ongoing cost reduction efforts and to a much lesser extent the exit and consolidation of facilities we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of 62 million to complete these actions we are targeting to complete the majority of actions initiated in 2021 by 2022 we expect recurring pretax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately 140 million annually within one to two years approximately 60 of the total pretax charge will require cash payments which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations during 2021 we had cash outflows of approximately 20 million related to 2021 actions 

2020 actions during 2021 we reversed net pretax restructuring costs of 23 million related to actions initiated in 2020 in 2020 we recorded net pretax restructuring charges of 770 million for actions initiated in 2020 these costs primarily related to severance and restructuring actions at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results related to the economic environment primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic the raytheon merger and the ongoing cost reduction efforts additional restructuring charges to complete these actions are expected to be de minimis we expect recurring pretax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately 12 billion annually within two years of initiating these actions approximately 90 of the total pretax charge will require cash payments which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations during 2021 and 2020 we had cash outflows of approximately 220 million and 400 million respectively related to the 2020 actions 

in addition during 2021 we recorded 29 million of net pretax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2019 and prior in 2020 and 2019 we recorded 7 million and 245 million respectively of net pretax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2019 and prior for additional discussion of restructuring see “note 14 restructuring costs” within item 8 of this form 10k 

segment review 

we operate in four principal business segments collins aerospace systems collins aerospace pratt  whitney raytheon intelligence  space ris and raytheon missiles  defense rmd the results of ris and rmd reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 the historical results of carrier and otis are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 

for a detailed description of our businesses see “business” within item 1 of this form 10k 

as previously announced effective january 1 2021 we reorganized certain product areas of our ris and rmd businesses to more efficiently leverage our capabilities the amounts and presentation of our business segments including intersegment activity set forth in this form 10k reflect this reorganization the reorganization does not impact our previously reported collins aerospace systems and pratt  whitney segment results or our consolidated balance sheets statements of operations or statements of cash flows 

we present a fascas operating adjustment outside of segment results which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit prb expense under the financial accounting standards fas requirements of us gaap and our pension and prb expense under us government cost accounting standards cas primarily related to our ris and rmd segments while the ultimate liability for pension and prb costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different over time we generally expect to recover the related ris and rmd pension and prb liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the us government collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments generally record pension and prb expense on a fas basis 

segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations based on capabilities and technologies where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services segment total net sales and operating profit loss include intercompany sales and profit which are ultimately eliminated within eliminations and other which also includes certain smaller nonreportable segments segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments the fascas operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses as further discussed below 

we provide the organic change in net sales and operating profit loss for our segments as discussed above in “results of operations” we believe that these nongaap measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business which allows for better yearoveryear comparability for pratt  whitney only other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at pratt  whitney canada due to its significance to pratt  whitney’s overall operating results 

given the nature of our business we believe that total net sales and operating profit loss and the related operating profit loss margin percentage which we disclose and discuss at the segment level are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance as described below 

total net sales total net sales by segment were as follows 

1 includes the operating results of certain smaller nonreportable business segments 2020 amounts include forcepoint llc which was acquired as part of the raytheon merger and subsequently disposed of on january 8 2021 

operating profit loss operating profit loss by segment was as follows 

1 includes the operating results of certain smaller nonreportable business segments 2020 amounts include forcepoint llc which was acquired as part of the raytheon merger and subsequently disposed of on january 8 2021 

2 corporate expenses and other unallocated items in 2021 and 2020 include the net expenses related to the us army’s lower tier air and missile defense sensor ltamds project no amounts were recorded in 2019 

3 acquisition accounting adjustments in 2020 includes the 32 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units refer to “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

included in segment operating profit loss are estimate at completion eac adjustments which relate to changes in operating profit loss and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion these changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options contract modifications incentive and award fees associated with program performance customer activity levels and other customerdirected changes for a full description of our eac process refer to “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an ongoing basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts we have both favorable and unfavorable eac adjustments in the ordinary course 

we had the following aggregate eac adjustments for the periods presented 



as a result of the raytheon merger ris’s and rmd’s longterm contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented an obligation of the company this had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable eac adjustments for these segments in the short term most notably in 2020 the change in net eac adjustments of 753 million in 2021 compared 2020 was primarily due to a favorable change in net eac adjustments of 635 million at pratt  whitney due to the absence of significant unfavorable contract adjustments in the prior year and a favorable change in net eac adjustments of 126 million at ris and 40 million at rmd primarily due to the raytheon merger this was partially offset by an unfavorable change in net eac adjustments of 48 million at collins aerospace spread across numerous individual programs with no individual or common significant driver 

the change in net eac adjustments of 574 million in 2020 compared 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable eac adjustments of 544 million at pratt  whitney principally due to the economic and operating environment primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic 

significant eac adjustments when they occur are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below 

backlog and defense bookings total backlog was approximately 156 billion and 150 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our backlog by segment which does not include intercompany backlog was as follows at december 31 



included in total backlog is defense backlog of 63 billion and 67 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our defense operations consist primarily of our ris and rmd businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments defense bookings were approximately 40 billion 31 billion and 17 billion for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

backlog which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations rpo for our sales contracts represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg idiq type contracts backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below 

we believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations’ total net sales because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 

defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg idiq type contracts and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current period we reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on costtype programs

the increase in other nonreportable segment sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to forcepoint sales 

the decrease in other nonreportable segments operating profit in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by operating profit related to forcepoint 

corporate expenses and other unallocated items 

corporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs and certain other unallowable corporate costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance including restructuring and merger costs related to the raytheon merger net costs associated with corporate research and development including the lower tier air and missile defense sensor ltamds program which was acquired as part of the raytheon merger and certain reserves see restructuring costs above for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring costs 



the change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of 38 million for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in mergerrelated costs related to the raytheon merger of 148 million and lower restructuring costs of 112 million partially offset by an accrual of 147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing doj investigation into contract pricing matters at rmd and an increase in net expenses related to the ltamds project 

the change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of 223 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased restructuring costs of 201 million 130 million of net expenses related to the ltamds project acquired as part of the raytheon merger and an increase in mergerrelated costs related to the raytheon merger of 82 million partially offset by 40 million of mergerrelated costs for the rockwell acquisition in 2019 and other unallocated items with no individual or common significant driver 

fascas operating adjustment 

the segment results of ris and rmd include pension and prb expense as determined under us government cost accounting standards cas which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the us government the difference between our cas expense and the financial accounting standards fas service cost attributable to these segments under us gaap is the fascas operating adjustment the fascas operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of fas expense under us gaap the segment results of collins aerospace and pratt  whitney generally include fas service cost 

the cas expense calculation is different from the fas requirements and calculation methodology while the ultimate liability for pension costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different our cas pension expense is comprised primarily of cas service cost as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected changes in assumptions or changes in plan provisions unlike fas cas expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded consequently if plans become or cease to be fully funded under cas due to our asset or liability experience our cas expense will change accordingly 

the components of the fascas operating adjustment were as follows 



the change in our fascas operating adjustment of 690 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by a 741 million increase in cas expense partially offset by a 51 million increase in fas service cost the increase in our cas expense was primarily due to the raytheon merger 

the change in our fascas operating adjustment of 1106 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the raytheon merger 

in december 2020 we approved a change to the raytheon company domestic defined benefit pension plans for nonunion participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective december 31 2022 the plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals benefits for service after december 31 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula 

in response to the economic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic congress passed the american rescue plan act of 2021 arpa in march 2021 which included pension funding relief provisions as further discussed in “cash flow  operating activities” these pension funding relief provisions are expected to result in decreases to cas expense and the related recovery under our contracts for our us qualified pension plans beginning in 2022 as the interest rates used to determine pension funding requirements for these plans are also used in determining cas expense 

acquisition accounting adjustments 

acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions the amortization of the property plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired these adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results 

the components of acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows 



acquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows 



the change in the acquisition accounting adjustments of 29 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily driven by the absence of the 32 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units partially offset by an increase of 04 billion for acquisition accounting adjustments related to the raytheon merger primarily due to the timing of the merger in the prior year included in acquisition accounting adjustments in 2021 was 116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of belowmarket contract reserves 

at collins aerospace driven by the termination of two customer contracts refer to “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on the goodwill impairment 

the change in the acquisition accounting adjustments of 42 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the 32 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units and an increase of 11 billion related to the raytheon merger primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangibles 

liquidity and financial condition 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures customer financing requirements investments in and divestitures of businesses dividends common stock repurchases pension funding access to the commercial paper markets adequacy of available bank lines of credit redemptions of debt and the ability to attract longterm capital at satisfactory terms we had 70 billion available under our various credit facilities at december 31 2021 

although our business has been and will continue to be impacted by covid19 we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts 

at december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 78 billion of which approximately 34 was held by rtc’s foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the us taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded for the remainder of the company’s undistributed international earnings unless tax effective to repatriate rtc will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings 

historically our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue longterm debt at favorable market rates 

as of december 31 2021 our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was 50 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our 50 billion revolving credit agreement we had no commercial paper borrowings as of december 31 2021 the daily average amount of shortterm commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended december 31 2021 was 175 million we use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of potential acquisitions pension contributions debt refinancing dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock the commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance 

as of december 31 2021 we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 70 billion consisting of a 50 billion revolving credit agreement which matures in april 2025 and a 20 billion revolving credit agreement which we renewed in may 2021 and expires in may 2022 as of december 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements 

we have an existing universal shelf registration statement which we filed with the securities and e xchange commission sec on september 27 2019 for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement 

the company offers a voluntary supply chain finance scf program with a global financial institution which enables our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from the company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating which might be beneficial to them our suppliers’ participation in the scf program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers and therefore we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program in addition we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution as it relates to the program as such the scf program does not impact our overall liquidity 

we believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs further we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain debt or 

equity financing as well as the availability under committed credit lines provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate 

cash flow  operating activities 



2021 compared with 2020 operating activities  continuing operations 

cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was 28 billion higher than 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher net income of 41 billion after adjustments for depreciation and amortization deferred income tax provision stock compensation costs net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment cost s as well as lower pension and prb contributions to trusts of 10 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 this was partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of 11 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to activity at the ris and rmd segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the raytheon merger this unfavorable change in working capital at ris and rmd includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabili ties due to the timing of incentive compensation payments also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at pratt  whitney and contractual billing terms on us government and foreign military sales contracts at rmd and growth in accounts payable and accounts receivable at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovers 

the company enters into various factoring agreements with thirdparty financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately 02 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of 13 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 the year over year favorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales volume in 2020 principally driven by the economic environment primarily due to covid19 factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers’ request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle 

2020 compared with 2019 operating activities  continuing operations 

cash generated from operating activities in 2020 was 15 billion lower than 2019 this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income after adjustments for depreciation and amortization the 2020 goodwill impairment charge the deferred income tax provision stock compensation costs and net periodic pension and other post retirement income of 20 billion primarily driven by a decrease at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace as a result of the economic environment primarily driven by covid19 partially offset by net income from ris and rmd following the raytheon merger included in the decrease in operating cash flows was an increase in pension contributions as further discussed below and an unfavorable impact from accounts payable primarily at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney due to a decline in volume principally driven by the economic environment primarily driven by covid19 which was partially offset by a favorable change in inventory at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney due to the decline in volume and a favorable change in accounts receivable and contract assets due to the timing of billings and collections in 2020 across our segments 

factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to an increase of approximately 03 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2019 this decrease in factoring activity was driven by a decrease in factoring levels at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney primarily driven by lower sales volume 

we made pension and prb contributions to trusts of 59 million 1025 million and 55 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the contributions in 2020 include discretionary contributions of 801 million we make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans required contributions are primarily determined by employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa funding rules which require us to fully fund our us qualified pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based on the pension protection act of 2006 ppa calculated funded status at the beginning of each year the funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities which are dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions we can contribute cash or rtc shares to our plans at our discretion subject to applicable regulations as of december 31 2021 the total investment by the us qualified pension plans in rtc shares was less than 1 of total plan assets 

in response to the economic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic congress passed the arpa in march 2021 which included pension funding relief provisions these provisions extend and expand upon existing pension funding relief most notably by increasing the liability interest rates used to determine the required cash contributions for our us qualified pension plans the infrastructure investment and jobs act passed by congress in november 2021 further extended the interest rate pension funding relief provisions included in arpa as a result of these pension funding relief provisions we do not currently expect cash contributions to be required for our us qualified pension plans in the foreseeable future global pension and prb cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately 04 billion annually in 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company 

provisions enacted in the tcja related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on january 1 2022 if these provisions are not deferred beyond 2022 our tax payments will increase by an estimated 2 billion in 2022 

included in cash flows from operating activities are payments related to our operating lease obligations see “note 12 leases” within item 8 of this form 10k for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations 

in addition the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities we expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be 233 billion 172 billion of which is payable in 2022 purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future approximately 50 of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

operating activities  discontinued operations 

the 657 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of prior year separation costs as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 th e 38 billion decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a decrease in net income from discontinued operations driven by the absence of operating activity for the majority of the year as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 

cash flow  investing activities 



our investing activities primarily include investments indispositions of businesses capital expenditures payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments and cash investments in customer financing assets 

2021 compared with 2020 investing activities  continuing operations 

the 47 billion change in cash flows used in provided by investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of cash acquired in the raytheon merger in the prior year of 32 billion and investments in and dispositions of businesses as discussed below 

2020 compared with 2019 investing activities  continuing operations 

the 60 billion change in cash flows used in provided by investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to cash acquired in the raytheon merger of 32 billion the sale of our collins aerospace military global positioning system gps and spacebased precision optics businesses for 23 billion in cash proceeds and a net increase from customer financing assets of 747 million as discussed below partially offset by the blue canyon technologies acquisition of 419 million 

investments in businesses in 2021 of 11 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of flightaware at collins aerospace and seakr engineering inc at ris investments in businesses in 2020 of 419 million primarily related to the acquisition of blue canyon technologies at ris investments in businesses in 2019 were not material for additional detail see “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

dispositions of businesses in 2021 of 19 billion net of cash transferred primarily related to the sale of our forcepoint business and the sale of our global training and services business within ris dispositions of businesses in 2020 of 26 billion net of cash transferred primarily related to the sale of our collins aerospace military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses dispositions of business in 2019 of 134 million net of cash transferred primarily consisted of the business sold in

capital expenditures were 21 billion 18 billion and 19 billion in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively capital expenditures increased 339 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increases at ris and rmd principally driven by the raytheon merger and increases at pratt  whitney capital expenditures decreased 73 million in 2020 from 2019 as reductions at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney were largely offset by increased capital expenditures driven by the raytheon merger 

customer financing assets payments were 231 million 280 million and 787 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in payments in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool partially offset by increased customer financing the decrease in payments in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool customer financing assets receipts were 389 million 368 million and 128 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively receipts in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020 as both periods included similar sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment the increase in receipts in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the sale and leaseback transaction in 2020 refer to “note 12 leases” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion of these transactions 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately 188 million 172 million 351 million respectively which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire rollsroyce’s collaboration interests in international aero engines ag iae 

at december 31 2021 we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments of approximately 156 billion on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share refer to “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments

investing activities  discontinued operations 

the 241 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 the 175 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a reduction in capital expenditures at carrier and otis of approximately 300 million partially offset by a reduction in investment cash of approximately 135 million 

cash flow  financing activities 



our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt payment of dividends and stock repurchases 

2021 compared with 2020 financing activities continuing operations

financing activities  discontinued operations 

cash flows provided by financing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 were not significant as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 the 12 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to 703 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020 and cash distributions made to carrier and otis of 28 billion which were more than offset by a change in net transfer activity of 45 billion 

critical accounting estimates 

preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

longterm contract accounting we recognize revenue on an overtime basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain longterm aerospace aftermarket contracts we measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment we review our estimate at completion eacs on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company’s performance obligations the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis as part of this process management reviews information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matters progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of 

revenues and costs the risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customerdirected delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries technical requirements customer activity levels such as flight hours or aircraft landings and related variable consideration management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs including estimates of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of materials the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractors the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rates and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components among others in particular fixedprice development programs involve significant management judgment as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or incountry industrial participation icip agreements required under certain contracts primarily within our ris and rmd segments these obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature changes in estimates of net sales cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit are recognized on a cumulative catchup basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations our eac adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions on our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 

net eac adjustments had the following impact on our operating results 



1 amounts reflect a us statutory tax rate of 21 which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustments 

as a result of the raytheon merger raytheon company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the company for additional information related to the raytheon merger see “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

costs incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortized as the oem products are delivered to the customer the estimation of contract costs and margin considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion we regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment in 2020 we recognized impairment of 111 million related to contract fulfillment costs 

income taxes management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results projections of future taxable income the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume pricing and costs as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits each quarter management 

assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts circumstances applicable tax laws including regulations case law and other interpretive guidance as well as any other relevant information adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change in addition we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation transactions we have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” and “note 13 income taxes” within item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

management has determined that the distributions of carrier and otis on april 3 2020 and certain related internal business separation transactions qualified as taxfree under applicable law in making these determinations we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities tax opinions andor other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment if the completed distributions of carrier or otis in each case or certain internal business separation transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment the company could be subject to significant liabilities and there could be material adverse impacts on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity in future reporting periods 

goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents trademarkstradenames developed technology customer relationships and other intangible assets the fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future aftertax cash flows arising from the followon revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue less a contributory assets charge all of which is discounted to present value the fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach under this method a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k for further details 

also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms at december 31 2021 our exclusivity assets net of accumulated amortization was approximately 24 billion and our remaining estimated commitments net of collaborator share were approximately 89 billion we regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams and the related future cash flows 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets to their estimated fair values if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value in developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method respectively which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates projected operating profit terminal growth rates discount rates and royalty rates such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other things global market conditions 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 2021 where we compared the fair value of all of our reporting units to their respective carrying values step 1 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow dcf model based on our most recent longrange plan in place at the time of our impairment testing the key assumptions used in the dcf analysis include our business projections including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins the longterm growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit and the discount rate we consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary as part of our 2021 analysis we used a slightly higher longterm growth rate assumption as compared to our 2020 analysis based on our review of historical growth rates for our business and industry longterm inflation estimates and industry reports on projected future longterm growth for the industry material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods 

based on our annual impairment analysis as of october 1 2021 the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a collins aerospace reporting unit with a fair value in excess of book value including goodwill of 15 all other factors being equal a 

10 decrease in expected future cash flows either due to a delay in the return to prepandemic revenue levels or other factors would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 3 alternatively all other factors being equal a 50 basis points decrease in the assumed longterm growth rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 7 the discount rate that we used in our 2021 analysis was consistent with the discount rate used in our 2020 analysis all other factors being equal a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 4 

all other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value 

in 2020 we recognized goodwill impairments of 32 billion related to two collins aerospace reporting units refer to “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional details 

we also completed our annual indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing as of october 1 2021 based on this analysis all of our indefinitelived intangible assets had a fair value substantially in excess of book value 

the company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of our reporting units including longterm revenue growth projections profitability and expectations for net cash flows discount rates including changes to us treasury rates and equity risk premiums tax rates recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies volatility in the company’s market capitalization and general industry market and macroeconomic conditions it is possible that future changes in such circumstances including significant future negative developments in the covid19 pandemic or future changes in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the expected longterm recovery of airline travel to precovid19 levels would require the company to record a noncash impairment charge 

contingent liabilities as described in “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k contractual regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs government contracts performance and operating cost guarantees employee benefit plans legal and environmental health and safety matter s in particular the design development production and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts including increased warranty provisions customer contract settlements and changes in contract performance e stimates these impacts could be material to the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally we have significant contracts with the us government subject to government oversight and audit which may require significant adjustment of contract prices we accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the costs associated with these matters requires significant judgment the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

employee benefit plans  we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and prb plans assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators they are evaluated annually at december 31 and when significant events require a midyear remeasurement a change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income expense reported in the consolidated financial statements 

assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement major assumptions include the discount rate and eroa other assumptions include mortality rates demographic assumptions such as retirement age rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure pension and prb liabilities are based on yield curves developed using highquality corporate bonds which are subject to macroeconomic factors as well as plan specific expected cash flows for our significant plans we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows 

the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and prb plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations interest cost and service cost as of december 31 2021 



the discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost a flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income conversely a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income 

the eroa is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations in determining the eroa assumption we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets as well as economic and other indicators of future performance we may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves credit spreads and risk premiums to project longterm prospective returns differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the eroa do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required as the eroa represents the expected average returns over a longterm horizon 

net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the eroa an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the eroa would have increased or decreased our 2021 net periodic benefit income by approximately 136 million

as described above in “critical accounting estimates—contingent liabilities” our contracts with the us government are subject to audits such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations or that certain payments be delayed or withheld we are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the us government with respect to government contract matters see “note 13 income taxes” and “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of these and other government matters 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments which are primarily cash debt and derivative instruments to quantify our market risk exposure we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates refer to “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” “note 10 borrowings and lines of credit” and “note 15 financial instruments” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange interest rates and financial instruments 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing we actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level more than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was 85 billion and 116 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively  foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a 10 unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of 06 billion and 08 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

within our aerospace business our sales are typically denominated in us dollars however for our nonus based entities such as pratt  whitney canada pwc a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies consequently there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as us dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the canadian dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations additionally we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against these other currencies we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which us dollars will be converted the majority of this hedging activity occurs at pwc and collins aerospace and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of pratt  whitney at pwc and collins aerospace firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the us dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of us dollar sales over us dollar denominated purchases hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes while the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts changes in the sales profile volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations 

interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixedrate debt obligations a 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate 4 billion i mpact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt at both december 31 2021 and 2020 the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity therefore we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixedrate debt is not material from time to time we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps currently we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures but may consider such strategies in the future

other matters relating to our business 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

covid19 pandemic in march 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the us government our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the us and worldwide to address the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working as well as public sentiments regarding air travel in particular the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers and their demand for the products and services of our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments our airline customers have reported significant reductions in fleet utilization aircraft grounding and unplanned retirements and have deferred and in some cases cancelled new aircraft deliveries they have shifted to cash conservation behaviors such as deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hours and aircraft utilization requesting extended payment terms deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engines and requesting discounts on engine maintenance some airline customers have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligations 

table of c ontents 

additionally we are seeing purchase order declines in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volumes as original equipment manufacturer oem customers delay and cancel orders 

in response to the covid19 impacts on our businesses we have been and continue to actively mitigate costs and adjust production schedules to accommodate these declines in demand we have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the longterm needs of our businesses including cutting discretionary spending significantly reducing capital expenditures and research and development spend suspending our share buyback program in 2020 deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions freezing nonessential hiring repositioning employees to defense work furloughing employees when needed and reducing personnel our former raytheon company businesses raytheon intelligence  space and raytheon missiles  defense although experiencing minor impacts have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic

all of our businesses are subject to significant competition our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price delivery schedule past performance reliability customer service product development innovation and technology many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities further some nonus competitors receive government research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a us company in addition the competitive landscapes in the industry segments we serve continue to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs 

our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts customer selections of aircraft engines components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products 

our defense businesses compete with numerous us and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics space information technology and technical services and support segments we frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers some of whom are from time to time competitors on other programs 

people 

as a technology and innovationdriven global company rtc depends on a highly educated and skilled workforce we seek to advance a diverse equitable and inclusive work environment for all employees our ability to attract develop and retain the best talent particularly those with technical engineering and science backgrounds or experience is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our businesses in addition to providing market competitive compensation and benefits we invest in our workforce through education training and development programs additionally we regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our strategy 

we continuously monitor the hiring retention and management of our employees by business and function we regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees and use those results to improve our workplace in addition we have industryleading health and safety as well as ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks 

as of december 31 2020 our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 181000 employees including approximately 61000 engineers and approximately 41000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies our employees are located in 71 countries with approximately 71 of our employees located in the us approximately 4 of our employees located in canada approximately 14 of our employees located in europe approximately 9 of our employees located in the asia pacific region approximately 1 of our employees located in the middle east and north africa region and approximately 1 of our employees located in other regions 

in 2020 our workforce was significantly impacted by the separation transactions the raytheon merger and the covid19 pandemic 

upon completion of the separation transactions a total of approximately 122000 former utc employees became employees of carrier and otis further as a result of the raytheon merger 71000 raytheon company employees joined the 124000 employees of utc’s aerospace businesses as rtc employees following the raytheon merger we have undertaken a number of actions to reduce our workforce and achieve cost synergies while retaining key talent necessary for rtc’s success we are working towards a harmonized set of human resources systems and applications programs and processes that will enable employees to more easily move across our businesses and functions and advance their careers within rtc we also have engaged in additional succession planning as a result of the changes in our senior management team in connection with the separation transactions and the raytheon merger 

in addition we have taken extraordinary measures to protect our workforce in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented extensive safety protocols to support our essential employees required to work onsite we also enabled approximately 100000 of our employees to work remotely and we have sought to ensure that they have the technology flexible work schedules dependent care and other services needed during this time to enable them to work effectively from home 

table of c ontents 

due to the impact of the pandemic on our businesses in 2020 we have taken a number of actions including deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions freezing nonessential hiring repositioning employees to defense work and making personnel reductions in particular collins aerospace and pratt  whitney have taken steps to adjust their workforces to align with current and expected demand for their products and services at collins aerospace 11 of the workforce was impacted by reductions excluding divestitures and at pratt  whitney 13 of the workforce was impacted by reductions our ris and rmd businesses units have not been as severely impacted by the pandemic as collins aerospace and pratt  whitney and continued to hire in 2020 to support the growth of their businesses 

research and development and operations 

our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies as a result we invest substantial amounts in research and development rd activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements as well as to address new business opportunities 

we manufacture and service our products in over 240 manufacturing production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries including the us in addition rtc has offices in another 10 countries 

intellectual property 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses we rely on a combination of these rights along with nondisclosure agreements it security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property the us government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property including certain patents which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products while our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement 

suppliers and raw materials 

we are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials we generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials components and other supplies for our products but we may experience supply impacts related to the covid19 pandemic if its impact on commercial aerospace continues we are monitoring supplier liquidity and working continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes in addition in some cases we must comply with specific procurement requirements which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve we deal with numerous us government agencies and entities including but not limited to all of the branches of the dod the faa and the department of homeland security similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business 

us government contracts as previously discussed the us government is our largest customer representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers our us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government departmentspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as the dod’s defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export 

table of c ontents 

security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment audit and product integrity requirements a contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts contract modifications or termination cash withholds on contract payments forfeiture of profits andor the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment for cause from us government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

for further discussion of risks related to government contracting including ongoing litigation associated with us government audits and investigations see item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k 

commercial aerospace product regulation our commercial aerospace products generally are subject to regulations by the faa foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies including on production and quality systems airworthiness and installation approvals repair procedures and continuing operational safety in addition commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations 

environmental regulation our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations including with respect to the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations and have incurred and will likely continue to incur costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites with pollutants a portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the us government we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” within item 7 of this form 10k and “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” and “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected we also manage various governmentowned facilities on behalf of the us government at such facilities environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the us government and we have relied and continue to rely with respect to past practices upon us government funding to pay such costs 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including increased energy and raw materials costs 

for further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations see item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k 

other applicable regulations we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide as a result our businesses and operations are subject to both us and nonus government laws regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport controls tariffs investment exchange controls anticorruption and cash repatriation our international sales are also subject to varying currency political and economic risks

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

industry risks 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates potential changes in policy positions or priorities that emerge from a new us administration due to a variety of factors levels of government spending and deficits the threat environment trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy in addition geopolitical risks including changes in the threat environment and political conditions could affect government priorities budgets and policies which could impact sales of defense and other products and services our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has affected and will continue to affect our business supply chains operations and the industries in which we operate 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased global economic and demand uncertainty public and private sector policies and initiatives in the us and worldwide to address the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working have impacted the company’s business operations and the industries in which we operate the disruption to air travel and commercial activities generally and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses attributable to the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global supply demand and distribution capabilities of the aerospace and commercial airlines industries in particular the decrease in air travel resulting from the covid19 pandemic has resulted in the loss of business and leisure passenger traffic and is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and cancelling new airframer programs and as a result demand for our original equipment manufacturer oem products has decreased in addition significant declines in aircraft flight hours are resulting in reduced demand for our aftermarket parts and services moreover airlines and airline leasing companies have been deferring and are expected to continue to defer maintenance services which negatively impacts our related revenues some airlines have accelerated retirement of certain aircraft thereby eliminating our continuing services and negatively impacting our aftermarket revenues with respect to those aircraft further a significant portion of our longterm support contracts are driven by actual usage and decreased usage has and will continue to negatively affect our revenues associated with these types of contracts covid19 may also limit the ability of our customers generally to perform including in making timely payment to us 

in addition we provide aircraft financing commitments in the form of debt or lease financing to commercial aerospace customers covid19 may increase the need for these customers to utilize these financing commitments due to the pandemic’s adverse impact on their businesses or the inability of these customers to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources if financing commitments are exercised the company will need to divert cash to satisfy them and these customers may be unable to make payments 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact the company’s supply chains including the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide their products and services to the company at this time some of our suppliers have reduced or ceased operations as a result of covid19 this supply chain impact could also contribute to performance delays on our customer obligations and increase our costs 

we are continuing to face operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people and goods at our own facilities and at customers and suppliers in addition continued reduced operations and business disruption – including if significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers’ workforces are unable to work effectively due to facilities closures illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions – could hinder or delay our production capabilities generally and otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers and may also result in increased costs to us the continued spread of covid19 may also affect our ability to 

table of c ontents 

hire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and to maintain our corporate culture any costs associated with covid19 may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance 

the covid19 pandemic also may materially impact us government sales including changes or shifts in defense spending due to budgetary constraints the allocation of funds to governmental responses to covid19 a failure to complete the government budget process resulting in a continuing resolution cr or a government shutdown or otherwise and uncertain funding of programs covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth and creating volatility and unpredictability in financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates these impacts and the resulting volatility and disruption to the global capital markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely impact access to capital for the company and our suppliers and customers including heightened counter party risks associated with foreign exchange hedging transactions interest rate swaps solvency of revolving credit facility banks and the ability to raise capital both shortterm and longterm 

any of these factors depending on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the ultimate financial impact of the covid19 pandemic is unknown at this time the extent of such impact depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in the short or longterm including new information which may emerge concerning the scope severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as any worsening of the pandemic the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact timing of the availability of vaccines and their distribution acceptance and efficacy and governmental business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments among others some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk 

changes in us government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position results of operations liquidity and overall business 

us government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales our us government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various us government programs primarily defenserelated programs with the us department of defense dod and a broad range of programs with the us intelligence community and other departments and agencies changes in us government defense spending for various reasons including as a result of potential changes in policy positions or priorities which may result from the recent us presidential and congressional election could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity our programs are subject to us government policies budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including 1 geopolitical events 2 macroeconomic conditions and 3 the ability of the us government to enact relevant legislation such as appropriations bills in recent years us government appropriations have been affected by larger us government budgetary issues and related legislation in previous years the us government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year resulting in both governmental shutdowns and crs providing only enough funds for us government agencies to continue operating at prioryear levels further if the us government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling the us government could default on its debts as a result us government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the nearterm due to numerous factors including the external threat environment future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances significant changes in us government defense spending or changes in us government priorities policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks relating to our us government contracts and the mix of our us government contracts and programs that could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations liquidity and overall business 

the termination of one or more of our contracts or the occurrence of performance delays cost overruns product failures materials or components shortages or contract definitization delays could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract in whole or in part without prior notice at the us government’s convenience or for default based on performance if one of our contracts is terminated for convenience we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed if one of our contracts is terminated for default we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the us government a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders in addition we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor on some contracts in these arrangements the us government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise 

table of c ontents 

without regard to our performance as a subcontractor further we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new us government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our contracts 

in addition because the funding of us government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multiyear programs programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years appropriation bills may be delayed which may result in delays to funding the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services under certain circumstances we may use our own funds to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates or other requirements but we may not be reimbursed further if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable reduced or delayed the us government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program 

our us government contracts typically involve the development application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals new technologies may be untested or unproven and in some instances product requirements or specifications may be modified as a result we may experience technological and other performance difficulties which may result in delays setbacks cost overruns or product failures and could divert our attention or resources from other projects our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities additionally in order to win certain us government contracts we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions these additional investment amounts may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for new contract awards 

our us government contracts are typically either fixedpriced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts fixedprice contracts are predominantly either firm fixedprice ffp contracts or fixedprice incentive fpi contracts under ffp contracts we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns under fpi contracts we generally share with the us government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price we carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under fpi contracts under cost reimbursable contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performancebased fee but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect our profitability could be negatively affected particularly under fixedprice development contracts we may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues while contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable they can be ffp or fpi which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth in addition other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated 

over the past several years the dod has increased its use of other transaction authority ota contracts under which it awards research and development work without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to dod contracts including justification of sole source awards for example raytheon company was awarded an ota contract for the lower tier air and missile defense sensor ltamds in late 2019 otas may use fixedprice contracts during all phases of the contract or mandated contract cost sharing eg onethird of program costs they may also require nontraditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other dod contracts if we are unable to perform on our ota contracts including any applicable nontraditional requirements it could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a nottoexceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support us government priorities uncertainties in final contract price specifications and terms or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability 

in addition as discussed more fully below our us government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential us government audits investigations and disputes 

we are also involved in programs that are classified by the us government which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs including any risks disputes and claims 

table of c ontents 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions political factors trade policies sales methods and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with a significant portion of sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations where transactions may be denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain crossborder transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

in our commercial aerospace businesses the majority of our sales are consistent with established industry practice transacted in us dollars while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar the british pound and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies in particular pratt  whitney canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and cash repatriation government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls taxes or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the us or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products including in connection with the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trends such as populism and economic nationalism could negatively impact us for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies such as tariffs could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to regional and local political and economic factors including volatility in energy prices changes in threat environments and geopolitical uncertainties and changes in us foreign policy international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs and contract laws and regulations and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the us or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries 

as discussed more fully below our international sales also require us to comply with us laws regulations and policies including the international traffic in arms regulations itar the export administration regulations ear the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption sanctions and export laws and regulations in addition in certain foreign countries our businesses engage nonemployee sales representatives from time to time we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration if not resolved amicably 

we conduct business in certain countries primarily for our commercial aerospace businesses including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico morocco poland russia south africa turkey ukraine and countries in the middle east and central asia that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to these and other emerging market customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our commercial aerospace sales in the long term as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products particularly our aerospace products operations in emerging market countries can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability particularly in the kingdom of saudi arabia and other middle east countries the imposition of exchange and capital controls and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or

financial condition of note in 2019 the us government suspended turkey’s participation in the f35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russianbuilt s400 air and missile defense system the us has imposed and may impose additional sanctions on turkey as a result of this or other political disputes turkish companies supply components some of which are solesourced to our aerospace businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products as well as to our defense businesses depending upon the scope and timing of us sanctions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions if any such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition in addition in october 2020 the people’s republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with a possible foreign military sale to taiwan of six ms110 reconnaissance pods and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sales are governmenttogovernment transactions that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the us government to date the chinese government has not imposed sanctions on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions if china were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against rtc our suppliers teammates or partners it could potentially disrupt our business operations the impact of potential sanctions or other actions by china cannot be determined at this time from time to time our businesses have sold and are expected to sell in the future additional defense products to taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact if any of any future sanctions or other actions by china in response to these sales 

our international business faces substantial competition from both us companies and foreign companies in some instances foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to us companies or our foreign subsidiaries in addition foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than us companies 

our international contracts particularly for sales of defense products and services may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific local purchases manufacturing agreements technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or incountry industrial participation icip agreements approvals of offset or icip thresholds and requirements may be subjective and timeconsuming and may delay contract awards offset requirements may in certain countries include the creation of a joint venture with a local company that may control the venture in addition certain customers’ demands are increasing for greater offset or icip commitment levels highervalue content including the transfer of technologies and capabilities and local production and economic development 

our use of and association with thirdparty foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and teaming with international subcontractors partners and suppliers in connection with international programs exposes us to various challenges including risks associated with the fcpa and local antibribery laws and regulations as a result of the above factors we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry 

our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry which is cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels in particular tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions aviation safety concerns pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business as described above 

additionally because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery in 2021 and beyond changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice or costshare development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and 

table of c ontents 

foreign manufacturers of new equipment and approved nonoem aftermarket spare parts and repairs spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service a reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated competition may reduce our revenues and segment share and limit our future opportunities 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services 

of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing and delivering the pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft the level of orders received for the geared turbofan family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production rampup efforts are delayed if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards andor if we identify or experience issues with inservice engines we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules which could result in material additional costs including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules receiving regulatory approvals execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul services on our products hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends for our target endcustomers validation of innovative technologies risks associated with the development of complex software the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop for example our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products these systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace 

in addition many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and marketdriven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions the evolving nature of these standards along with the long duration of development production and support programs creates uncertainty regarding program profitability particularly with our aircraft engine products 

development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers’ products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns delays andor suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development pending required certifications or after entry into service 

we operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing marketing and servicing capabilities than we do our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our 

table of c ontents 

contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customerdirected cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required moreover we have seen highly competitive pricing in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win the work in addition with respect to dod awards in particular bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent generally a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities delay earnings and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a rebid of the contract highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products 

furthermore our competitors including our customers may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility also exists that our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete and cause disruption to our business in addition the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products we also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and crossborder defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors’ capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration we are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms additionally some customers including the dod are increasingly turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share 

any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

operational risks 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on us and nonus suppliers including thirdparty manufacturing suppliers subcontractors and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing services support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use which may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize they also must require suppliers to comply with various dod cybersecurity requirements a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts closing bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities including as a result of war natural disaster health pandemic or other business continuity events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for example the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our supply chain as described above 

exports and imports of certain of our products are subject to various export control sanctions and import regulations and may require authorization from the us department of state the us department of commerce the us department of the treasury the us department of homeland security the us department of justice or regulatory agencies of other countries 

we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products services and technology from and into the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws and regulations include among others the ear administered by the us department of commerce the itar administered by the us department of state embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the us department of the treasury and import regulations administered by the us department of homeland security and the us department of justice certain of our products services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the us munitions list of the itar and the

our products must meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards 

our products and services involve advanced technologies in highly sophisticated products the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event particularly in our commercial aerospace business could be significant actual or perceived design or production issues can result in significant reputational harm to our business in addition to direct warranty maintenance and other costs that may arise a significant product issue resulting in injuries or death aircraft grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations we may also incur increased costs delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems including through manufacturing or design defects process or other failures of contractors or thirdparty suppliers cyberattacks or other intentional acts any of which could result in potential product safety quality regulatory or environmental risks if our products do not perform as intended including with respect to safety or reliability the possible consequences include product recalls and product liability claims significant financial losses including fines as well as a diversion of management attention and reputational damage that could reduce demand for our products and services further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them 

we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract train and retain such personnel and to maintain our corporate culture and high ethical standards could seriously harm our business 

due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified technical manufacturing marketing sales and management personnel for our operations our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skills or security clearances in addition certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks necessary security clearances may be delayed which may impact our ability to perform on our us government contracts further we have experienced and may continue to experience personnel reductions as a result of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on our business and a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employees hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge in addition new qualified personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce which could result in difficulties attracting and retaining new employees loss of key employees failure to attract new qualified employees or adequately train them delays in receiving required security clearances or delays in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business 

we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture which we believe fosters innovation collaboration and a focus on execution all in an environment of high ethical standards our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture any failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business further we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity equity and inclusion to the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values including with respect to product safety or quality legal or regulatory compliance financial reporting or people management we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by threats to our physical security and other events outside our control 

we could encounter threats to our physical security including our facilities and personnel and threats from terrorism workplace violence or similar acts any of which could disrupt our business in addition our business and the businesses of our suppliers subcontractors and service providers and customers could be disrupted by public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics damaging weather or other acts of nature or other events outside of our control our business may also be impacted by cyberattacks on it infrastructure and products as discussed above in addition our business has been and continues to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic as discussed above any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers financial losses from remedial actions the diversion of management’s attention and resources or loss of business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements it security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements confidentiality obligations in contracts it security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access the us government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property including certain patents which are developed

or used in performance of government contracts governments may use or authorize others including our competitors to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete in some instances we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge invalidation misappropriation or circumvention by third parties in addition we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms in other instances our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others which may affect our ability to perform government contracts 

our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us in addition we may be the target of competitor or other thirdparty patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of and ownership of necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures as described above any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

legal environmental and regulatory compliance risks 

as a us government contractor we are subject to risks relating to us government audits investigations and disputes 

we are subject to us government investigations relating to our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated 

further our us government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because for example cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amounts which could if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate andor litigate we may be and have been required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in our favor any such payments will be returned to us with interest the defense contract audit agency dcaa and the defense contract management agency dcma also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies including our accounting purchasing government property estimating earned value management and material management accounting systems our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the us government including dcma claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards in some cases the department of justice doj has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed an adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines which could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity in addition if allegations of impropriety were made against

us we could suffer serious reputational harm which could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to litigation environmental product safety and reliability anticorruption and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks relate to among other things product safety and reliability personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters export control employment matters competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments or other damages in certain cases treble damages as discussed above product recalls and product liability and warranty claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant damages and costs including fines as well as negative publicity a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and in other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures including increased energy and raw materials costs climaterelated events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs 

we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations as a result we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees thirdparties’ employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values for example we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and in some cases have in the past been named as a defendant in related “toxic tort” claims we are also subject to laws and regulations that 1 impose requirements for the proper management treatment storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 2 restrict air and water emissions from our operations including us governmentowned facilities we manage and 3 require maintenance of a safe workplace these laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases andor reduce the risks of injury to people we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations a criminal violation of certain us environmental statutes such as the clean air act and clean water act could result in suspension debarment or disqualification by the us environmental protection agency epa a facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any us government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the epa approves the reinstatement of the facility even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations in addition new laws regulations or governmental policies sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to us and nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business these laws apply to companies individual directors officers employees and agents us companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws including the antibribery and corruption laws of nonus countries our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery and corruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent violations of the fcpa or similar laws we have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of antibribery and corruption laws and could be subject to such investigations in the future which could result in criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations cause

accounting tax and insurance related risks 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

accounting for longterm contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the longterm performance on the contract significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule including customerdirected delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity due to the size and longterm nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost such as estimates of variable consideration including award fees and penalties including with respect to 1 labor productivity and availability 2 the complexity and scope of the work to be performed 3 the availability and cost of materials 4 the length of time to complete the performance obligation 5 execution by our subcontractors 6 the availability and timing of funding from our customer 7 overhead cost rates and 8 current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components among other variables because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes in key estimates and assumptions such as discount rates and assumed longterm return on plan assets roa as well as our actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors could affect our earnings equity and pension contributions in future periods 

we must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit prb plans’ expense or income which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate longterm roa and other actuarial assumptions the discount rate assumption is set annually and we determine on an annual basis whether it is appropriate to change our longterm roa assumption these assumptions and other actuarial assumptions may change significantly due to changes in economic legislative andor demographic experience or circumstances changes in our assumptions could result in negative changes to our pension and prb plans’ expense and funded status and our cash contributions to such plans which would negatively impact our results of operations in addition differences between our actual investment returns and our longterm roa assumption would result in a change to our pension and prb plans’ expense and funded status and our required contributions to the plans our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions the differences may also be impacted by changes in regulatory accounting and other requirements applicable to pensions 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and international jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities in addition to ongoing examinations there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing examinations could be expanded the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets including amounts added related to the raytheon merger our goodwill and indefinitelived assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired in the event of an impairment any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination finitelived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets in addition from time to time we may acquire or make an investment in a business which will require us to record goodwill and intangible assets based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets we may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an impairment evaluation future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance 

a significant portion of our business relates to designing developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace defense and technology systems and products new technologies may be untested or unproven in addition we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services in some but not all circumstances we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the department of homeland security dhs under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002 the insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities accordingly we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business which would negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity any accident failure of or defect in our products and services even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively it could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 

strategic transactions risks 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any future restructuring activities expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or otherwise harm our business or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully integrate the legacy businesses of united technologies corporation utc and raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits of the raytheon merger 

the success of the raytheon merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate utc and raytheon company’s legacy businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and technological opportunities including technologydriven revenue synergies and operational efficiencies from the raytheon merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of or decreases in orders by customers 

the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

• managing a larger more complex combined aerospace and defense business; 

• maintaining employee morale retaining key management and other employees and managing corporate culture; 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers suppliers and employees and other counterparties as may be impacted by contracts containing consent andor other provisions that may be triggered by the raytheon merger and attracting new business and operational relationships; 

table of c ontents 

• the diversion of management’s attention as a result of devoting attention to matters relating to the raytheon merger andor the separation and the distributions following their consummation; 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems; and 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations 

the impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues reduced expected cash generation and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the separation transactions and distributions we are required to provide transition services to each of carrier global corporation carrier and otis worldwide corporation otis these services may require significant amounts of personnel and management time attention and resources which could adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations during this critical period of our integration 

in addition we must continue to manage the integration of other companies assets and businesses including the integration of rockwell collins which utc acquired on november 26 2018 these ongoing and future integrations by each of utc and raytheon may increase the complexity of and challenges associated with the integration of utc and raytheon company’s legacy businesses which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the raytheon merger fully or within the anticipated time frame 

the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred many of the expenses that may be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses these expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the raytheon merger 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions 

under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the distributions we may be limited in our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions including the certain dispositions of assets that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business 

if either distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock including pursuant to the raytheon merger or the stock of carrier or otis we could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

we received 1 a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation transactions and distributions and 2 an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the distributions under section 355 of the code although we intend for the distributions generally to be taxfree for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that they will so qualify even if the distributions were to otherwise qualify as taxfree transactions under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code either distribution or both distributions may result in taxable gain to us but not our stockholders under section 355e of the code if such distributions were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in shares of carrier otis or us as applicable if the irs were to determine that any postdistribution acquisitions of carrier stock otis stock or our stock as applicable pursuant to such a plan when aggregated with any predistribution acquisitions of carrier stock otis stock or our stock as applicable pursuant to such a plan would represent a 50 or greater interest in shares of carrier otis or us as applicable such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us for purposes of this test even if the raytheon merger were treated as part of such plan it did not result in an acquisition of a 50 or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us 

in addition with respect to certain separation transactions we obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such separation transactions notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant separation transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein in the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant separation transaction we would be subject to significant tax liabilities which may adversely affect an investment in us

under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with carrier and otis in connection with the separation transactions and distributions each of carrier and otis generally is required to indemnify us for any taxes we incur resulting from the separation transactions andor the distributions to the extent such amounts result from certain disqualifying actions by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier or otis as applicable further under the tax matters agreement each of carrier and otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur a arising as a result of the failure of either of the distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree or a failure of any separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier otis or us or b arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to separation transactions that were not intended to qualify as taxfree in addition under the tax matters agreement each of carrier and otis is responsible for i a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to section 965h2 of the code and ii specified taxes that exclusively relate to the carrier business or the otis business as applicable the amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from carrier or otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement andor other agreements entered into in connection with the separation transactions and the distributions we would incur significant losses 

if we fail to manage potential future acquisitions investments divestitures joint ventures and other transactions successfully these activities could adversely affect our future financial results 

in pursuing our business strategies we continually review evaluate and consider potential investments acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and other teaming and collaborative arrangements we undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities in evaluating such transactions we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities technologies and other assets and the risks and cost of potential liabilities 

further these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including 1 the risks involved with entering new markets; 2 the difficulty in integrating newlyacquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; 3 challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; 4 unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence; 5 the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; 6 the potential impairment of acquired assets; 7 the performance of underlying products capabilities or technologies; and 8 the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses in addition future transactions may impact our deployment of capital including dividends stock repurchases pension contributions and investments 

general risk 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow borrowings and proceeds from divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or longer suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock and shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness

industry considerations 

our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial economic and political factors on both a regional and global level our operations include original equipment manufacturer oem and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at ris and longer cycles in our aerospace oem and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design develop manufacture or modify complex equipment our customers are in the public and private sectors and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization 

government legislation policies and regulations including regulations related to global warming carbon footprint and fuel efficiency can have a negative impact on our worldwide operations government and industrydriven safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions government imposed travel restrictions and government procurement practices can impact our businesses 

collins aerospace and pratt  whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers revenue passenger miles rpms available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is 

table of c ontents 

positively correlated to corporate profits our commercial aftermarket operations continue to evolve as a significant portion of our aerospace operations’ customers are covered under longterm aftermarket service agreements at both collins aerospace and pratt  whitney these agreements are comprehensive longterm spare part and service agreements with our customers 

ris rmd and the defense operations of collins aerospace and pratt  whitney are affected by us department of defense dod budget and spending levels changes in demand changes in policy positions or priorities from a new us administration and the global political environment total sales to the us government excluding foreign military sales fms were 260 billion 91 billion and 66 billion in 2020 2019 and 2018 or 459 201 and 189 of total net sales for those years respectively 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the us government the pandemic has negatively affected the us and global economy disrupted global supply chains and financial markets and resulted in significant travel restrictions mandated facility closures and shelterinplace and social distancing orders in numerous jurisdictions around the world raytheon technologies is taking all prudent measures to protect the health and safety of our employees such as practicing social distancing performing deep cleaning in all of our facilities temperature screening health questionnaires and enabling our employees to work from home where possible we have also taken appropriate actions to help support our communities in addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic including the production and donation of personal protective equipment 

our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the us and worldwide to address the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working additionally public sentiments regarding air travel have also had a significant impact we began to experience issues related to covid19 in the first quarter of 2020 primarily related to a limited number of facility closures less than full staffing and disruptions in supplier deliveries most significantly in our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses 

the continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and the significant restrictions and limitations on businesses particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries have negatively impacted global supply demand and distribution capabilities these conditions which began in the second quarter of 2020 continued through the remainder of 2020 in particular the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers and their demand for the products and services of our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses based on recent public data revenue passenger miles rpms declined by approximately 65 in the first eleven months of 2020 compared to the prior year due to the pandemic as a result our airline customers have reported significant reductions in fleet utilization aircraft grounding and unplanned retirements and have deferred and in some cases cancelled new aircraft deliveries airlines have shifted to cash conservation behaviors such as deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hours and aircraft utilization requesting extended payment terms deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engines and requesting discounts on engine maintenance some airline customers have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligations additionally we are seeing purchase order declines in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volumes as original equipment manufacturer oem customers delay and cancel orders we continue to monitor these trends and are working closely with our customers we have been and continue to actively mitigate costs and adjust production schedules to accommodate these declines in demand we have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the longterm needs of our businesses including cutting discretionary spending significantly reducing capital expenditures and research and development spend suspending our share buybacks in 2020 deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions freezing nonessential hiring repositioning employees to defense work furloughing employees when needed and personnel reductions in 2020 we recorded total restructuring charges of 777 million primarily related to personnel reductions at our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses to preserve capital and at our corporate headquarters due to consolidation from the raytheon merger the former raytheon company businesses although experiencing minor impacts have not experienced significant facility closures or other significant business disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

given the impacts described above that have resulted from the covid19 pandemic we expect our future operating results particularly those of our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses to continue to be significantly negatively impacted our expectations regarding the covid19 pandemic and its potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time however the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments while we believe that the longterm outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will begin to recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to andor exceed precovid19 levels our latest estimates are that this recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024 new information may emerge concerning the 

table of c ontents 

scope severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as any worsening of the pandemic the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact timing of the availability of vaccines and their distribution acceptance and efficacy and governmental business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments among others some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk 

we considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the covid19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020 requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses collins aerospace and pratt  whitney beginning in the second quarter of 2020 we observed several airline customer bankruptcies delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines fleet retirements and repositioning of oem production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours aircraft fleet utilization shop visits and commercial oem deliveries these factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to precovid19 commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations based on our updated forecast assumptions in the second quarter of 2020 we concluded that the carrying values of two of our collins aerospace reporting units were greater than their respective fair values and accordingly recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 32 billion we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020 and therefore did not have a triggering event 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october 1 2020 and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of our goodwill were necessary refer to “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

as described further in “note 8 commercial aerospace industry assets and commitments” within item 8 of this form 10k we have significant exposure related to our airline and airframer customers including significant accounts receivable and contract assets balances given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic as well as any worsening of the pandemic mutations to the strains of the virus and the timing and impact of vaccines and whether there will be additional outbreaks of the pandemic and its impact across the aerospace industry we may be required to record additional charges or impairments in future periods for a discussion on the 2020 impacts see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k 

although the impact of covid19 on our commercial business is significant we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current estimated impacts 

other matters 

global economic and political conditions changes in raw material and commodity prices interest rates foreign currency exchange rates energy costs levels of air travel the financial condition of commercial airlines and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses in 2021 with regard to political conditions in july 2019 the us government suspended turkey’s participation in the f35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russianbuilt s400 air and missile defense system the us has imposed and may impose additional sanctions on turkey as a result of this or other political disputes turkish companies supply us with components some of which are solesourced primarily in our aerospace operations for commercial and military engines and aerospace products depending upon the scope and timing of us sanctions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions if any such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition in addition in october 2020 the people’s republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with a possible foreign military sale to taiwan of six ms110 reconnaissance pods and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sales are governmenttogovernment transactions that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the us government to date the chinese government has not imposed sanctions on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions if china were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against rtc our suppliers teammates or partners it could potentially disrupt our business operations the impact of potential sanctions or other actions by china cannot be determined at this time 

the recent us presidential and congressional election could result in changes to the us government’s foreign policies that may impact regulatory approval for direct commercial sales contracts for certain of our products and services to certain foreign customers likewise it is uncertain whether approvals previously granted for prior sales could also be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer if we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals or those approvals are revoked it could have a material effect on our financial results

in particular we have direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain middle east customer for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval due to the result of the us presidential and congressional election and the resulting uncertainty surrounding us foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer we determined that it is no longer probable that we will be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for these contracts however this determination could change as the us government’s foreign policy views are clarified therefore in the fourth quarter of 2020 we reversed 119 million of sales for work performed on these specific contracts subsequent to the date of the raytheon merger and through the end of the third quarter of 2020 and the related operating profit in addition we recognized an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million primarily related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability which we now do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers in addition we reversed 755 million of backlog on these contracts our contract liabilities include 405 million of advance payments received from the customer on these contracts which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated

financial summary 

we use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment and to monitor and assess our results of operations 

– net sales—a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year 

– operating profit—a measure of our profit from continuing operations for the year before nonoperating expenses net and income taxes and 

– operating margin—a measure of our operating profit as a percentage of total net sales 



backlog which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations for our contracts represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity idiq type contracts backlog generally increases with bookings andor orders and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments for our contracts recognized over time or as products are transferred to our customers for point in time contracts backlog is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

in addition we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash we focus on adjusted earnings per share eps and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital such as free cash flow fcf and return on invested capital roic all of which are not defined measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies 

considered together we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value we feel these measures are balanced among longterm and shortterm performance efficiency and growth we also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes 

a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in results of operations segment review and liquidity and financial condition

net sales 



the factors contributing to the total change yearoveryear in total net sales are as follows 



1 we provide the organic change in net sales for our consolidated results of operations we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of our business which allows for better yearoveryear comparability the organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures net and other significant nonrecurring and nonoperational items a reconciliation of this measure to reported us gaap amounts is provided in the table above 

net sales decreased 10438 million organically in 2020 compared to 2019 this decrease reflects lower organic sales of 66 billion at collins aerospace primarily driven by lower commercial aerospace oem sales and lower commercial aerospace aftermarket sales partially offset by higher military sales the declines in commercial aerospace oem sales and commercial aerospace aftermarket sales were primarily due to the current economic environment principally driven by the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in lower flight hours aircraft fleet utilization and commercial oem deliveries the decrease in net sales also reflects lower organic sales of 41 billion at pratt  whitney primarily due to lower commercial aftermarket sales due to a significant reduction in shop visits and related spare part sales and lower commercial oem sales primarily due to a significant reduction in commercial engine deliveries all principally driven by the current economic and operating environment primarily due to the covid19 pandemic the decrease at pratt  whitney was partially offset by higher military sales primarily driven by an increase in f135 engine sales and aftermarket growth on multiple platforms the 21662 million sales increase in acquisitions and divestitures net in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 included in the change in acquisitions and divestitures net was the sale of the collins aerospace military global positioning system gps and spacebased precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020 as further discussed in “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

net sales increased 2351 million organically in 2019 compared to 2018 this increase reflects higher organic sales of 16 billion at pratt  whitney primarily driven by higher military commercial oem and commercial aftermarket sales the increase in net sales also reflects higher organic sales of 11 billion at collins aerospace primarily driven by higher commercial aftermarket and military sales partially offset by lower commercial aerospace oem sales the 8370 million sales increase in acquisitions and divestitures net in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily driven by the rockwell acquisition 

the composition of external net sales by products and services sales for 2020 was approximately the following 





net products sales grew 10321 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external product sales of 184 billion due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external product sales of 53 billion 

table of c ontents 

at collins aerospace and 28 billion at pratt  whitney net services sales grew 917 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of 34 billion due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external services sales of 13 billion at pratt  whitney and 12 billion at collins aerospace 

net products sales grew 8857 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external product sales of 73 billion at collins aerospace principally driven by the rockwell acquisition and an increase in external product sales of 16 billion at pratt  whitney net services sales grew 1791 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of 19 billion at collins aerospace primarily due to the rockwell acquisition 

our sales to major customers were as follows 



1 excludes foreign military sales through the us government 

cost of products and services sold   



the factors contributing to the change yearoveryear in total cost of products and services sold are as follows 



1 we provide the organic change in cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of our business which allows for better yearoveryear comparability the organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures net restructuring costs costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments and other significant nonrecurring and nonoperational items a reconciliation of this measure to reported us gaap amounts is provided in the table above 

the organic decrease in total cost of products and services sold in 2020 compared to 2019 of 4432 million was primarily driven by the organic sales decreases noted above the increase in acquisitions and divestitures net of 17696 million in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 included in the change in acquisitions and divestitures net is the sale of the collins aerospace military gps and spacebased precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020 as further discussed in “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k and an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at rmd as further described in “segment review” below included in the decrease in other of 8 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was prior year amortization of inventory fair value stepup associated with the rockwell collins acquisition of 181 million at collins aerospace partially offset by an 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at pratt  whitney in the current year 

the organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2019 compared to 2018 of 1781 million was primarily driven by the organic sales increases noted above the increase in acquisitions and divestitures net of 5241 million for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by the rockwell acquisition the decrease in other of 277 million primarily reflects the absence of a 2018 customer contract settlement at pratt  whitney

net products cost of sales grew 11227 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external product cost of sales due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by decreases in external product cost of sales at collins aerospace and pratt  whitney net services cost of sales grew 2231 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales due to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by a decrease in external services cost of sales at collins aerospace 

net products cost of sales grew 5827 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external product cost of sales at collins aerospace primarily due to the rockwell acquisition and at pratt  whitney net services cost of sales grew 1306 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at collins aerospace primarily due to the rockwell acquisition 

research and development 



1 customerfunded research and development costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 

research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and therefore yearoveryear fluctuations in spending levels are expected the increase in companyfunded research and development of 130 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by 06 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 partially offset by lower expenses of 03 billion across various commercial programs at pratt  whitney and 02 billion across various commercial programs at collins aerospace both principally driven by cost reduction measures in response to the current economic environment primarily due to covid19 the increase in companyfunded research and development of 574 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by 05 billion related to the rockwell acquisition excluding this impact collins aerospace companyfunded research and development increased 01 billion driven by higher expenses across various commercial programs 

the increase in customerfunded research and development of 1828 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by 17 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 the increase in customerfunded research and development of 766 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by 08 billion related to the rockwell acquisition 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative expenses increased 1829 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by 16 billion related to the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 excluding the impact of mergerrelated restructuring costs the increase in selling general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of 04 billion related to increased estimates of expected credit losses primarily due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace higher general and administrative restructuring costs of 03 billion and lower expenses due to cost reduction initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 847 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by 06 billion of incremental selling general and administrative expenses resulting from the rockwell acquisition and 01 billion of costs 

table of c ontents 

associated with the raytheon merger the increase in selling general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of 02 billion at collins aerospace primarily driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses partially offset by synergy capture related to the rockwell acquisition 

we are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive as appropriate the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on selling general and administrative expenses see “note 14 restructuring costs” within item 8 of this form 10k and restructuring costs below for further discussion 

other income net 



other income net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities royalty income foreign exchange gains and losses as well as other ongoing and nonrecurring items the increase in other income net of 559 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to 595 million of gains on the sales of the collins aerospace businesses as further discussed in “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k and 225 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to covid19 at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace partially offset by a net unfavorable yearoveryear impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of 138 million 

the decrease in other income net of 57 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a net unfavorable impact of foreign exchange gains and losses 

operating profit loss 



the change in operating profit loss of 6803 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our segments as described below in “segment review” and the 3183 million goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units included in the change in operating profit loss was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of 1057 million related to the raytheon merger an increase in restructuring costs of 527 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our collins aerospace segment and restructuring actions in connection with the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 and an unfavorable profit impact of 516 million related to inventory reserves contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at rmd as further described in “segment review” below 

the increase in operating profit loss of 2037 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by operating performance at our segments as described below in “segment review” included in the increase in operating profit loss was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of 375 million primarily related to the rockwell acquisition and increase in restructuring costs of 93 million primarily related to actions taken at our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments 

nonservice pension income expense 



the change in nonservice pension income expense of 73 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the inclusion of raytheon company plans in 2020 as a result of the raytheon merger and a decrease in the interest rates at december 31 2019 and during 2020 compared to december 31 2018 partially offset by a decrease in the expected return on plan assets eroa assumption for the utc plans in 2020 and a onetime curtailment gain of 98 million in 2019 the onetime curtailment gain was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits as a result of an amendment to the utc domestic defined benefit plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for nonunion participants effective december 31 2019 

the change in nonservice pension income expense of 170 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven the inclusion of rockwell collins plans in 2019 as a result of the rockwell collins acquisition and a onetime curtailment gain of 98 million in 2019 

table of c ontents 

interest expense net 



interest expense net decreased 225 million in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to a decrease in interest expense principally driven by the repayment of longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in interest income principally driven by interest income of 63 million related to tax settlements in the prior year the average maturity of our longterm debt at december 31 2020 was approximately 14 years 

interest expense net increased 559 million in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by debt acquired from the rockwell acquisition and the impact of the august 16 2018 issuance of notes representing 11 billion in aggregate principal amount the average maturity of our longterm debt at december 31 2019 was approximately 10 years 

income taxes 



the 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of 575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 2353 million the loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the 3183 million goodwill impairment as described in “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k most of which is nondeductible for tax purposes tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of 367 million resulting from the separation transactions and the raytheon merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and incremental tax expense of 177 million related to the disposal of businesses including the sales of the collins aerospace and ris businesses and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell forcepoint as described in “note 2 business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k as a result of the separation transactions and the restructuring charges recognized in 2020 tax expense also includes 49 million related to revaluation of the tax benefit for certain international tax incentives as the company no longer expects to meet the incentive requirements also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of 142 million associated with us research and development credits and 83 million associated with foreign derived intangible income fdii 

the 2019 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of 290 million primarily associated with the conclusion of the audit by the examination division of the internal revenue service irs for the company’s 2014 2015 and 2016 tax years and the filing by a subsidiary of the company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the italian tax authority the 2019 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of 138 million associated with fdii and 101 million related to us research and development credits 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja was enacted the 2018 effective tax rate reflects a net charge of 744 million for tcja related adjustments the amount primarily relates to nonus taxes that will become due when previously reinvested earnings of certain international subsidiaries are remitted the 2018 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of 102 million associated with fdii and 73 million related to us research  development credits

net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners 



on april 3 2020 we completed the separation of our commercial businesses carrier and otis effective as of such date the historical results of the carrier and otis segments have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented see “note 3 discontinued operations” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

the change in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of 2437 million and the related change in diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations of 265 in 2020 compared to 2019 was 

table of c ontents 

primarily due to prior year carrier and otis operating activity as the separation transactions occurred on april 3 2020 partially offset by higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses as discussed below 

net income loss from discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 includes 888 million net of tax and 1284 million net of tax respectively of costs associated with the company’s separation of its commercial businesses separation costs in 2020 primarily related to debt extinguishment costs of 611 million in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal 

the change in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of 2026 million and the related change in diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations of 265 in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the increased costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses in 2019 and the absence of a gain on carrier’s sale of taylor company of 591 million net of tax in 2018 

net income loss attributable to common shareowners 



the change in net income loss attributable to common shareowners and diluted eps from operations for 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the decrease in continuing operations as discussed above in net income loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners and the decrease from discontinued operations as discussed above in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners 

the change in net income loss attributable to common shareowners and diluted eps from operations for 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the increase in continuing operations as discussed above in net income loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners partially offset by the decrease from discontinued operations as discussed above in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners 

restructuring costs 



restructuring actions are an essential component of our operating margin improvement efforts and relate to existing and recently acquired operations charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of field and manufacturing operations and costs to exit legacy programs we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions 

2020 actions during 2020 we recorded net pretax restructuring charges of 770 million for restructuring efforts initiated in 2020 primarily related to severance and restructuring actions at pratt  whitney and collins aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results related to the current economic environment primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic the raytheon merger and the ongoing cost reduction efforts we expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges of 40 million to complete these actions we are targeting to complete in 2021 the majority of actions initiated in 2020 we expect recurring pretax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately 11 billion annually within one to two years approximately 80 of the total pretax charge will require cash payments which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations during 2020 we had cash outflows of approximately 400 million related to the 2020 actions 

2019 actions during 2020 and 2019 we recorded net pretax restructuring charges of 10 million and 162 million respectively for actions initiated in 2019 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of 58 million to complete these actions we are targeting to complete in 2021 the majority of the remaining workforce and all facility related cost reduction actions initiated in 2019 we expect annual recurring pretax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately 200 million annually within two years of initiating these actions approximately 90 of the total pretax charge will require cash payments which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations during 2020 we had cash outflows of approximately 40 million related to the 2019 actions 

in addition during 2020 we reversed 3 million of net pretax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2018 and prior in 2019 and 2018 we recorded 83 million and 158 million respectively of net pretax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2018 and prior for additional discussion of restructuring see “note 14 restructuring costs” within item 8 of this form 10k

segment review 

a s discussed further above in business overview o n april 3 2020 united technologies corporation utc completed the separation transactions and on april 3 2020 completed the raytheon merger with united technologies corporation being renamed raytheon technologies corporation as a result of these transactions we now operate in four principal business segments collins aerospace systems collins aerospace pratt  whitney raytheon intelligence  space ris and raytheon missiles  defense rmd the results of ris and rmd reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 the historical results of carrier and otis are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 

for a detailed description of our businesses see “business” within item 1 of this form 10k 

in conjunction with the raytheon merger we revised our measurement of segment performance to reflect how management now reviews and evaluates operating performance under the new segment performance measurement certain acquisition accounting adjustments are now excluded from segments’ results in order to better represent the ongoing operational performance of those segments in addition the majority of corporate expenses are now allocated to the segments excluding certain items that remain at corporate because they are not included in management’s review of the segments’ results historical results discussion and presentation of our business segments reflect the impact of these adjustments for all periods presented 

also as a result of the raytheon merger we now present a fascas operating adjustment outside of segment results which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit prb expense under the financial accounting standards fas requirements of us gaap and our pension and prb expense under us government cost accounting standards cas primarily related to our ris and rmd segments while the ultimate liability for pension and prb costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different over time we generally expect to recover the related ris and rmd pension and prb liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the us government because the collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments generally record pension and prb expense on a fas basis historical results were not impacted by this change in segment reporting 

segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations based on capabilities and technologies where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services segment total net sales and operating profit include intercompany sales and profit which are ultimately eliminated within eliminations and other which also includes certain smaller nonreportable segments for our defense contracts where the primary customer is the us government subject to federal acquisition regulation far part 12 our intercompany sales and profit is generally recorded at costplus a specified fee which may differ from what the selling entity would be able to obtain on sales to external customers segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments the fascas operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses as further discussed below 

we attempt to quantify material factors within our discussion of the results of each segment whenever those factors are determinable however in some instances the factors we cite within our segment discussion are based upon input measures or qualitative information that does not lend itself to quantification when discussed in the context of the financial results measured on an output basis and are not therefore quantified in the below discussions 

given the nature of our business we believe that total net sales and operating profit and the related operating profit margin percentage which we disclose and discuss at the segment level are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance as described below 

total net sales total net sales by segment were as follows 



table of c ontents 

operating profit loss operating profit loss by segment was as follows 



1 acquisition accounting adjustments in 2020 includes the 32 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two collins aerospace reporting units refer to “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

included in segment operating profit are estimate at completion eac adjustments which relate to changes in operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion these changes reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates for a full description of our eac process refer to “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an ongoing basis we have both favorable and unfavorable eac adjustments we had the following aggregate eac adjustments for the periods presented 



as a result of the raytheon merger ris’s and rmd’s longterm contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date since only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represents an obligation of the company this has had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable eac adjustments for these segments in the shortterm with the exception of eac adjustments related to loss reserves the change in net eac adjustments of 574 million in 2020 compared 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable eac adjustments of 544 million at pratt  whitney principally due to the current economic and operating environment primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic net eac adjustments in 2019 were relatively consistent with 2018 significant eac adjustments in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below refer to the individual segment results for further information 

defense backlog and defense bookings we believe defense backlog and defense bookings are relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our defense operations’ performance our defense operations consist primarily of our ris and rmd businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney segments defense backlog was approximately 673 billion and 223 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively out of total backlog including commercial of 1501 billion and 1117 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively defense bookings were approximately 312 billion 169 billion and 141 billion for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

defense backlog which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations for our defense contracts represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg idiq type contracts defense backlog is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 

defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated we believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations’ total net sales because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period 

defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under orderingtype contracts eg idiq type contracts and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current period we reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of c ontents 

directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on costtype programs 

defense bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period which are subject to numerous factors including 1 the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs 2 customer budgets and other fiscal constraints 3 political and economic and other environmental factors 4 the timing of customer negotiations 5 the timing of governmental approvals and notifications and 6 the timing of option exercises or increases in scope in addition due to these factors quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period particularly on a segment basis as a result we believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods and that shorter term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend

2020 compared with 2019 

the organic sales decrease of 66 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace oem sales of 37 billion and lower commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of 34 billion including declines across all aftermarket sales channels these reductions were primarily due to the current economic environment principally driven by the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in lower flight hours aircraft fleet utilization and commercial oem deliveries this decrease was partially offset by higher military sales of 06 billion included in the organic sales decrease were lower commercial aerospace oem and aftermarket sales of approximately 10 billion related to the boeing 737 max program and fewer upgrades due to certain regulatory mandates that were primarily completed in early 2020 

the organic profit decrease of 36 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to lower commercial aerospace operating profit of 40 billion principally driven by the lower commercial aerospace oem and aftermarket sales volume discussed above included in the lower commercial oem operating profit were 157 million of significant unfavorable adjustments principally driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft the decrease was partially offset by lower research and development expenses of 02 billion which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives included in the operating profit decrease was 125 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses 

included in organic profit in 2020 was other income of 72 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to covid19 and 12 million related to the favorable impact of a contract related matter in the first quarter of 2020

the organic profit decrease of 21 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower commercial aftermarket operating profit of 24 billion driven by the sales volume decrease discussed above unfavorable mix a 334 million unfavorable eac adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period an unfavorable eac adjustment of 129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract and 86 million related to an unfavorable eac adjustment and increased allowances for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits the decrease was also driven by higher selling general and administrative expenses of 02 billion primarily driven by 257 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses this decrease in organic profit was partially offset by lower research and development costs of 03 billion which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives and other income of 153 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to covid19 

included in organic profit was an increase in net unfavorable eac adjustments of 544 million which included the unfavorable eac adjustments discussed above and significant net unfavorable eac adjustments of 62 million based on a portfolio review of our commercial aftermarket programs in the second quarter of 2020 in consideration of the estimated lower flight hours a change in the estimated number of shop visits and the related amount of estimated costs also included was an unfavorable eac adjustment of 44 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a military program primarily driven by a shift in estimated overhead costs due to the lower commercial engine activity discussed above 

the decrease in other operating profit of 187 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets in the current year and 43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement in the current year 

2019 compared with 2018 

the organic sales increase of 16 billion primarily reflects higher military sales of 08 billion higher commercial oem sales of 05 billion and higher commercial aftermarket sales of 02 billion 

the organic profit increase of 02 billion was primarily driven by higher military margin contribution of 02 billion driven by the sales increase noted above and higher commercial oem margin contribution of 01 billion primarily driven by continued yearoveryear cost reduction and favorable mix on large commercial engine shipments these increases were partially offset by higher research and development costs and selling general and administrative expenses of 01 billion 

the 03 billion increase in other operating profit primarily reflects the absence of a 2018 customer contract settlement

liquidity and financial condition 



we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures customer financing requirements investments in businesses dividends common stock repurchases pension funding access to the commercial paper markets adequacy of available bank lines of credit redemptions of debt and the ability to attract longterm capital at satisfactory terms we had 684 billion available under our various credit facilities at december 31 2020 

as discussed above in business overview in response to the covid19 we have taken actions to preserve capital and protect the longterm needs of our business although our business has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by covid19 we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act along with earlier issued irs guidance provides for a net deferral of payroll tax payments we did not realize any cash flows benefit in 2020 and do not expect an impact to future years’ cash flows from a net deferral of payroll tax payments in addition deferrals of required estimated federal foreign and state income tax payments due to the cares act and other similar state and foreign stimulus incentives only impacted the timing of these payments within the year the cares act among other things also contains numerous other provisions which may impact us we continue to refine our understanding of the impact of the cares act on our business and ongoing government guidance related to covid19 that may be issued  we may be entitled to recovery for certain costs through the 

table of c ontents 

pricing of our products and services to the us government however we do not believe these costs are probable of recovery at this time and therefore have not assumed any recovery within our eacs 

at december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 88 billion of which approximately 45 was held by rtc’s foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the us as such we recorded the taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings for the remainder of the company’s undistributed international earnings unless tax effective to repatriate rtc will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings we repatriated 23 billion and 16 billion of cash for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

on occasion we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of such restricted cash was 30 million and 24 million respectively 

historically our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue longterm debt at favorable market rates 

as of december 31 2020 our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was 50 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our 50 billion revolving credit agreement we had 160 million of commercial paper borrowings as of december 31 2020 the maximum amount of shortterm commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point in time during the year ended december 31 2020 was 1904 million we use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes including the funding of potential acquisitions pension contributions debt refinancing dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock the commercial paper notes outstanding have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance 

in preparation for and in anticipation of the separation transactions the distributions and the raytheon merger the company entered into and terminated a number of credit agreements refer to “note 10 borrowings and lines of credit” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

on march 16 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 50 billion which became available upon completion of the raytheon merger on april 3 2020 this credit agreement matures on april 3 2025 on may 6 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 20 billion this credit agreement matures on may 5 2021 as of december 31 2020 we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 70 billion and there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements 

we have an existing universal shelf registration statement which we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on september 27 2019 for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement 

the company has offered a voluntary supply chain finance scf program with a global financial institution for more than 10 years which enables our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from the company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating which might be beneficial to them our suppliers’ participation in the scf program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers and therefore we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program in addition we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution as it relates to the program as such amounts due to suppliers that have elected to participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheet and all payment activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flow as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf program and included in accounts payable was approximately 394 million and 460 million respectively the decrease from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 is due to decreases in our underlying supply chain purchases the scf program does not impact our overall liquidity 

we believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs further we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing as well as the availability under committed credit lines provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate

financing activities were a cash outflow of 39 billion in 2020 compared to a cash outflow of 19 billion in 2019 this change is driven by increases in longterm debt repayments of 134 billion a 44 billion change in net cash transfers to discontinued operations an increase in shortterm borrowing repayments of 29 billion and an increase in dividends paid on common stock of 03 billion partially offset by an increase in longterm debt issuances of 192 billion the 2020 debt issuances reflect debt incurred by carrier and otis of approximately 6 billion and 11 billion respectively the net proceeds of these issuances and draws were primarily utilized by utc to extinguish raytheon technologies shortterm and longterm debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the raytheon merger agreement 

at december 31 2020 management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately 50 billion of our common stock under the december 7 2020 share repurchase program under this program shares may be purchased on the open market in privately negotiated transactions under accelerated share repurchase programs and under plans complying with rules 10b51 and 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan we expect to engage in share repurchase activity in 2021 our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law 

2019 compared with 2018  continuing operations 

financing activities was a cash outflow of 19 billion in 2019 compared to a cash inflow of 122 billion in 2018 this change is driven by the absence of 134 billion of longterm debt issuances in the prior year which was primarily utilized to fund the 

table of c ontents 

rockwell acquisition an increase in dividends paid on common stock of 03 billion and an increase in debt repayments of 02 billion partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings of 13 billion and a reduction in common stock repurchases of 02 billion 

our share repurchases were as follows for the years ended december 31 



our board of directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended december 31 



on february 6 2021 the board of directors declared a dividend of 0475 per share payable march 25 2021 to shareowners of record at the close of business on february 26 2021 

we had the following issuances of longterm debt during 2020 and 2018 which is inclusive of issuances made by carrier and otis which were primarily used by the company to extinguish certain raytheon technologies shortterm and longterm debt and therefore were treated as a distribution from discontinued operations within financing activities from continuing operation on our consolidated statement of cash flows 



1 the debt issuances and term loan draws reflect debt incurred by carrier and otis the net proceeds of these issuances were primarily utilized to extinguish raytheon technologies shortterm and longterm debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the raytheon merger agreement 

table of c ontents 

2 the net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used to partially finance the cash consideration portion of the purchase price for rockwell collins and fees expenses and other amounts related to the rockwell acquisition 

3 the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to fund the repayment of commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes 

4 the net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 

we had no issuances of longterm debt during 2019 

we made the following repayments of debt during 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 these notes were assumed in connection with the raytheon merger and subsequently repaid 

2 in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal raytheon technologies recorded debt extinguishment costs of 703 million for the year ended december 31 2020 which are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations as we would not have had to redeem the debt except for the separation transactions no proceeds of the notes issued may 18 2020 were used to fund the may 19 2020 redemption 

3 extinguishment of raytheon technologies shortterm and longterm debt in order to not exceed the maximum net indebtedness required by the raytheon merger agreement 

4 these notes were assumed in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition and subsequently repaid 

financing activities  discontinued operations 

the 12 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to 703 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020 and cash distributions made to carrier and otis of 28 billion which were more than offset by a change in net transfer activity of 45 billion the 16 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to the change in net transfers to continuing operations

critical accounting estimates 

preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

longterm contract accounting we recognize revenue on an overtime basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain longterm aerospace aftermarket contracts we measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion incurred costs represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment we review our estimate at completion eacs on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company’s performance obligations the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis as part of this process management reviews information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matters progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs the risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customerdirected delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries technical requirements customer activity levels such as flight hours or aircraft landings and related variable consideration management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the current economic environment primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs including estimates of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of materials the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractors the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rates and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components among others in particular fixedprice development programs involve significant management judgment as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or incountry industrial participation icip agreements required under certain contracts primarily within our ris and rmd segments these obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature if cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price changes in estimates of net sales cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit are recognized on a cumulative catchup basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations our eac adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions on our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 

net eac adjustments had the following impact on our operating results 



1 amounts reflect a us statutory tax rate of 21 which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustments 

as a result of the raytheon merger raytheon company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date since only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represents the obligation of the company for additional information related to the raytheon merger see “note 2 acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets” within item 8 of this form 10k 

costs incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortized as the oem products are delivered to the customer the estimation of contract margin requires management’s judgment we regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment 

table of c ontents 

income taxes management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements in addition we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation transactions we have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” and “note 13 income taxes” within item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

management has determined that the distributions of carrier and otis on april 3 2020 and certain related internal business separation transactions qualified as taxfree under applicable law in making these determinations we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities tax opinions andor other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment if the completed distributions of carrier or otis in each case or certain internal business separation transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment the company could be subject to significant liabilities and there could be material adverse impacts on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents trademarkstradenames developed technology customer relationships and other intangible assets the fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future aftertax cash flows arising from the followon revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue less a contributory assets charge all of which is discounted to present value the fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach under this method a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate see “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” within item 8 of this form 10k for further details 

we applied these approaches to the valuation of intangibles for the raytheon merger for which the most significant intangible assets identified were customer relationships and tradenames specific to these intangible assets our estimates of market participant future cash flows included forecasted revenue growth rates remaining developmental effort operational performance including company specific synergies program life cycles material and labor pricing and other relevant customer contractual and market factors for the customer relationships where appropriate the net cash flows were probabilityadjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions including cancellation rates related to backlog government demand for solesource and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation in addition the net cash flows were discounted using an appropriate discount rate that requires judgment by management the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the raytheon merger was approximately 191 billion 

also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established otherwise the applicable 

table of c ontents 

portion of the payments are expensed the gross value of these contractual commitments at december 31 2020 was approximately 116 billion of which approximately 33 billion has been paid to date we regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams and the related future cash flows 

goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to its estimated fair values if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value in developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessments that are performed fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates projected operating profit terminal growth rates discount rates and royalty rates such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other things global market conditions 

we considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the covid19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020 requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses collins aerospace and pratt  whitney beginning in the second quarter of 2020 we observed several airline customer bankruptcies delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines fleet retirements and repositioning of oem production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our collins aerospace and pratt  whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours aircraft fleet utilization shop visits and commercial oem deliveries these factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to precovid19 commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations 

in the second quarter of 2020 we evaluated the collins aerospace and pratt  whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six collins aerospace reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows resulting in goodwill impairments of 32 billion collins aerospace discounted future cash flow estimates were developed for three scenarios a base case a downside case and an upside case these scenarios included assumptions regarding future airline flight activity out of warranty hours on original equipment expected repairs upgrades and replacements future oem manufacturing schedules and related environmental assumptions including individuals’ desire to return to normal travel business needs to travel and potential cures or vaccines to prevent or reduce the effects of covid19 these estimates require a significant amount of judgment and are subject to change based upon factors outside our control we weighted the three scenarios as follows 50 for the base case 40 for the downside case and 10 for the upside case and used these weightings as we believed they reflected the risks and opportunities relative to our estimates goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios 

we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020 and therefore did not have a triggering event 

on october 1 2020 we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from july 1 to october 1 to better align with the timing of our annual longterm planning process this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charges we completed our annual impairment testing as of october 1 2020 where we assessed our pratt  whitney ris rmd and one of the collins aerospace reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value step 0 and determined that no further testing was required based on there being no significant changes at ris and rmd since the acquisition of raytheon company and the substantial cushion of fair value over book value at the other reporting units for the remainder of our collins aerospace reporting units we compared the fair value of the reporting units to their respective carrying values step 1 and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary 

based on our annual impairment analysis as of october 1 2020 the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a reporting unit at collins aerospace with a fair value in excess of book value including goodwill of 12 billion or 7 all other factors equal if the discount rate used for the annual impairment analysis increased by 25 basis points the fair value in excess of book value for the collins aerospace reporting unit would have been approximately 03 billion or 2 alternatively all other factors equal if the cash flows were decreased by 10 the fair value for the collins aerospace reporting unit would have decreased by approximately 18 billion material changes in these estimates could occur and result in additional impairments in future periods 

the company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of goodwill including longterm revenue growth projections profitability discount rates recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies volatility in the company’s market capitalization and general 

table of c ontents 

industry market and macroeconomic conditions it is possible that future changes in such circumstances including a more prolonged andor severe covid19 pandemic than originally anticipated or future changes in the variables associated with the judgments assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of our reporting units including the expected long term recovery of airline travel to precovid19 levels would require the company to record a noncash impairment charge 

contingent liabilities our operating units include businesses which sell products and services and conduct operations throughout the world as described in “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k contractual regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation of note the design development production and support of new aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk since the pw1000g geared turbofan engine entered into service in 2016 technical issues have been identified and experienced with the engine which is typical for new engines and new aerospace technologies pratt  whitney has addressed these issues through various improvements and modifications these issues have resulted in financial impacts including increased warranty provisions customer contract settlements and reductions in contract performance estimates additional technical issues either related to this program or other programs may also arise in the normal course which may result in financial impacts that could be material to the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we have significant contracts with the us government subject to government oversight and audit which may require significant adjustment of contract prices we accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of then currently available facts with respect to each matter when no amount within a range of estimates is more likely the minimum is accrued the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

employee benefit plans  we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and prb plans assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators they are evaluated annually at december 31 and when significant events require a midyear remeasurement a change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income expense reported in the consolidated financial statements 

assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement major assumptions include the discount rate and eroa other assumptions include mortality rates demographic assumptions such as retirement age rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure pension and prb liabilities are based on yield curves developed using highquality corporate bonds as well as plan specific cash flows for our significant plans we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows 

the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and prb plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations interest cost and service cost as of december 31 2020 



the discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost a flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income conversely a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income 

the eroa is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations in determining the eroa assumption we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets as well as economic and other indicators of future performance we may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves credit spreads and risk premiums to project longterm prospective returns differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the eroa do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required as the eroa represents the expected average returns over a longterm horizon 

net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the eroa an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the eroa would have increased or decreased our 2020 net periodic benefit income by approximately 116 million 

table of c ontents 

we must apply both financial accounting standards fas requirements under us gaap as described above and us government cost accounting standards cas requirements to calculate pension and prb expense both fas and cas expense use long term assumptions requiring judgement but the cas expense calculation is different from the fas requirements and calculation methodology while the ultimate liability for pension costs under fas and cas is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different our cas pension expense is comprised primarily of cas service cost as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected changes in assumptions or changes in plan provisions cas requires contractors to compare the liability using a discount rate based on the eroa to a liability using a discount rate based on highquality corporate bonds and use the greater of the two liability calculations in developing cas expense additionally unlike fas cas expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded consequently if plans become or cease to be fully funded under cas due to our asset or liability experience our cas expense will change accordingly

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of unconsolidated affiliates and for potential financing requirements of commercial aerospace customers we also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets including indemnities for representations and warranties and environmental health and safety tax and employment matters circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in an underlying transaction eg hazardous waste discoveries etc nonperformance under a contract customer requests for financing or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party 

a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 is as follows 



purchase obligations include amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our longterm purchase agreements we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what is legally enforceable approximately 60 of our purchase obligations disclosed above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the us government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses 

other longterm liabilities primarily include those amounts on our december 31 2020 balance sheet representing performance and operating cost guarantees estimated environmental remediation costs and expected cash funding requirements under employee benefit programs amounts beyond 2023 for cash funding requirements under employee benefits plans are not included the timing of expected cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and is largely based upon historical experience 

the above table also does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 1225 million the timing of which is uncertain except for 36 million that may become payable during 2021 refer to “note 13 income taxes” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations as a result we have established and continually update policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide we believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive posit ion results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla more commonly known as a superfund for a number of sites the nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility in estimating our liability for remediation we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of other potentially responsible parties to fulfill their obligations we also lease certain governmentowned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites as a result we generally do not provide for these costs in our consolidated financing statements 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 835 million and 725 million reserved for environmental remediation respectively cash outflows for environmental remediation were 53 million in 2020 44 million in 2019 and 41 million in 2018 we estimate that ongoing environmental remediation expenditures in each of the next two years will not exceed approximately 100 million 

government matters 

as described above in “critical accounting estimates—contingent liabilities” our contracts with the us government are subject to audits such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations or that certain payments be delayed or withheld we are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the us government with respect to government contract matters see item 3 legal proceedings within part i and “note 13 income taxes” and “note 19 commitments and contingencies” within item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of these and other government matters 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments which are primarily cash debt and derivative instruments to quantify our market risk exposure we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we changed our methodology for quantifying our market risk exposure in the second quarter of 2020 to better align with how we manage our risk exposure refer to “note 1 basis of presentation and summary of accounting principles” “note 10 borrowings and lines of credit” and “note 15 financial instruments” within item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange interest rates and financial instruments 

foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing we actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level more than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was 116 billion and 130 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively  foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates a 10 unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of 08 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments when taken together do not create material market risk 

within our aerospace business our sales are typically denominated in us dollars however for our nonus based entities such as pratt  whitney canada pwc a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies consequently there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as us dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the canadian dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations additionally we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against these other currencies we hedge 

table of c ontents 

a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which us dollars will be converted the majority of this hedging activity occurs at pwc and collins aerospace and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of pratt  whitney at pwc and collins aerospace firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the us dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of us dollar sales over us dollar denominated purchases hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes while the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts changes in the sales profile volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations 

interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixedrate debt obligations a 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate 4 billion impact on the fair value of our fixedrate debt at both december 31 2020 and 2019 the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixedrate debt from time to time we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps currently we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures but may consider such strategies in the future

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2019 annual report in item 1 cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results and in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their products beyond the assistance that may be available in the us customer selections of aircraft engines components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore rpo information may not be indicative of future demand additionally our aerospace businesses competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation honeywell safran helicopter engines and cfm international 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another so urce and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice contracts while approximately 26 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2019 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits for further discussion of risks related to government contracting including ongoing litigation associated with us government audits see item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climaterelated concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our carrier businesses and elevator safety codes are important to otis businesses while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates 

for further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations see item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report 

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel 

copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business including the risks associated with more restrictive trade policies in the us and internationally and other market risks such as the united kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the european union see item 1a “risk factors” and the section titled “business overview in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k and utc’s 2019 annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial businesses which generated approximately 41 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors including trade policies a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and carrier in addition the financial performance of carrier can be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 59 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and rpo levels any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions aviation safety concerns pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery beyond 2020 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice or costshare development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service a reduction in spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing us and global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations should overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and rpo for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout limited or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions trade policies and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 60 percent of our 2019 total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pwc where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar the british pound and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2019 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls taxes or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the us or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products including in connection with the united kingdoms pending withdrawal from the european union could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies such as tariffs could have a negative impact on our results of operations our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa turkey ukraine and countries in the middle east and central asia that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to these and other emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability the imposition of exchange and capital controls and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition of note in 2019 the us government suspended turkey’s participation in the f35 joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russianbuilt s400 air and missile defense system the us has imposed and may impose additional sanctions on turkey as a result of this or other political disputes turkish companies supply components some of which are solesourced to our aerospace businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products depending upon the scope and timing of us sanctions on turkey and potential reciprocal actions if any such sanctions or actions could impact our aerospace businesses’ sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production 

disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including thirdparty manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we may not complete the separation transactions or complete them within the time frame we anticipate the separation transactions may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us andor the independent businesses resulting from the separation andor costs associated with the separation transactions may be higher than anticipated the independent businesses may underperform relative to our expectations we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation transactions 

in november 2018 we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies 1 utc an aerospace company comprised of the collins aerospace systems and pratt  whitney businesses 2 otis and 3 carrier the proposed separations are expected to be effected through spinoffs by utc of otis and carrier that are intended to be taxfree for the company’s shareowners for us federal income tax purposes these separation transactions will be subject to utc’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the raytheon merger agreement discussed below as well as the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions including among others final approval by utc’s board of directors receipt of tax rulings and a tax opinion from external counsel the filing with the sec and effectiveness of form 10 registration statements for otis and carrier and satisfactory completion of financing though utc has agreed pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the raytheon merger agreement that utc will consummate separation transactions the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all additionally the separation transactions are complex in nature and unanticipated developments or changes including changes in law the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected within the anticipated time frame or at all any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits or realize them on a different timeline than expected in addition the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted if any may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions and although we intend for the separation transactions to be taxfree to the company’s shareowners for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify if the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable we the company’s shareowners andor the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant furthermore if the separation transactions are completed we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful 

whether or not the separation transactions are completed our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions including without limitation 

• the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of utc including otis and carrier as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the separation transactions 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships including with customers suppliers employees and other counterparties and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• execution and related risks in connection with utc otis and carrier financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation transactions 

• foreseen and unforeseen dissynergy costs costs of restructuring transactions including taxes and other significant costs and expenses and 

• potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the separation transactions as currently expected within the anticipated time frame or at all 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock in addition if the separation transactions are completed each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs including costs of operating as independent companies that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions 

if the separation transactions are completed utc and the independent businesses’ operational and financial profiles will change and each will be a less diversified company than utc as it exists today 

the separation transactions will result in utc otis and carrier being less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries of note even if the combination with raytheon is completed utc’s businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers namely airbus boeing and the us government as a result each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition the diversification of revenues costs and cash flows will diminish such that each company’s results of operations cash flows working capital effective tax rate and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments pay dividends and service debt may be diminished it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the utc consolidated effective tax rate 

if the separation transactions are completed there may be changes in our shareowner base which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  

investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio if the separation transactions are completed shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the otis and carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries these changes may not match some shareowners’ investment strategies which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions additionally we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be in the aggregate less than equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions 

we may not complete the combination with raytheon or complete the combination within the time frame we anticipate the combined business may underperform relative to our expectations the combination may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits 

the completion of the combination with raytheon is subject to a number of conditions the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all any delay in completing the combination could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefits that utc expects to achieve if the combination is successfully completed within the expected timeframe or could cause utc to realize such benefits on a different timeline than expected in addition the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the combination that are granted if any may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business or may materially delay the completion of the combination moreover the completion of the combination is subject to among other conditions the completion of the spinoffs of otis and carrier which are themselves subject to a number of conditions subject to utc’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the raytheon merger agreement any delay in or prevention of the completion of the spinoffs could delay or prevent the completion of the combination 

the success of the combination will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies from the combination if the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of the combined company’s common stock may decline 

the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

• managing larger combined aerospace systems and defense businesses 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers suppliers and employees and other counterparties as may be impacted by contracts containing consent andor other provisions that may be triggered by the combination and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process 

• the possibility of significant costs involved in connection with completing the merger including costs to achieve expected synergies 

• consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations 

• unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and 

• unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the combination 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions including the acquisition of rockwell collins in november 2018 and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses we expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar antibribery and corruption laws in nonus jurisdictions we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses including the rockwell collins businesses with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements continued supply and services arrangements or potential litigation following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence but do not control the businesses accordingly our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks 

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by our increased indebtedness changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook the expected separation transactions or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition we issued 11 billion of aggregate principal notes and 78 billion of rockwell collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition as expected the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of utcs longterm issuer credit ratings by one notch following the announcement of the expected separation transactions one credit agency placed utcs longterm issuer credit rating on negative outlook 

the expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition may have the effect of among other things 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of costs associated with the separation transactions which will reduce funds we have available 

for other purposes such as acquisitions reinvestment in our businesses dividends and repurchases of our common stock 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk at the time the outstanding debt is refinanced or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates and 

• further downgrades of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs 

we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with operating free cash flow borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed including in connection with the separation transactions and the raytheon merger and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the rockwell collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions we have limited our share repurchasesour ability to repurchase shares is also restricted by the raytheon merger agreement 

the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness 

see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in this form 10k for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing and delivering the pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft the level of orders received for the geared turbofan family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production rampup efforts are delayed if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards andor if we identify or experience issues with inservice engines we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules which could result in material additional costs including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul services on our products hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level 

of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop for example our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products these systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace 

development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns delays andor suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development pending required certifications or after entry into service 

our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if theses targets are not achieved when required 

furthermore our competitors including our customers may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility also exists that our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products 

any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

most of our contracts with the us government are fixed price which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs performance improvements or efficiencies 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default if terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs if terminated for default the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to reprocure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default 

we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated 

like many defense contractors our contracts with the us government are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because for example cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amounts which could if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate andor litigate the company may be and has been required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in the company’s favor any such payments will be returned to the company with interest 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the us department of state the us department of commerce the us department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries 

we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the us department of the treasury certain of our products services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the us munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear or are otherwise subject to the ear in addition us foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals entities or countries as a result our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular enduses or endusers may require authorization any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines seizure of our products adverse publicity restrictions on our ability to export our products or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government moreover any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation environmental product safety anticorruption and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks relate to among other things product safety personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments or other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and in other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs climaterelated events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees thirdparties employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations 

product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services

sales generated by pratt  whitney’s international operations including us export sales were 63 percent and 61 percent of total pratt  whitney net sales in 2018  and 2017  respectively at december 31 2018  pratt  whitney’s rpo was 711 billion including 100 billion of us government contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2017  pratt  

whitneys backlog was 643 billion including 60 billion of us government contracts and subcontracts as noted above in conjunction with our adoption of asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner that is consistent with the definition of rpo in prior years backlog included engine orders from airlines for which the contractual manufacturing purchase orders had not yet been received from the applicable airframe customers effective with the adoption of asc topic 606 we no longer include in backlog airline engine orders for which we have not received the associated firm manufacturing purchase orders the decline in pratt  whitney’s rpo at december 31 2018 as a result of this change has been more than offset by other order activity during the year 

of the total pratt  whitney rpo at december 31 2018  approximately 109 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019  pratt  whitney’s rpo includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 annual report for a description of our revenue recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for longterm contracts and note 3 for further discussion on rpo under asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2018  annual report in item 1 cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results and in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their products beyond the assistance that may be available in the us customer selections of aircraft engines components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand additionally our aerospace businesses competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation honeywell safran helicopter engines and cfm international 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice contracts while approximately 20 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2018 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced or that certain payments should be delayed refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate with the government andor litigate for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climaterelated concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our carrier businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business including the risks associated with more restrictive trade policies in the us and internationally and other market risks such as the uk’s pending withdrawal from the eu see item 1a “risk factors” and the section titled “business overview in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k and utc’s 2018 annual report 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2018  our total number of employees was approximately 240000 which includes approximately 30000 employees added as a result of the acquisition of rockwell collins approximately 63 percent of total employees are based outside the us during 2018 we negotiated 8 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at pratt  whitney’s west palm beach facility in 2019 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which covers certain workers at carrier’s collierville tennessee facility although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in prior years we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2019 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k and under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer 

spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 47  percent of our consolidated sales in 2018  are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors including trade policies a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and carrier in addition the financial performance of carrier can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 53  percent of our consolidated sales in 2018  are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel prices labor issues airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and rpo levels any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the rpo for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2019  changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice or costshare development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing us and global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations should overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and rpo for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout limited or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions trade policies and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 63  percent of our 2018  total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pwc where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar the british pound and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures 

we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls taxes or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the us or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products including in connection with the uks pending withdrawal from the eu could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies such as tariffs could have a negative impact on our results of operations our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa turkey ukraine and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability the imposition of exchange and capital controls and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including thirdparty manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we may not complete the separation transactions or complete them within the time frame we anticipate the separation transactions may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us andor the independent businesses resulting from the separation andor costs associated with the separation transactions may be higher than anticipated the independent businesses may underperform relative to our expectations we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation transactions 

on november 26 2018 we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies 1 utc an aerospace company comprised of the collins aerospace systems and pratt  whitney businesses 2 otis and 3 carrier the proposed separations are expected to be effected through spinoffs by utc of otis and carrier that are intended to be taxfree for the company’s shareowners for us federal income tax purposes these separation transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions including among others final 

approval by utc’s board of directors receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions andor a tax opinion from external counsel as applicable the filing with the sec and effectiveness of form 10 registration statements for otis and carrier and satisfactory completion of financing the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all additionally the separation transactions are complex in nature and unanticipated developments or changes including changes in law the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected within the anticipated time frame or at all any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits or realize them on a different timeline than expected in addition the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted if any may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions and although we intend for the separation transactions to be taxfree to the company’s shareowners for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify if the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable we the company’s shareowners andor the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant furthermore if the separation transactions are completed we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful 

whether or not the separation transactions are completed our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions including without limitation 

 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor the price of our common stock in addition if the separation transactions are completed each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs including costs of operating as independent companies that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions 

if the separation transactions are completed utc and the independent businesses’ operational and financial profiles will change and each will be a smaller less diversified company than utc as it exists today 

the separation transactions will result in utc otis and carrier being smaller less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries of note utc’s businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers namely airbus boeing and the us government   as a result each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations in addition the diversification of revenues costs and cash flows will diminish such that each company’s results of operations cash flows working capital effective tax rate and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments pay dividends and service debt may be diminished it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the utc consolidated effective tax rate 

if the separation transactions are completed there may be changes in our shareowner base which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  

investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio if the separation transactions are completed shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry 

and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the otis and carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries these changes may not match some shareowners’ investment strategies which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions additionally we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be in the aggregate less than equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses we expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar antibribery and corruption laws in nonus jurisdictions we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence but do not control the businesses accordingly our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks   

the rockwell collins acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies 

the ultimate success of the rockwell collins acquisition will depend in part on utc’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and rockwell collins and realize the anticipated benefits including revenue and cost synergies innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies from the acquisition if utc is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of utc’s common stock may decline as a result 

       the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 



 our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by our increased indebtedness changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook the expected separation transactions or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition we issued 11 billion of aggregate principal notes and 78 billion of rockwell collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition as expected the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of utcs longterm issuer credit ratings by one notch following the announcement of the expected separation transactions one credit agency placed utcs longterm issuer credit rating on negative outlook 

the expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition may have the effect of among other things 

 we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the rockwell collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions we have limited our share repurchases 

the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing and delivering the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft which entered into service in january 2016 the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production rampup efforts are delayed if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards andor if we identify or experience issues with inservice engines we may not meet customers’ production schedules which could result in material additional costs including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul services on our products hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop for example our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace 

development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications 

our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 

furthermore our competitors including our customers may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products 

any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

most of our contracts with the us government are fixed price which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs performance improvements or efficiencies 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default if terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs if terminated for default the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to reprocure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default 

we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audit like many defense contractors we have received audit reports recommending that certain contract prices should be reduced or that certain payments should be delayed refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices was incomplete or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts of which those that allege noncompliance with the cost accounting practices associated with our military engine business could if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the us department of state the us department of commerce the us department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries 

we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the us department of the treasury certain of our products services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the us munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear or are otherwise subject to the ear in addition us foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals entities or countries as a result our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular enduses or endusers may require authorization any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines seizure of our products adverse publicity restrictions on our ability to export our products or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government moreover any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation environmental product safety and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks relate to among other things product safety personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations 

including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs climaterelated events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries’ current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees thirdparties employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations 

product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents us companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery and corruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which increase our costs may affect our competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty

funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018  annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any future restructuring activities expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or otherwise harm our business or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyberattacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology “it” infrastructure which could result from among other causes cyberattacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature cyberbased risks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties both on premises and in the cloud attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information classified information or information relating to our employees customers and other third parties cyberbased risks could also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor availability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties impact business operations result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corrupt our data or that of third parties we have experienced cyberbased attacks and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capabilities and to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services and operations from potential cyberattacks however given the unpredictability nature and scope of cyberattacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our or thirdparty systems networks or products financial losses from remedial actions loss of business potential liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition due to the evolving nature of such risks the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success

utcs pending acquisition of rockwell collins 

on september 4 2017 we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement with rockwell collins inc rockwell collins under which we agreed to acquire rockwell collins under the terms of the merger agreement each rockwell collins shareowner will receive 9333 per share in cash and a fraction of a share of utc common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing 4667 by the average of the volumeweighted average price per share of utc common stock on the nyse on each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately prior to the closing date the “utc stock price” subject to adjustment based on a twoway collar mechanism as described below the “stock consideration” the cash and utc stock payable in exchange for each such share of rockwell collins common stock are collectively the “merger consideration” the fraction of a share of utc common stock into which each such share of rockwell collins common stock will be converted is the “exchange ratio” the exchange ratio will be determined based upon the utc stock price if the utc stock price is greater than 10701 but less than 12437 the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of i 4667 divided by ii the utc stock price which in each case will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to 4667 if the utc stock price is less than or equal to 10701 or greater than or equal to 12437 then a twoway collar mechanism will apply pursuant to which x if the utc stock price is greater than or equal to 12437 the exchange ratio will be fixed at 037525 and the value of the stock consideration will be greater than 4667 and y if the utc stock price is less than or equal to 10701 the exchange ratio will be fixed at 043613 and the value of the stock consideration will be less than 4667 on january 11 2018 the merger was approved by rockwell collins shareowners we currently expect that the merger will be completed in the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals 

we anticipate that approximately 15 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration we expect to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration through debt issuances and cash on hand additionally we have entered into a 65 billion 364day unsecured bridge loan credit agreement that would be funded only to the extent certain anticipated debt issuances are not completed prior to the completion of the merger we expect to assume approximately 7 billion of rockwell collins outstanding debt upon completion of the merger to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the pending acquisition we have among other things suspended share repurchases excluding activity relating to our employee savings plans as we continue to assess the impacts of the us tax reform enacted on december 22 2017 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja future opportunities for 

repatriation of our nonus earnings and accelerated deleveraging we may consider in addition to investments in our operations limited additional share repurchases to offset the effects of dilution related to our stockbased compensation programs  see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2017  annual report in item 1 cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results and in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products beyond the assistance that may be available in the us customer selections of aircraft engines components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand additionally our aerospace businesses competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017  annual report pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation honeywell safran helicopter engines and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 24 billion or 40 percent of total sales in 2017 and 23 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2016 and 2015 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers costs incurred under this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 15 billion in 2017 as compared to 14 billion in 2016 and 15 billion in 2015 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments total contract research and development costs of 15 billion 14 billion and 16 billion were expensed through cost of products sold in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 18 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2017 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced or that certain payments should be delayed refunded 

or withheld to comply with various government regulations including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate with the government andor litigate for further discussion of risks related to government contracting item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017  annual report 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017  annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2017 our total number of employees was approximately 205000 of which approximately 67 percent represents employees based outside the us during 2017 we negotiated or concluded 12 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at otis across the us in 2018 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which covers certain workers at utc aerospace systems in rockford illinois although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2018 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k and under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017  annual report

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 50  percent of our consolidated sales in 2017  are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 50  percent of our consolidated sales in 2017  are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and backlog levels any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2018  changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing us and global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations should overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout limited or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 61  percent of our 2017  total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pwc where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017  annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls punitive taxes or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the us or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies such as tariffs could have a negative impact on our results of operations our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa ukraine and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including thirdparty contract manufacturing and logistics and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses including the pending acquisition of rockwell collins and expect to continue to do so in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other antibribery and corruption laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition 

accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions including the rockwell collins transaction and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things we also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence but do not control the businesses accordingly our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks    

we may not complete the acquisition of rockwell collins or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate the acquired business may underperform relative to our expectations the acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies 

the completion of the acquisition of rockwell collins is subject to a number of conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all any delay in completing the acquisition could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefits or realize them on a different timeline than expected that utc expects to achieve if the acquisition is successfully completed within the expected time frame in addition the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted if any may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business or may materially delay the completion of the acquisition 

the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend in part on utc’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of utc and rockwell collins and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies from the acquisition if utc is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of utc’s common stock may decline 

       the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation 

 our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity in connection with the rockwell collins merger we anticipate that approximately 15 billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration we expect to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration through debt issuances and cash on hand we expect to assume approximately 7 billion of rockwell collins outstanding debt upon completion of the merger the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the merger may have the effect of among other things 



 we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings in particular following the announcement of the proposed rockwell collins acquisition the credit rating agencies announced that they were reviewing our credit ratings for possible downgrades 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the pending rockwell collins acquisition we have among other things suspended share repurchases excluding activity relating to our employee savings plans as we continue to assess the impacts of the tcja future opportunities for repatriation of our nonus earnings and accelerated deleveraging we may consider in addition to investments in our operations limited additional share repurchases to offset the effects of dilution related to our stockbased compensation programs  see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2017 annual report 

the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing and delivering the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft which entered into service in january 2016 the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production rampup efforts are delayed if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards andor if we identify or experience issues with inservice engines we may not meet customers’ production schedules which could result in material additional costs including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability 

of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul services on our products hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products in the future we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

most of our government contracts are fixedprice contracts while fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements cost reductions and efficiencies they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations or that certain payments be delayed or withheld some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be false 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control and sanctions regulations and may require authorization from the us department of state the us department of commerce the us department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries 

we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the us department of the treasury certain of our products services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the us munitions list of the itar and the commerce control list of the ear or are otherwise subject to the ear in addition us foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals entities or countries as a result our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular enduses or endusers may require authorization any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines seizure of our products adverse publicity restrictions on our ability to export our products or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government moreover any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation environmental product safety and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks relate to among other things product safety personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries’ current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations 

product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents us companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery and corruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or 

enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2016  annual report in item 1 cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results and in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products beyond the assistance that may be available in the us and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these engines for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation honeywell turbomeca and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 23 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2016 and 2015 and 25 billion or 43 percent of total sales in 2014 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers costs incurred under this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 14 billion in 2016 as compared to 15 billion in 2015 and 20 billion in 2014 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments total contract research and development costs of 14 billion 16 billion and 20 billion were expensed through cost of products sold in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 16 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2016 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced or that certain payments should be delayed or withheld to comply with various government regulations including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and in some cases continue to negotiate with the government andor litigate for further discussion of risks related to government contracting item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates 

for further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations see item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report 

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2016 our total number of employees was approximately 202000 of which approximately 68 percent represents employees based outside the us during 2016 we negotiated or concluded   eight domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at pratt  whitney’s facilities in east hartford and middletown connecticut in 2017 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which covers certain workers at otis across the us although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2017 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k and under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits trade policies political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 50  percent of our consolidated sales in 2016  are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 50  percent of our consolidated sales in 2016  are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and backlog levels any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2017  changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket 

service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing us and global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations us government deficit reduction measures congressional and executive branch disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses should these factors continue and overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout limited or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 61  percent of our 2016  total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pw canada where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls punitive taxes or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the us or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or 

more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including third party contract manufacturing and logistics and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to continue to do so in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or other antibribery and corruption laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

 we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater 

difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash 

the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally repurchases of our shares will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently producing the purepower® pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft which entered into service in january 2016 the level of orders received for the purepower® family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if our production rampup efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards we may not meet customers’ production schedules which could result in material additional costs including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in 

what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

most of our government contracts are fixedprice contracts while fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements cost reductions and efficiencies they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations or that certain payments be delayed or withheld some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require authorization from the us department of state the us department of commerce or  the us department of the treasury or regulatory agencies of other countries 

as an exporter we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the us export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar   and the commerce control list of the ear or represent socalled dual use items governed by the ear as a result these products may   require   prior authorization to be exported to certain jurisdictions any failures by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines investigations adverse publicity or restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties any changes in export or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation environmental product safety and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product safety personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries’ current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services for a description of current material legal proceedings see legal proceedings in in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 annual report 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other antibribery and corruption laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery and corruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our results 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016  annual report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include political responses to such actions unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyberbased and business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third party information technology “it” infrastructure which could result from among other causes attacks on or failures of such infrastructure compromises to its physical security as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature cyberbased risks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to both attacks on our it infrastructure and attacks on the it infrastructure of third parties both on premises and in the cloud in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information classified information or information relating to our employees customers and other third parties cyberbased risks could also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products facilities or infrastructure such attacks could result in disruptions to systems our own or those of third parties unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our own or that of third parties we have experienced cyberbased attacks and may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services and operations from these potential attacks however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such attacks or other disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our or third party systems networks or products financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us in addition we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services we may also be subject to disruptions losses

dojsec investigations 

as previously disclosed in december 2013 and january 2014 utc made voluntary disclosures to the united states department of justice doj the securities and exchange commission sec division of enforcement and the united kingdom’s serious fraud office to report the status of its internal investigation regarding a nonemployee sales representative retained by united technologies international operations inc utio and iae for the sale of pratt  whitney and iae engines and aftermarket services respectively in china on april 7 2014 the sec notified utc that it was conducting a formal investigation and issued a subpoena to utc the doj and sec also continue to request information and the sec issued a second subpoena on march 9 2015 seeking documents related to internal allegations of alleged violations of antibribery laws from utc’s aerospace and commercial businesses including but not limited to otis businesses in china utc continues to cooperate fully with the investigations and respond to requests for documents and information because the investigations are ongoing we cannot predict the outcome or the consequences thereof at this time 

at the outset of the internal investigation utio and iae suspended all commission payments to the sales representative and utio and iae have not resumed making any payments this led to two claims by the sales representative for unpaid commissions a civil lawsuit filed against utio and utc and an arbitration claim against iae in december 2014 the sales representative voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit and agreed to withdraw the arbitration claim each without prejudice to allow 

the sales representative to reassert the claims but only on or after january 1 2016 we anticipate that we would contest any future claim and do not believe that the resolution of a future lawsuit or arbitration by the sales representative would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our 2015  annual report in item 1 cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results and in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products beyond the assistance that may be available in the us and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these engines for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015  annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell turbomeca and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 23 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2015 as compared with 25 billion or 43 percent of total sales in 2014 and 23 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2013 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers costs incurred under this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 15 billion in 2015 as compared to 20 billion in 2014 and 18 billion in 2013 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments total contract research and development costs of 16 billion 20 billion and 18 billion were expensed through cost of products sold in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 15 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2015 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced or that certain payments should be delayed or withheld to comply with various government regulations including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a risk factors and item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015  annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015  annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates these measures include us economic sanctions targeting iran 

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2015 our total number of employees was approximately 197000 approximately 68 percent of which represents employees based outside the us during 2015 we negotiated or concluded 12 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at utc climate controls  securitys carrier facility in collierville tennessee in 2016 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which covers certain workers at pratt  whitneys connecticut locations although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2016 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k and under

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 52  percent of our consolidated sales in 2015  are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 48 percent of our consolidated sales in 2015  are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown significant improvement uncertainty continues to exist in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and backlog levels any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2016  changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have 

a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations us government deficit reduction measures congressional disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses should these factors continue and overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts such us government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from new us government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations or that certain payments be delayed or withheld some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 62  percent of our 2015  total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pw canada where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015  annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for 

example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including third party contract manufacturing and logistics and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to do so in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

 we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash 

the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally repurchases of our shares will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently developing the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft which entered into service in january 2016 the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if our production rampup efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards we may not meet customers’ production schedules which could result in material additional costs including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external 

performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the us department of state the us department of commerce or the us department of the treasury 

as an exporter we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the us export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls ddtc and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar or represent socalled dual use items governed by the ear as a result these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines investigations adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and alleged property damages personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries’ current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions including cancers incurred by employees former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products also can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services for a description of current material legal proceedings see legal proceedings in in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 annual report

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to 

generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2014  annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these engines for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014  annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell turbomeca and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 26 billion or 40 percent of total sales in 2014 as compared with 25 billion or 40 percent of total sales in 2013 and 24 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2012 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 23 billion in 2014 as compared to 22 billion in 2013 and 17 billion in 2012 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments of the total contract research and development costs 24 billion 21 billion and 17 billion were expensed in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another 

source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 19 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2014 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government that recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014  annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014  annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates these measures include us economic sanctions targeting iran

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 45  percent of our consolidated sales in 2014  are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 55 percent of our consolidated sales in 2014  are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown significant improvement uncertainty continues to exist in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and backlog levels any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2015  changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have 

a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations us government deficit reduction measures congressional disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses should these factors continue and overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages andor bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of us government contracts the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 61  percent of our 2014  total segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations especially the commercial businesses and pw canada where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014  annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency 

political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to do so in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences our ability to access debt may be affected by changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

 13 

 we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services of particular note pratt  whitney is currently developing the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the a320neo family of aircraft which is scheduled to enter into service in 2015 the level of orders received for the purepower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if our production rampup efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards we may not meet customers’ production schedules which could result in material additional costs including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the us department of state the us department of commerce or the us department of the treasury 

as an exporter we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the us export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state 

directorate of defense trade controls ddtc and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar or represent socalled “dual use” items governed by the ear as a result these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines investigations adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to product safety litigation environmental and other legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product safety personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs product recalls and product liability claims including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products can result in significant costs including fines as well as negative publicity management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services for a description of current legal proceedings see legal proceedings in in this form 10k 

in addition the fcpa and other antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and foreign and other antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

see notes 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2014  annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on our information technology infrastructure and other business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises cybersecurity threats in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to both attacks to our it infrastructure and attacks to the it infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential classified or otherwise proprietary information of us andor our employees customers and other third parties such cybersecurity attacks could result in disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our own or that of third parties we have experienced cybersecurity attacks and may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us in addition we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures as described above any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

export violations 

a significant portion of our activities are subject to export control regulation by the us department of state state department under the us arms export control act aeca and international traffic in arms regulations itar from time to time we identify investigate remediate and voluntarily disclose to the office of defense trade controls compliance dtcc potential violations of the aeca and itar dtcc administers the state department’s authority under the aeca and 

itar to impose civil penalties and other administrative sanctions for violations including debarment from engaging in the export of defense articles or defense services most of our voluntary disclosures are resolved without the imposition of penalties or other sanctions however as previously disclosed in november 2011 dtcc informed us that it was reviewing certain of our voluntary disclosures filed since 2005 and believed some of these disclosures could constitute deficiencies warranting penalties and sanctions in connection with the above on june 28 2012 we entered into a consent agreement ca with dtcc to resolve a proposed charging letter that references approximately 45 of our previous disclosures the ca has a fouryear term and provides that we will 1 pay a civil penalty of 55 million up to 20 million of which can be suspended based on qualifying compliance investments made by us prior to or during the term of the ca 2 appoint subject to dtcc approval an outside special compliance official sco to oversee our compliance with the ca and the aeca and itar 3 continue and undertake additional remedial actions to strengthen aeca and itar compliance with emphasis on human resources and organization training automation and security of electronic data and 4 sponsor two companywide outside compliance audits during the term of the ca 

the voluntary disclosures addressed in the ca include disclosures made in 2006 and 2007 regarding the export by legacy hamilton sundstrand to pwc of certain modifications to dualuse electronic engine control software and the reexport by pwc of those software modifications and subsequent pwcdeveloped modifications to china during the period 20022004 for use in the development of the z10 chinese military helicopter as previously disclosed the doj separately conducted a criminal investigation of the matters addressed in these disclosures as well as the accuracy adequacy and timeliness of the disclosures we cooperated with the doj’s investigation on june 28 2012 the us attorney for the district of connecticut filed a threecount criminal information alleging 1 that in 20022003 pwc caused legacy hamilton sundstrand to export itarcontrolled software modifications to canada and reexported them to china without the required license 2 that in 2006 pwc legacy hamilton sundstrand and utc made false statements in disclosures to dtcc regarding these aeca and itar violations and 3 that pwc and legacy hamilton sundstrand violated a separate provision of the aeca and itar by failing timely to notify dtcc of the unlicensed software shipments to china pwc pleaded guilty to violating the aeca and the itar and making false statements as alleged and was sentenced to probation and to pay fines and forfeitures totaling 69 million pwc legacy hamilton sundstrand and utc the utc entities entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa regarding the remaining offenses charged with respect to each utc entity the dpa has a twoyear term and provides that the utc entities will 1 pay an additional penalty of 138 million 2 appoint subject to doj approval an independent monitor who may be the same person as the sco appointed under the ca to oversee compliance with the dpa 3 provide annual senior officer certifications that all known violations of the aeca and itar export administration regulations and sanctions regimes implemented under the international emergency economic powers act occurring after the execution date of the dpa have been reported by utc its subsidiaries and its majorityowned or controlled affiliates to the appropriate officials of the us government 4 cooperate with law enforcement in specified areas and 5 implement specified compliance training initiatives on july 9 2014 the us attorney for the district of connecticut having determined that the utc entities were in full compliance with all of their obligations under the dpa moved to dismiss with prejudice the remaining offenses charged with respect to each utc entity on july 14 2014 the united states district court for the district of connecticut granted this motion and the dpa is now concluded 

we believe the previously disclosed potential liability recognized as of march 31 2012 of 55 million will be sufficient to discharge all amounts due under the ca and dpa 

on june 28 2012 by reason of pwc’s guilty plea to a criminal violation of the aeca and the itar dtcc imposed a partial statutory debarment on pwc with respect to obtaining new or renewed itar license privileges the debarment does not affect existing itar licensesauthorities nor does it extend to programs supporting 1 the us government 2 nato allies or 3 “major nonnato allies” as defined in the itar pwc may seek “transaction exception” approvals on a casebycase basis for new or renewed itar licensing in other cases during the period of debarment pwc may apply for full reinstatement of itar privileges after one year while pwc is currently eligible to apply for reinstatement to date pwc has not applied for reinstatement on december 20 2012 utc entered into an administrative agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official where army officials determined that the utc entities are presently responsible and that further action is not necessary to protect the us government’s interests pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation and the national defense appropriations act the agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official completes the department of defense review of the utc entities’ present responsibility under the federal acquisition regulation and pwc’s eligibility to receive funds appropriated for fiscal year 2012 under the national defense appropriations act

utc fire  security americas corporation inc utcfs has been named as a defendant in numerous putative class actions that were filed on behalf of purported classes of persons who allege that thirdparty entities placed “robocalls” andor placed calls to numbers listed on the “do not call registry” on behalf of utcfs in contravention of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa in each putative class action suit plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and monetary damages each violation under the tcpa provides for 500 in statutory damages or up to 1500 for any willful violation we assert that the thirdparty entities that initiated the calls were not acting on our behalf in making any such calls we believe that utcfs has meritorious defenses to these claims we are presently unable to estimate the damages for which utcfs could be liable in the event plaintiffs prevail in one or more of these cases 

dojsec investigations 

as previously disclosed in december 2013 and january 2014 utc made voluntary disclosures to the united states department of justice doj the securities and exchange commission sec division of enforcement and the united kingdom’s serious fraud office to report the status of its internal investigation regarding a nonemployee sales representative retained by united technologies international operations inc utio and iae for the sale of pratt  whitney and iae engines and aftermarket services respectively in china on april 7 2014 the sec notified utc that it was conducting a formal investigation and issued a subpoena to utc utc recently extended its tolling agreement with the sec and continues to cooperate fully with the investigations relating to its aerospace and commercial businesses in china because the investigations are ongoing we cannot predict the outcome or the consequences thereof at this time 

at the outset of the internal investigation utio and iae suspended all commission payments to the sales representative and utio and iae have not resumed making any payments this led to two claims by the sales representative for unpaid commissions a civil lawsuit filed against utio and utc and an arbitration claim against iae in december 2014 the sales representative voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit and agreed to withdraw the arbitration claim each without prejudice to allow the sales representative to reassert the claims but only on or after january 1 2016 we anticipate that we would contest any future claim and do not believe that the resolution of a future lawsuit or arbitration by the sales representative would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

sikorsky government contract claim 

as previously disclosed on october 14 2014 the united states government filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin alleging that sikorsky and two of its whollyowned subsidiaries derco aerospace derco and sikorsky support services inc sssi violated the false claims act in connection with a contract that the us navy awarded to sssi in june 2006 to support the navy’s t34 and t44 fixedwing turboprop training aircraft sssi subcontracted with derco primarily to procure and manage the spare parts for the training aircraft the government alleges that sssi overbilled the navy on the contract because derco added profit and overhead costs to the price of the spare parts that derco procured and then sold to sssi the government also claims that sssi submitted false certificates of final indirect costs in the years 2006 through 2012 we believe that derco was lawfully permitted to add profit and overhead to the cost of the parts and maintain that sssi did not submit any false certificates we also believe that we have other substantial legal and factual defenses to the government’s claims 

the government’s complaint asserts numerous claims for violations of the false claims act for breach of contract and for unjust enrichment but it does not specify the amount of damages sought sikorsky believes that the government will seek damages in excess of 50 million plus treble damages and statutory penalties all totaling in excess of 170 million although we continue to evaluate liability and exposure we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss if contrary to our expectations the government prevails in this matter and proves damages in a material amount the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages would be paid

the development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities pratt  whitney is under contract with the us air force to develop the f135 engine a derivative of pratt  whitney’s f119 engine to power the singleengine f35 lightning ii aircraft being developed by lockheed martin pratt  whitney achieved initial service release for the conventional takeoff and landingcarrier variant and short takeoff and vertical landing variant of the f135 engine in february 2010 and january 2011 respectively these propulsion system configurations are now certified for production and cleared for flight on the lockheed martin f35b stealth fighter jet and are in use by the us air force at eglin air force base and by the us marine corps at marine corps air station yuma in addition pratt  whitney is currently developing technology including the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine intended to enable it to power both currentlyproposed and future aircraft the purepower pw1000g engine targets a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels with lower environmental emissions and operating costs than current production engines in december 2010 airbus announced that it will offer a version of the purepower pw1000g engine as a new engine option to power its a320neo family of aircraft scheduled to enter into service in 2015 in november 2012 pratt  whitney commenced testing on this new engine the pw1100gjm being developed as part of a collaboration with mtu and jaec additionally purepower pw1000g engine models have been selected by bombardier to power the new cseries passenger aircraft by mitsubishi aircraft corporation to power the new mitsubishi regional jet and by irkut corporation of russia to power the proposed new irkut mc21 passenger aircraft the cseries passenger aircraft engine received its civil aviation certificate from transport canada in february 2013 had its first flight on the cseries aircraft in september 2013 and is scheduled to enter into service in 2015 the mitsubishi regional jet and the irkut mc21 are scheduled to enter into service in 2017 further on january 8 2013 embraer announced the selection of the purepower engine to exclusively power the next generation of embraer’s ejet family of aircraft scheduled to enter service in 2018 the success of these aircraft and the purepower pw1000g family of engines is dependent upon many factors including technological accomplishments aircraft demand and regulatory approval based on these factors as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions additional investment in the purepower program may be required pwc has developed or is developing the pw210 engine family for helicopters manufactured by sikorsky agustawestland and airbus helicopters and is developing the purepower pw800 engine for the new generation of longrange and heavy business jets pratt  whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion 

pratt  whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers airlines and other aircraft operators aircraft leasing companies and the us and foreign governments pratt  whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and marketdriven safety and performance standards the frequently changing nature of these standards along with the long duration of aircraft engine development production and support programs creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability the vast majority of sales are made directly to the end customer and to a limited extent through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives sales to airbus pratt  whitney’s largest nongovernmental customer by sales were 35 percent and 25 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers sales to the us government were 25 percent and 27 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

sales generated by pratt  whitney’s international operations including us export sales were 64 percent and 57 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively at december 31 2013 pratt  whitney’s backlog was 385 billion including 36 billion of us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2012 these amounts were 436 billion and 43 billion respectively of the total pratt  whitney backlog at december 31 2013 approximately 88 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2014 pratt  whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales pratt  whitney’s backlog excludes orders for new commercial engines that have not yet achieved full aviation authority certification see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for a description of our accounting for longterm contracts

other 

on march 14 2012 the board of directors of the company approved a plan for the divestiture of a number of our noncore businesses cash generated from these divestitures was used to repay the debt incurred to finance the goodrich acquisition these noncore businesses include the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses which manufacture air compressors metering pumps and heavy duty process pumps for industries involved with chemical and hydrocarbon processing oil and gas production water and wastewater treatment and construction clipper windpower plc clipper a californiabased wind turbine manufacturer pratt  whitney rocketdyne a leader in the design development and manufacture of sophisticated space propulsion systems for military and commercial applications and pratt  whitney power systems which sells aeroderivative engines for industrial applications the divestitures of clipper and the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses were completed in 2012 the divestitures of pratt  whitney power systems and substantially all of the operations of pratt  whitney rocketdyne were completed in the second quarter of 2013 

on june 29 2012 management of the company approved a plan for the divestiture of utc power a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary and transportation applications which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 

the results of operations for the remaining divestitures of pratt  whitney rocketdyne and utc power including the net gainslosses expected on disposition and the related cash flows which result from these noncore businesses have been reclassified to “discontinued operations” in our consolidated statement of operations and our consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods presented the sale of pratt  whitney power systems was not reclassified to “discontinued operations” due to our level of continuing involvement in supplying certain engineering and development services under agreements with the divested business post disposition 

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2013 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees primarily related to pratt  whitney see notes 5 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell turbomeca and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as 

incurred were 25 billion or 40 percent of total sales in 2013 as compared with 24 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2012 and 20 billion or 35 percent of total sales in 2011 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 22 billion in 2013 as compared to 17 billion in 2012 and 15 billion in 2011 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments of the total contract research and development costs 21 billion 17 billion and 14 billion were expensed in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 21 billion or 33 percent of our total sales for 2013 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government that recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates these measures include us economic sanctions targeting iran 

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our businesses while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio our efforts may not be sufficient see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2013 our total number of employees was approximately 212000 approximately 64 percent of which represents employees based outside the us during 2013 we negotiated or concluded 11 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at sikorskys manufacturing facilities in connecticut and florida in 2014 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which covers certain workers at utc climate controls  securitys carrier facility in indianapolis although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2014 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits political conditions actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales in 2013 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs global credit market conditions and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 53 percent of our consolidated sales in 2013 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement since 2011 uncertainty continues to exist in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation bankruptcies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability cost reduction efforts and backlog levels any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2014 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on 

our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations us government deficit reduction measures the us government shutdown in 2013 congressional disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses should these factors continue and overall us government defense spending decline it could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military businesses one or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phasedout or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages andor bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of us government contracts the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 62 percent of our 2013 consolidated sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india mexico russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as 

our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers supplier capacity constraints contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to do so in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition the success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the pending transactions the timing of consummation of these pending transactions and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

our debt has increased as a result of the goodrich acquisition our ability to access debt is subject to increased costs and may be affected by changes in the global capital market our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity we incurred substantial additional debt as a result of the goodrich acquisition our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 

• exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to 

become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the us department of state the us department of commerce or the us department of the treasury 

as an exporter we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the us export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls ddtc and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar or represent socalled “dual use” items governed by the ear as a result these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines investigations adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties as previously disclosed on june 28 2012 we entered into a consent agreement with the ddtc and a deferred prosecution agreement with the us department of justice regarding separate but related export licensing compliance violations both of which impose significant continuing obligations in connection with the foregoing we entered into an administrative agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official in which army officials determined that we are presently responsible and that further action is not necessary pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation and national defense appropriations act any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation environmental and other legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product liability personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs for a description of current legal proceedings see legal proceedings in in this form 10k 

in addition the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the fcpa or similar laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and 

liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

 see notes 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2013 annual report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our own or that of third parties we have experienced cybersecurity attacks and may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us in addition we may be the target of competitor or other third party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various

 item 3 legal proceedings 

export violations 

a significant portion of our activities are subject to export control regulation by the us department of state state department under the us arms export control act aeca and international traffic in arms regulations itar from time to time we identify investigate remediate and voluntarily disclose to the defense trade controls compliance dtcc potential violations of the aeca and itar dtcc administers the state department’s authority under the aeca and itar to impose civil penalties and other administrative sanctions for violations including debarment from engaging in the export of defense articles or defense services most of our voluntary disclosures are resolved without the imposition of penalties or other sanctions however as previously disclosed in november 2011 dtcc informed us that it was reviewing certain of our voluntary disclosures filed since 2005 and believed some of these disclosures could constitute deficiencies warranting penalties and sanctions in connection with the above on june 28 2012 we entered into a consent agreement ca with dtcc to resolve a proposed charging letter that references approximately 45 of our previous disclosures the ca has a fouryear term and provides that we will 1 pay a civil penalty of 55 million up to 20 million of which can be suspended based on qualifying compliance investments made by us prior to or during the term of the ca 2 appoint subject to dtcc approval an outside special compliance official sco to oversee our compliance with the ca and the aeca and itar 3 continue and undertake additional remedial actions to strengthen aeca and itar compliance with emphasis on human resources and organization training automation and security of electronic data and 4 sponsor two companywide outside compliance audits during the term of the ca 

the voluntary disclosures addressed in the ca include disclosures made in 2006 and 2007 regarding the export by legacy hamilton sundstrand to pwc of certain modifications to dualuse electronic engine control software and the reexport by pwc of those software modifications and subsequent pwcdeveloped modifications to china during the period 20022004 for use in the development of the z10 chinese military helicopter as previously disclosed the doj separately conducted a criminal investigation of the matters addressed in these disclosures as well as the accuracy adequacy and timeliness of the disclosures we cooperated with the doj’s investigation on june 28 2012 the us attorney for the district of connecticut filed a threecount criminal information alleging 1 that in 20022003 pwc caused legacy hamilton sundstrand to export itarcontrolled software modifications to canada and reexported them to china without the required license 2 that in 2006 pwc legacy hamilton sundstrand and utc made false statements in disclosures to dtcc regarding these aeca and itar violations and 3 that pwc and legacy hamilton sundstrand violated a separate provision of the aeca and itar by failing timely to notify dtcc of the unlicensed software shipments to china pwc pleaded guilty to violating the aeca and the itar and making false statements as alleged and was sentenced to probation and to pay fines and forfeitures totaling 69 million pwc legacy hamilton sundstrand and utc the utc entities entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa regarding the remaining offenses charged with respect to each utc entity the dpa has a twoyear term and provides that the utc entities will 1 pay an additional penalty of 138 million 2 appoint subject to doj approval an independent monitor who may be the same person as the sco appointed under the ca to oversee compliance with the dpa 3 provide annual senior officer certifications that all known violations of the aeca and itar export administration regulations and sanctions regimes implemented under the international emergency economic powers act occurring after the execution date of the dpa have been reported by utc its subsidiaries and its majorityowned or controlled affiliates to the appropriate officials of the us government 4 cooperate with law enforcement in specified areas and 5 implement specified compliance training initiatives 

we believe the previously disclosed potential liability recognized as of march 31 2012 of 55 million will be sufficient to discharge all amounts due under the ca and dpa 

on june 28 2012 by reason of pwc’s guilty plea to a criminal violation of the aeca and the itar dtcc imposed a partial statutory debarment on pwc with respect to obtaining new or renewed itar license privileges the debarment does not affect existing itar licensesauthorities nor does it extend to programs supporting 1 the us government 2 nato allies or 3 “major nonnato allies” as defined in the itar pwc may seek “transaction exception” approvals on a casebycase basis for new or renewed itar licensing in other cases during the period of debarment pwc may apply for full reinstatement of itar privileges after one year while pwc is currently eligible to apply for reinstatement to date pwc has not applied for reinstatement on december 20 2012 utc entered into an administrative agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official where army officials determined that the utc entities are presently responsible and that further action is not necessary to protect the us government’s interests pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation and the national defense appropriations act the agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official completes the department of defense review of the utc entities’ present responsibility under the federal acquisition regulation and pwc’s eligibility to receive funds appropriated for fiscal year 2012 under the national defense appropriations act

on october 31 2012 a shareholder filed a stockholder derivative action in the delaware court of chancery against all of utcs current directors the complaint centered on the june 28 2012 guilty plea of pwc to violations of the us arms export control act and international traffic in arms regulations and making false statements in connection with its illegal export to china of usorigin military software used in the development of a chinese military attack helicopter the z10 the complaint alleged among other things that utcs directors had breached their fiduciary duties owed to utc and its shareholders and had committed “corporate waste” by failing to oversee adequately utcs export control compliance the complaint also alleged that utcs directors “failed to ensure” that there were adequate internal controls to assure compliance the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against utc including an order removing and replacing the directors and asserted a claim for unspecified money damages against only the directors on june 18 2013 the chancery court issued an order granting the directors motion to dismiss the case with prejudice the shareholder appealed that decision on december 19 2013 the delaware supreme court affirmed the chancery courts order dismissing the case 

asbestos litigation 

like many other industrial companies in recent years we or our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises while we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currentlymanufactured products certain of our historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos a substantial majority of these asbestosrelated claims have been covered by our insurance or other forms of indemnity or have been dismissed without payment the remainder of the closed cases have been resolved for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate

in view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines pratt  whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which sales costs and risks are shared at december 31 2012 the interests of third party participants in pratt  whitneydirected commercial jet engine programs ranged from 14 percent to 48 percent in addition pratt  whitney has interests in other engine programs including a 50 percent ownership interest in the engine alliance ea a joint venture with ge aviation which markets and manufactures the gp7000 engine for the airbus a380 aircraft pratt  whitney has entered into risk and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties for 40 percent of the products and services that pratt  whitney is responsible for providing to the ea pratt  whitney accounts for its interests in the ea joint venture under the equity method of accounting pratt  whitney continues to pursue additional collaboration partners 

as previously reported on june 29 2012 pratt  whitney rollsroyce plc rollsroyce mtu aero engines ag mtu and japanese aero engines corporation jaec participants in the iae international aero engines ag iae collaboration which sells and supports v2500 engines for the airbus a320 family of aircraft completed a restructuring of their interests in iae under the terms of the agreement rollsroyce sold its ownership and collaboration interests in iae to pratt  whitney while also entering into an agreement to license its v2500 intellectual property to pratt  whitney in exchange for the increased ownership and collaboration interests and intellectual property license pratt  whitney paid rollsroyce 15 billion at closing with additional payments due to rollsroyce during the fifteen year period following closing of the purchase conditional upon each hour flown by v2500powered aircraft in service at the closing rollsroyce will continue to support the program as a strategic supplier for the v2500 engine and continue to manufacture parts and assemble engines as previously reported pratt  whitney entered into a collaboration arrangement with mtu with respect to a portion of the collaboration interest in iae acquired from rollsroyce for consideration of approximately 233 million with additional payments due to pratt  whitney in the future as a result of these transactions pratt  whitney holds a 61 net interest in the collaboration also as previously reported on october 12 2011 pratt  whitney and rollsroyce announced an agreement to form a new joint venture subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions in which each will hold an equal share to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger midsize aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of midsize aircraft currently in service or in development on april 12 2012 mtu and jaec also agreed to participate in this new joint venture in which the partners will focus on highbypass ratio geared turbofan technology and will also collaborate on future studies of next generation propulsion systems 

  

the development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities pratt  whitney is under contract with the us air force to develop the f135 engine a derivative of pratt  whitney’s f119 engine to power the singleengine f35 lightning ii aircraft being developed by lockheed martin pratt  whitney achieved initial service release for the conventional takeoff and landingcarrier variant and short takeoff and vertical landing variant of the f135 engine in february 2010 and january 2011 respectively these propulsion system configurations are now certified for production and cleared for flight on the lockheed martin f35b stealth fighter jet and are in use by the us air force at eglin air force base and by the us marine corps at marine corps air station yuma in addition pratt  whitney is currently developing technology including the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine intended to enable it to power both currentlyproposed and future aircraft the purepower pw1000g engine targets a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels with lower environmental emissions and operating costs than current production engines in december 2010 airbus announced that it will offer a version of the purepower pw1000g engine as a new engine option to power its a320neo family of aircraft scheduled to enter into service in 2015 in november 2012 pratt  whitney commenced testing on this new engine the pw1100gjm being developed as part of a collaboration with mtu and jaec additionally purepower pw1000g engine models have been selected by bombardier to power the new cseries passenger aircraft by mitsubishi aircraft corporation to power the new mitsubishi regional jet and by irkut corporation of russia to power the proposed new irkut mc21 passenger aircraft these aircraft are scheduled to enter into service in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively further on january 8 2013 embraer announced the selection of the purepower engine to exclusively power the next generation of embraer’s ejet family of aircraft scheduled to enter service in 2018 the success of these aircraft and the purepower pw1000g family of engines is dependent upon many factors including technological challenges aircraft demand and regulatory approval based on these factors as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions additional investment in the purepower program may be required pwc has developed or is developing the pw210 engine family for helicopters manufactured by sikorsky agustawestland and the eurocopter group and is developing the purepower pw800 engine for the new generation of longrange and heavy business jets pratt  whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion 

pratt  whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers airlines and other aircraft operators aircraft leasing companies and the us and foreign governments pratt  whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and marketdriven safety and performance standards the frequently changing nature of these standards along with the long duration of aircraft engine development production and support programs creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability the vast majority of sales are made directly to the end customer and to a limited extent through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives sales to airbus pratt  whitney’s largest nongovernmental customer by sales were 25 percent and 16 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers sales to the us government were 27 percent and 24 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

sales generated by pratt  whitney’s international operations including us export sales were 57 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2012 and 2011 at december 31 2012 pratt  whitney’s backlog was 436 billion including 43 billion of us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2011 these amounts were 213 billion and 43 billion respectively this backlog increase is primarily due to the consolidation of iae and the incorporation of certain fleet maintenance aftermarket agreements in pratt  whitney’s backlog of the total pratt  whitney backlog at december 31 2012 approximately 54 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2013 pratt  whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales pratt  whitney’s backlog excludes orders for new commercial engines that have not yet achieved full aviation authority certification see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report for a description of our accounting for longterm contracts 

as described above in 2012 we implemented a new organizational structure that allows us to better serve customers drive growth and achieve further efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines as part of this new structure we created utc propulsion  aerospace systems a new organization consisting of pratt  whitney and utc aerospace systems we continue to report the financial and operational results of pratt  whitney and utc aerospace systems separately

sikorsky 

sikorsky is one of the world’s largest helicopter companies sikorsky manufactures military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and aircraft parts and services 

current major production programs at sikorsky include the uh60m black hawk mediumtransport helicopters and hh60m medevac helicopters for the us and foreign governments the s70 black hawk for foreign governments the mh60s and mh60r helicopters for the us navy the international naval hawk for multiple naval missions and the s76 and s92 helicopters for commercial operations the uh60m helicopter is the latest and most modern in a series of black hawk variants that sikorsky has been delivering to the us army since 1978 in july 2012 the us government and sikorsky signed a fiveyear multiservice contract for approximately 650 h60 helicopters actual production quantities will be determined yearbyyear over the life of the program based on funding allocations set by congress and the us department of defense acquisition priorities as well as the us foreign military sales program sikorsky is also developing the ch53k next generation heavy lift helicopter for the us marine corps and the ch148 derivative of the h92 helicopter a military variant of the s92 helicopter for the canadian government the latter is being developed under a fixedprice contract that provides for the development and production of 28 helicopters and a related support contract that provides for logistical support through march 2028 sikorsky currently anticipates that its revenues under these contracts will be approximately 43 billion revenues are subject to changes in underlying variables such as future flight hours as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates this is the largest and most expansive fixedprice development contract in sikorsky’s history sikorsky and the canadian government have a number of disputes relating to the contract including responsibility for delay of delivery of the fully configured and tested aircraft beyond the current contract delivery schedule and other disputes relating to development production and logistical support no aircraft were delivered in 2012 sikorsky intends to continue discussions with the canadian government aimed at resolving these open disputes and establishing a revised delivery schedule however as a result of ongoing delays with delivery of aircraft and given the outstanding contractual disputes in connection with this program still to be resolved sikorsky has taken a 157 million charge in the quarter ended december 31 2012 as further described in our 2012 annual report under the heading “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales mission equipment overhaul and repair services maintenance contracts and logistics support programs for helicopters and other aircraft sales are principally made to the us and foreign governments and commercial helicopter operators sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and provide logistics maintenance and repair services 

sales to the us government were 66 percent and 68 percent of total sikorsky segment sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively sales generated by sikorsky’s international operations including us export sales were 32 percent and 34 percent of total sikorsky segment sales in 2012 and 2011 respectively at december 31 2012 sikorsky’s backlog was 144 billion including 64 billion of us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2011 these amounts were 94 billion and 41 billion 

  

respectively this backlog increase is primarily due to increased firm commitments resulting from the fiveyear multiservice contract with the us government for uh60m helicopters referenced above of the total sikorsky backlog at december 31 2012 approximately 55 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2013 

other 

on march 14 2012 the board of directors of the company approved a plan for the divestiture of a number of our noncore businesses cash generated from these divestitures has been and will be used to repay the debt issued to finance the goodrich acquisition these noncore businesses include the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses which manufacture air compressors metering pumps and heavy duty process pumps for industries involved with chemical and hydrocarbon processing oil and gas production water and wastewater treatment and construction clipper windpower plc clipper a californiabased wind turbine manufacturer pratt  whitney rocketdyne a leader in the design development and manufacture of sophisticated space propulsion systems for military and commercial applications and pratt  whitney power systems which sells aeroderivative engines for industrial applications the sale of clipper was completed in the third quarter of 2012 and the sale of the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 on july 23 2012 we announced an agreement to sell pratt  whitney rocketdyne to gencorp inc for 550 million and on december 12 2012 we announced an agreement to sell pratt  whitney power systems to mitsubishi heavy industries the closings of the pratt  whitney rocketdyne and pratt  whitney power systems transactions are subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals 

on june 29 2012 management of the company approved a plan for the divestiture of utc power a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary and transportation applications on december 22 2012 we announced an agreement to sell our utc power unit to clearedge power subject to customary closing conditions 

the results of operations for the remaining divestitures of pratt  whitney rocketdyne and utc power including the net gainslosses expected on disposition and the related cash flows which result from these noncore businesses have been reclassified to “discontinued operations” in our consolidated statement of operations and our consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods presented the sale of pratt  whitney power systems was not reclassified to “discontinued operations” due to our expected level of continuing involvement in the business post disposition the remaining assets and liabilities of pratt  whitney rocketdyne utc power and pratt  whitney power systems have been reclassified to “assets held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale” in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2012 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the us and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees of pratt  whitney see notes 5 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell turbomeca and cfm international 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 24 billion or 41 percent of total sales in 2012 as compared with 20 billion or 35 percent of total sales in 2011 and 17 billion or 32 percent of total sales in 2010 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted 

  

to 17 billion in 2012 as compared to 15 billion in 2011 and 15 billion in 2010 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments of the total contract research and development costs 17 billion 14 billion and 15 billion were expensed in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

contracting with the us government entails certain unique risks us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 18 billion or 32 percent of our total sales for 2012 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government that recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our utc climate controls  security businesses and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of otis while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of utc and its affiliates these measures include us economic sanctions targeting iran 

section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itra added a new subsection r to section 13 of the exchange act requiring a public reporting issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to iran including activities not prohibited by us law and conducted outside the us by nonus affiliates in compliance with local law issuers must also file a notice with the sec if any disclosable activities under itra have been included in the annual or quarterly report upon receiving such a notice the sec is required under itra to transmit the notice to the president the house committees on foreign affairs and financial services and the senate committees on foreign relations and banking housing and urban affairs and is required to make these separate notices publicly available on its website 

  

the following activities are disclosed as required by section 13r1diii of the exchange act as transactions or dealings with the government of iran that have not been specifically authorized by a us federal department or agency 

utc climate controls  security in 2009 utc adopted a corporate policy prohibiting new business in or with iran in 2012 two of our nonus affiliates engaged in activities related to the orderly winding down of legacy business involving the sale of fire safety equipment through procurement agents to entities owned by the government of iran this business was pursuant to contracts entered into by simtronics as simtronics a norwegian company and its subsidiary water mist engineering as wme prior to utc climate controls  security’s acquisition of these two entities in april 2011 both companies were acquired following the adoption by utc in 2009 of the corporate policy prohibiting all new business in or with iran and both companies became subject to that policy upon acquisition 

during 2012 and pursuant to five legacy contracts simtronics and wme received payments and provided certain fire detection and fire suppression equipment for enduse by the pars oil  gas company which has been designated by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac as an entity owned or controlled by the government of iran these legacy contracts were not prohibited by applicable law when they were executed nor was the wind down of these contractual arrangements prohibited by utc’s policy at the time of acquisition simtronics and wme have halted all fulfillment activities related to these legacy contracts but may seek clearance from ofac in order to resolve a dispute over termination of a thirdparty agency agreement associated with these contracts and to complete certain remaining winddown activities simtronics and wme do not otherwise intend to continue or enter into any iranrelated activity the fire suppression products wme supplied incorporated a small amount of usorigin springs which are noncritical components and an appropriate disclosure has been filed with ofac 

the gross revenue and net profits attributable to these activities in 2012 for simtronics were 960000 and 70000 respectively and for wme were 2550000 and 560000 respectively 

otis  in 2012 nonus affiliates of otis conducted service maintenance andor modernization activities on elevators previously installed at iranian diplomatic premises in france kuwait and hungary under preexisting contracts the hungarian contract was undertaken with a local construction company not the iranian government all of the contracts in question have been terminated by these otis affiliates 

the following activities are disclosed as required by section 13r1di and ii of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended by itra as transactions or dealings with certain designated parties 

one of the payments received in 2012 by the french affiliate of otis for work at the iranian embassy in paris was drawn on a local office of bank melli of iran which was previously designated as subject to sanctions under executive order 13382 in 2012 an otis affiliate in germany performed elevator maintenance and repair services to support the frankfurt premises of bank saderat of iran which was designated as subject to sanctions in october 2007 under executive order 13224 

all of these elevator service and modernization contracts were permissible under applicable law when they were executed these otis affiliates have ceased performance under these contracts and do not intend to continue or enter into any new iranrelated activity an otis employee who is a us person for ofac purposes stationed outside the us provided unauthorized advice to the otis affiliate in kuwait with respect to ending its contract for services at iranian diplomatic premises in kuwait and an appropriate disclosure has been filed with ofac 

the gross revenues and net profits attributable to the activities of these otis affiliates in 2012 with respect to the iranian diplomatic premises in france kuwait and hungary were approximately 70000 including the single payment of approximately 1500 drawn on bank melli and 4000 respectively and were 4500 and 1500 respectively with respect to bank saderat

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2012 our total number of employees was approximately 218000 approximately 62 percent of which represents employees based outside the us during 2012 we negotiated or concluded 18 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at otis and utc climate controls  security in 2013 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at utc aerospace systems and pratt  whitney although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations particularly at sikorsky we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2013 will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks 

over the past few years market and economic conditions in the us and globally have been highly challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as the growing us deficit high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market in 2012 the global economy improved as compared to 2011 and continued to show signs of a gradual recovery from the significant downturn of 2008 and 2009 when the global economy experienced widespread recessionary conditions record levels of unemployment significant distress of financial institutions extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others however despite positive economic indicators seen since the beginning of 2011 uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery despite a recent slowdown in growth rates in china and other emerging economies global gross domestic product growth continues to be led by emerging markets particularly brazil russia india and china in the developed economies particularly in europe recovery remains uncertain due to persistent high unemployment in the us and europe a slow recovery of the us and european housing markets government budget reduction plans the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and concerns over the continuing european sovereign debt crisis further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our sales or liquidity 

although consumer confidence in the us has improved since the economic downturn it still remains low while as mentioned above unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broadbased and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us further there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows competitive position financial condition results of operations or our ability to access capital while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results as the majority of our sales are nonus based 

  

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 51 percent of our consolidated sales in 2012 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs the tightening of global credit markets and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate controls  security in addition the financial performance of utc climate controls  security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 49 percent of our consolidated sales in 2012 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement since 2011 uncertainty continues to exist as a result financial difficulties including bankruptcy of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability and backlog levels all of which could also reduce the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses other factors including future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could also dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses additionally because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2013 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws as further described below the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages and bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of us government contracts the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years 

we are also sensitive to us military budgets which may be impacted by numerous economic and political factors and which may fluctuate based on the policies of the current administration or congress in addition the specific government programs in which we participate or in which we may seek to participate in the future compete with other programs for consideration during the budget formulation and appropriation processes one or more of the programs that we currently support could be phasedout or terminated reductions in these existing programs unless offset by other programs and opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 60 percent of our 2012 consolidated sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay 

  

suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the us are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2012 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india mexico russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to do so in the future for example on june 29 2012 pratt  whitney acquired rollsroyce’s ownership and collaboration interests in iae and on july 26 2012 we completed our acquisition of goodrich further on october 12 2011 pratt  whitney and rollsroyce announced an agreement subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions to form a new joint venture to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger midsize aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of midsize aircraft currently in service or in development our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in 

  

managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time for example on december 13 2012 we completed the sale of the legacy hamilton sundstrand industrial businesses to bc partners and the carlyle group our divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the acquired goodrich business may underperform relative to our expectations the transaction may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies 

the success of the goodrich acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities from the integration of goodrich with our existing businesses the integration process is complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of goodrich and realizing our expectations for the acquisition include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our debt has increased as a result of the goodrich acquisition and will increase if we incur additional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity we have incurred substantial additional debt as a result of the goodrich acquisition as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 232 billion of total debt on a consolidated basis our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

 

  

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase 

our global and domestic revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets our revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes there are currently no amounts outstanding under these credit facilities our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

  

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop for example certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers these systems and end products may incorporate additional advanced technologies manufactured by third parties that involve additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

exports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license from the us department of state the us department of commerce or the us department of the treasury 

as an exporter we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products services and technology from the us and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations in the us these laws include among others the us export administration regulations ear administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls dtcc and trade sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of treasury office of foreign assets control certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the itar or represent socalled “dual use” items governed by the ear as a result these products require individual validated licenses in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties fines investigations adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties as previously disclosed on june 28 2012 we entered into a consent agreement with the dtcc and a deferred prosecution agreement with the us department of justice regarding separate but related export licensing compliance violations both of which impose significant continuing obligations any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products the length of time required by the licensing processes can vary potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation tax environmental and other legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation tax and other legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments or other damages in certain cases treble damages as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to 

  

new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

in the area of taxes changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 percent likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which any such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments certain of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and internal control policies these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes or other remedial actions violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

our financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications in addition our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the us which could have a negative impact on sales volume we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures as described above 

any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend f100 engine litigation 

as previously disclosed the us department of justice doj sued us in 1999 in the us district court for the southern district of ohio claiming that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law this lawsuit relates to the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and general electric’s f110 engine the doj alleges that the government overpaid for f100 engines under contracts awarded by the us air force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements at trial of this matter completed in december 2004 the government claimed pratt  whitney’s liability to be 624 million on august 1 2008 the trial court judge held that the air force had not suffered any actual damages because pratt  whitney had made 

  

significant price concessions however the trial court judge found that pratt  whitney violated the false claims act due to inaccurate statements contained in its 1983 offer in the absence of actual damages the trial court judge awarded the doj the maximum civil penalty of 709 million or 10000 for each of the 709 invoices pratt  whitney submitted in 1989 and later under the contracts in september 2008 both the doj and utc appealed the decision to the sixth circuit court of appeals in november 2010 the sixth circuit affirmed pratt  whitney’s liability under the false claims act and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 

on june 18 2012 the trial court found that pratt  whitney had breached other obligations imposed by common law based on the same conduct with respect to which the court previously found liability under the false claims act under the common law claims the us air force may seek damages for events occurring before march 3 1989 which are not recoverable under the false claims act further proceedings at the trial court will determine the damages if any relating to the false claims act and common law claims the government continues to seek damages of 624 million plus interest pratt  whitney continues to contend that the government suffered no actual damages the parties have submitted briefs and await a decision from the trial court should the government ultimately prevail the outcome of this matter could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid 

department of defense cost accounting standards claim

dpa have been reported by utc its subsidiaries and its majorityowned or controlled affiliates to the appropriate officials of the us government 4 cooperate with law enforcement in specified areas and 5 implement specified compliance training initiatives 

we believe the previously disclosed potential liability recognized as of march 31 2012 of 55 million will be sufficient to discharge all amounts due under the ca and dpa 

on june 28 2012 by reason of pwc’s guilty plea to a criminal violation of the aeca and the itar dtcc imposed a partial statutory debarment on pwc with respect to obtaining new or renewed itar license privileges the debarment does not affect existing itar licensesauthorities nor does it extend to programs supporting 1 the us government 2 nato allies or 3 “major nonnato allies” as defined in the itar pwc may seek “transaction exception” approvals on a casebycase basis for new or renewed itar licensing in other cases during the period of debarment pwc may apply for full reinstatement of itar privileges after one year on december 20 2012 utc entered into an administrative agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official where army officials determined that the utc entities are presently responsible and that further action is not necessary to protect the us government’s interests pursuant to the federal acquisition regulation and the national defense appropriations act the agreement with the department of the army suspension and debarment official completes the department of defense review of the utc entities’ present responsibility under the federal acquisition regulation and pwc’s eligibility to receive funds appropriated for fiscal year 2012 under the national defense appropriations act

the development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities pratt  whitney is under contract with the us air force to develop the f135 engine a derivative of pratt  whitney’s f119 engine to power the singleengine f35 lightning ii aircraft being developed by lockheed martin pratt  whitney achieved initial service release for the conventional takeoff and landingcarrier variant and short takeoff and vertical landing variant of the f135 engine in february 2010 and january 2011 respectively these propulsion system configurations are now certified for production and cleared for flight on the lockheed martin f35b stealth fighter jet in addition pratt  whitney is currently developing technology including the purepower pw1000g geared turbofan engine intended to enable it to power both currentlyproposed and future aircraft the purepower pw1000g engine targets a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels with lower environmental emissions and operating costs than current production engines in 2009 pratt  whitney successfully completed ground and flight testing of a demonstrator engine for the purepower pw1000g engine in december 2010 airbus announced that it will offer a version of the purepower pw1000g engine as a new engine option to power its a320neo family of aircraft scheduled to enter into service in 2015 in september 2011 pratt  whitney announced a new collaboration with japan aero engines corporation jaec and mtu aero engines ag mtu to provide the purepower pw1100gjm engine for the airbus a320neo program under the collaboration agreement mtu will hold an 18 percent share and be responsible for the engine’s low pressure turbine and participate jointly with pratt  whitney to provide the high pressure compressor for the engine jaec will hold a 23 percent share and be responsible for the engine fan low pressure compressor and combustordiffuser pratt  whitney will be responsible for the remainder of the purepower pw1100gjm engine and systems integration additionally purepower pw1000g engine models have been selected by bombardier to power the new cseries passenger aircraft and by mitsubishi aircraft corporation to power the new mitsubishi regional jet mrj scheduled to enter into service in 2013 and 2014 respectively in 2011 the initial production version of the bombardier cseries purepower pw1000g engine successfully completed 115 hours of flight testing and the initial production version of the mrj purepower pw1000g engine successfully completed over 300 hours of ground testing irkut corporation of russia has also selected the purepower pw1000g engine to power the proposed new irkut mc21 passenger aircraft which is scheduled to enter into service in 2016 the success of these aircraft and the purepower pw1000g family of engines is dependent upon many factors including technological challenges aircraft demand and regulatory approval based on these factors as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions additional investment in the purepower program may be required pratt  whitney has also received federal aviation authority faa and european aviation safety agency easa certification for the advantage70 upgrade to its pw4000 engine for airbus a330 aircraft the advantage70 upgrade is intended to reduce maintenance and fuel costs and increase thrust pwr is developing a liquid fuel j2x engine to support nasa’s space launch system pwr is also upgrading the performance of the rs68 and rl10 engines to support us air force launch requirements pwc is developing the pw210 engine for sikorsky’s s76d helicopter and the purepower pw800 engine for the new generation of longrange and heavy business jets pratt  whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion 

pratt  whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers airlines and other aircraft operators aircraft leasing companies space launch vehicle providers and the us and foreign governments pratt  whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and marketdriven safety and performance standards the frequently changing nature of these standards along with the long duration of aircraft engine development production and support programs creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability the vast majority of sales are made directly to the end customer and to a limited extent through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives sales to airbus were 16 percent and 12 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers sales to the us government were 28 percent and 32 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

sales generated by pratt  whitney’s international operations including us export sales were 54 percent and 52 percent of total pratt  whitney segment sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2011 pratt  whitney’s backlog was 224 billion including 53 billion of us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2010 these amounts were 235 billion and 51 billion respectively of the total pratt  whitney backlog at december 31 2011 approximately 46 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2012 pratt  whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales pratt  whitney’s backlog excludes orders for new commercial engines that have not yet achieved full aviation authority certification see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report for a description of our accounting for longterm contracts 

as described above to better serve customers and to drive growth and achieve efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines we announced a new organizational structure in september 2011 as part of this new structure we created utc propulsion  aerospace systems a new organization consisting of pratt  whitney and hamilton sundstrand we will continue to report the financial and operational results of pratt  whitney and hamilton sundstrand separately

sikorsky 

sikorsky is one of the world’s largest helicopter companies sikorsky manufactures military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and aircraft parts and services 

current major production programs at sikorsky include the uh60m black hawk mediumtransport helicopters and hh60m medevac helicopters for the us and foreign governments the s70 black hawk for foreign governments the mh60s and mh60r helicopters for the us navy the international naval hawk for multiple naval missions and the s76 and s92 helicopters for commercial operations the uh60m helicopter is the latest and most modern in a series of black hawk variants that sikorsky has been delivering to the us army since 1978 in december 2007 the us government and sikorsky signed a fiveyear multiservice contract for h60 helicopters to be delivered to the us army and us navy which include the uh60m hh60m mh60s and mh60r upon completion of the contract in 2013 sikorsky expects to have delivered approximately 690 aircraft sikorsky is in negotiations with the us government for a new fiveyear multiservice contract for h60 helicopters sikorsky is also developing the ch53k next generation heavy lift helicopter for the us marine corps and the ch148 derivative of the h92 helicopter a military variant of the s92 helicopter for the canadian government the latter is being developed under a fixedprice contract that provides for the development and production of 28 helicopters and related logistical support through march 2028 the current contract value is estimated to be 45 billion and is subject to changes in underlying variables such as future flight hours as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates this is the largest and most expansive fixedprice development contract in sikorsky’s history as previously disclosed in june 2010 sikorsky and the canadian government signed contract amendments that revised the delivery schedule and 

  

contract specifications and established the requirements for the first six interim aircraft to enable initial operational test and evaluation activities the amendments also included modifications to the liquidated damages schedule readjustment of payment schedules resolution of open disputes and other program enhancements sikorsky recognized revenue in 2011 upon completing a significant milestone for work related to four interim configuration helicopters delivery of the final configuration aircraft is scheduled to begin in 2012 these aircraft will require further software testing and upgrades before full mission capability can be achieved sikorsky is in discussions with the canadian government concerning the need for additional interim aircraft schedules to complete remaining work and the resolution of open disputes 

sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales overhaul and repair services maintenance contracts and logistics support programs for helicopters and other aircraft sales are principally made to the us and foreign governments and commercial helicopter operators sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and provide logistics maintenance and repair services 

sales to the us government were 68 percent of total sikorsky segment sales in both 2011 and 2010 sales generated by sikorsky’s international operations including us export sales were 34 percent and 33 percent of total sikorsky segment sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2011 sikorsky’s backlog was 94 billion including 41 billion of us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts at december 31 2010 these amounts were 93 billion and 42 billion respectively of the total sikorsky backlog at december 31 2011 approximately 49 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2012 

other 

utc power is a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary and transportation applications utc power delivered more than 280 of its 200kw phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants for stationary installations since 1992 before ceasing production of this model in 2009 utc power began delivery of its newlydesigned 400kw phosphoric acid fuel cell to date utc power has delivered more than 50 of these 400kw units to customers worldwide this new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market utc power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane pem technology puremotion 120 power plants are currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in connecticut california and europe utc power is currently developing pem fuel cells for submarine applications 

although fuel cells are generally believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in either early commercialization or the development stage continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to fully commercialize fuel cell technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced 

in december 2010 we completed the acquisition of clipper windpower plc clipper a californiabased wind turbine manufacturer this investment is intended to expand our power generation portfolio and allow us to participate in the wind power business by leveraging our expertise in blade technology turbines and gearbox design 

the results of utc power and clipper are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report 

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic industry and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2011 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees of pratt  whitney see notes 4 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a 

  

significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell and turbomeca 

research and development 

because changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 21 billion or 35 percent of total sales in 2011 as compared with 17 billion or 32 percent of total sales in 2010 and 16 billion or 30 percent of total sales in 2009 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed in our aerospace businesses amounted to 19 billion in 2011 as compared to 20 billion in 2010 and 21 billion in 2009 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments of the total contract research and development costs 18 billion 19 billion and 21 billion were expensed in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 26 billion or 45 percent of our total sales for 2011 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fire  security respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

  

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the united states we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2011 our total number of employees was approximately 199900 approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2011 we negotiated or concluded 31 domestic collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at carrier in 2012 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at carrier and otis although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations particularly at sikorsky we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report 

for a discussion of other matters which may affect our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations including the risks of our international operations see the further discussion under the headings “general” and “description of business by segment” in this section item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2011 annual report 

cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks 

in 2011 the global economy improved as compared to 2010 and continued to show signs of a gradual recovery from the significant downturn of 2008 and 2009 when the global economy experienced widespread recessionary conditions record levels of unemployment significant distress of financial institutions extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others however despite positive economic indicators seen in the beginning of 2011 uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall rate and stability of the recovery global gross domestic product growth continues to be led by emerging markets particularly in brazil russia india and china while in the developed economies particularly in europe the recovery remains uncertain due to persistent high unemployment in the us and europe a weak us and european housing market government budget reduction plans the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and concerns over the deepening european sovereign debt crisis as a result further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our sales or liquidity 

  

although consumer confidence in the us has improved since the economic downturn it still remains low while as mentioned above unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broadbased and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us further there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows competitive position financial condition results of operations or our ability to access capital while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators and government procurement strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results as the majority of our sales are nonus based 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 58 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs the tightening of global credit markets and other global and political factors for example a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect carrier’s business in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 42 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement in 2011 uncertainty continues to exist as a result financial difficulties including bankruptcy of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engines aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability and backlog levels all of which could reduce the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses future terrorist actions pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2012 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages and bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of us government contracts the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment 

  

generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges in addition we are also sensitive to us military budgets which may fluctuate based on the policies of a new administration or congress 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 61 percent of our total 2011 segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2011 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india mexico russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including civil disturbances health concerns cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and expect to do so in the future for example on september 21 2011 we announced an agreement to acquire goodrich and on october 12 2011 pratt  whitney announced that rollsroyce will sell its interests in iae to pratt  whitney further on october 12 2011 pratt  whitney and rollsroyce also announced an agreement to form a new joint venture to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger midsize aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of midsize aircraft currently in service or in development our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction in addition the success of our pending acquisition of goodrich and pratt  whitney’s recently announced transactions with rollsroyce plc will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to and consummation of the proposed transactions the timing of consummation of the proposed transactions and the ability of the parties to secure regulatory approvals and in the case of the goodrich transaction the approval of goodrich’s shareholders in a timely manner any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could affect our future financial results 

we may not complete the goodrich acquisition or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate the acquired business may underperform relative to our expectations the transaction may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies 

the goodrich acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions as described above and the completion of the transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties the unpredictability of the business and regulatory conditions affecting the industries in which we and goodrich operate the uncertainty of regulatory approvals the requirement that the merger agreement be adopted by the holders of at least twothirds of the outstanding shares of goodrich common stock and other risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our ability to complete the acquisition or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate 

in addition if the acquisition is consummated the success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities from the integration of goodrich with our existing businesses the integration process may be complex costly and timeconsuming the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of goodrich and realizing our expectations for the acquisition include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we have outstanding debt and we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with financing the acquisition of goodrich our debt will increase as a result of the acquisition and any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition and will increase if we incur additional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 103 billion of total debt on a consolidated basis we anticipate that goodrich will have approximately 19 billion of net debt as of the closing of the acquisition of goodrich and we further anticipate incurring significant additional debt in connection with the financing of the acquisition our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

 we may incur significantly more debt in the future if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt the risks described above could increase 

our current global and domestic revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets our current revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes there are currently no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities our longterm debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are subject to litigation tax environmental and other legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation tax and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts independently failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related 

  

interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

in the area of taxes changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 percent likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which any such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our financial performance may be adversely affected by information technology and other business disruptions 

our business may be impacted by disruptions including information technology attacks or failures threats to physical security as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature pandemics or other public health crises cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technologyrelated and other potential disruptions however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents 

  

issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications in addition our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the united states which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us we may also be subject to disruptions losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data we have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency 

any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

as previously disclosed on february 21 2007 the european commission’s competition directorate eu commission ruled that otis’ subsidiaries in belgium luxembourg and the netherlands and a portion of the business of otis’ german subsidiary violated european union eu competition rules and assessed a € 225 million approximately 300 million civil fine against otis its relevant local entities and utc which was paid during 2007 in may 2007 we filed an appeal of the decision with the general court of the european court of justice general court on july 13 2011 the general court rejected our appeal on september 23 2011 we filed an appeal of the judgment with the european court of justice

a significant portion of our activities are subject to export control regulation by the us department of state state department under the us arms export control act and international traffic in arms regulations itar from time to time we identify investigate remediate and voluntarily disclose to the state department’s office of defense trade controls compliance dtcc potential violations of the itar dtcc administers the state department’s authority under the itar to impose civil penalties and other administrative sanctions for violations including debarment from engaging in the export of defense articles or defense services most of our voluntary disclosures are resolved without the imposition of penalties or other sanctions however in november 2011 dtcc informed us that it considers certain of our voluntary disclosures filed since 2005 to reflect deficiencies warranting penalties and sanctions we are currently in discussions with dtcc to reach a consent agreement which we anticipate will provide for a payment by the company and commitments regarding additional remedial compliance efforts 

the voluntary disclosures that we anticipate will be addressed in the consent agreement currently under discussion include 2006 and 2007 disclosures regarding the export by hamilton sundstrand to pwc of certain modifications to dualuse electronic engine control software and the reexport by pwc of those software modifications and subsequent pwcdeveloped patches to china during the period 20022004 for use in the development of the z10 chinese military helicopter the doj has also separately conducted a criminal investigation of the matters addressed in these disclosures as well as the accuracy and adequacy of the disclosures we have been cooperating with the doj’s investigation since november 2011 we have been in discussions with the doj to resolve this matter 

we continue to evaluate the range of possible outcomes of these separate but related export compliance matters and have recognized a potential liability at december 31 2011 of 45 million we are currently unable to predict the precise timing or outcome of the discussions we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or collectively will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

other 

utc power is a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary and transportation applications utc power has delivered more than 280 of its 200kw phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants for stationary installations since 1992 utc power ceased production of the 200kw unit in 2009 and began deliveries of its 400kw phosphoric acid fuel cell this new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market utc power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane pem technology puremotion 120 power plants are currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in connecticut california and europe utc power is currently developing pem fuel cells for submarine applications in addition utc power is the maker of alkalinebased fuel cells used to provide electricity and drinking water to the us space shuttle 

although fuel cells are generally believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in either early commercialization or the development stage continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to fully commercialize fuel cell technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced 

in january 2010 we acquired a 495 equity stake in clipper windpower plc clipper a californiabased wind turbine manufacturer in december 2010 we completed the acquisition of all of the remaining shares of clipper this investment is intended to expand our power generation portfolio and allow us to enter the wind power market by leveraging our expertise in blade technology turbines and gearbox design 

the results of utc power and clipper are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report 

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2010 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  

  

whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell and turbomeca 

research and development 

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1746 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2010 as compared with 1558 million or 30 percent of total sales in 2009 and 1771 million or 30 percent of total sales in 2008 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 1951 million in 2010 as compared to 2124 million in 2009 and 2101 million in 2008 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments of the total contract research and development costs 1890 million 2095 million and 2008 million were expensed in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 2961 million or 55 percent of our total sales for 2010 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

in addition we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs 

  

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fire  security respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

intellectual property and raw materials and supplies 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the united states we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2010 our total number of employees was approximately 208200 approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states the number of employees increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflecting the impact of acquisitions across the company most notably the 2010 acquisition of the ge security business which we are in the process of integrating within the utc fire  security segment the increase in the number of employees in 2010 associated with acquisition activity was partially offset by headcount reductions associated with initiated restructuring actions during 2010 we renegotiated eight domestic multiyear collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at pratt  whitney hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky in 2011 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at carrier although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations particularly at sikorsky we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report

our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks 

the global economy which experienced a significant downturn throughout 2008 and 2009 including widespread recessionary conditions record levels of unemployment significant distress of financial institutions extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010 however while some economic indicators trended positively the overall rate of global recovery experienced during the course of 2010 has been uneven and uncertainty continues to exist over the stability of the recovery global gross domestic product growth in 2010 was led by emerging markets in the developed economies particularly in europe where the recovery is sluggish the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and lingering high unemployment have encouraged the use of expansionary monetary policies to sustain economic recoveries although consumer confidence in the us has improved since the economic downturn it still remains low while unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed there can be 

  

no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad based and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us further there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows competitive position financial condition results of operations or our ability to access capital while these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airline customers and business jet operators and government procurement strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 57 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs the tightening of the us credit markets and other global and political factors a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely impact carrier’s business in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 43 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs of gradual improvement in 2010 uncertainty continues to exist as a result financial difficulties including bankruptcy of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders reductions in our aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engine and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability and backlog levels all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2011 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations relating to certain of our us government contracts if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges in addition we are also sensitive to us military budgets which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress 

  

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency fluctuations economic conditions and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 60 of our total 2010 segment sales derived from international operations including us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro and the canadian dollar for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar sales see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india mexico russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including civil disturbances health concerns cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in many instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

  

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in connection with these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners however our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could affect our future financial results 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internallyproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies identification of emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets validation of innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated due to the design complexity of our products we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule furthermore we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete any of the foregoing could have a material adverse affect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to litigation tax environmental and other legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation tax and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things possible liability relating to product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters if convicted or found liable we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts independently failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs 

  

in the area of taxes changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the period in which such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs 

we may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and control costs we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives these plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings we may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated costs reductions or may otherwise harm our business which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on our intellectual property and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications in addition our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the united states which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us 

any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs andor temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services

as previously disclosed on february 21 2007 the european commission’s competition directorate eu commission ruled that otis’ subsidiaries in belgium luxembourg and the netherlands and a portion of the business of otis’ german subsidiary violated european union eu competition rules and assessed a € 225 million approximately 300 million civil fine against otis its relevant local entities and utc which was paid during 2007 in may 2007 we filed an appeal of the decision before the general court of the european court of justice a decision on the appeal is expected within the next twelve months depending upon the outcome a further appeal by either party to the european court of justice is possible

other 

utc power is a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology to stationary and transportation applications in the application of stationary fuel cell power utc has delivered more than 260 200kw phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants since 1992 utc power ceased production of the 200kw unit in 2009 and began deliveries of its 400kw phosphoric acid fuel cell this new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market utc power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane pem technology including its puremotion 120 power plant which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in connecticut california and europe utc power is currently developing pem fuel cells for submarine applications in addition utc power is the maker of alkalinebased fuel cells used to provide electricity and drinking water to the us space shuttle 

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in either early commercialization or development continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to fully commercialize fuel cell technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced 

in 2009 we completed the transition of utc power’s microturbinebased combined cooling heating and power systems business to carrier’s businesses its geothermal power systems business to pratt  whitney’s power systems business and program management of its space and defense fuel cell power plant business to hamilton sundstrand’s energy space and defense business the results of utc power are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2009 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell and turbomeca for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report 

research and development 

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1558 million or 30 percent of total sales in 2009 as compared with 1771 million or 30 percent of total sales in 2008 and 1678 million or 31 percent of total sales in 2007 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 2124 million in 2009 as compared to 2101 million in 2008 and 2123 million in 2007 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments of the totals 2095 million 2008 million and 1872 million were expensed in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 2874 million or 55 percent of our total sales for 2009 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report 

  

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fire  security respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

intellectual property and raw materials 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the united states we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our business segments for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2009 our total employment was approximately 206700 approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2009 we renegotiated twelve domestic multiyear collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at sikorsky otis and carrier in 2010 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at pratt  whitney carrier and hamilton sundstrand although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations particularly at sikorsky we do not anticipate such problems in the renegotiation of the above contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report

our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks 

as widely reported the global economic turmoil that began in 2008 continued throughout 2009 including widespread recessionary conditions record levels of unemployment significant distress of financial institutions extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme financial and economic conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values in recent months certain indices and economic data have begun to show first signs of improvement and stabilization in the macroeconomic environment however there can be no assurance that these improvements will be broadbased and sustainable or that they will affect markets relevant to us further there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our revenues results of operations financial condition and ability to access capital these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity 

  

such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airline customers and business jet operators and government procurement strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 58 of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs the tightening of the us credit markets and other global and political factors in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 42 of our consolidated revenues in 2009 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature the challenging operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines is expected to continue as a result financial difficulties including bankruptcy of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders reductions in our aerospace revenues and losses under existing contracts in addition capital spending and demand for aircraft engine and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability and backlog levels all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2010 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges in addition we are also sensitive to us military budgets which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 59 of our total 2009 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide 

  

currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our revenues are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro and the canadian dollar for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar revenues see note 1 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements 

in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india russia south africa and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products emerging market operations can present many risks including civil disturbances health concerns cultural differences such as employment and business practices volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of divested businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in connection with these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition the recent effectiveness of revisions to accounting for business combinations which among other things require companies to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue 

  

advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of internal and supplierproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors achieving cost and production efficiencies validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties we or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses particularly pratt  whitney sikorsky and hamilton sundstrand will produce aircraft engines helicopters aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation tax environmental and other legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of litigation tax and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things litigation concerning product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and laws governing improper business practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation if convicted or found liable we could be subject to fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts independently failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws and regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to laws and regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental laws and regulations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures in the area of tax changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities including tax authorities in addition to ongoing investigations there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions and existing investigations could be expanded while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as previously disclosed the department of justice doj sued us in 1999 in the us district court for the southern district of ohio claiming that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law this lawsuit relates to the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and general electric’s f110 engine the doj alleges that the government overpaid for f100 engines under contracts awarded by the us air force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements at trial of this matter completed in december 2004 the government claimed pratt  whitney’s liability to be 624 million on august 1 2008 the trial court judge held that the air force had not suffered any actual damages because pratt  whitney had made significant price concessions however the trial court judge found that pratt  whitney violated the false claims act due to inaccurate statements 

  

contained in the 1983 offer in the absence of actual damages the trial court judge awarded the doj the maximum civil penalty of 709 million or 10000 for each of the 709 invoices pratt  whitney submitted in 1989 and later under the contracts both the doj and utc have appealed the decision should the government ultimately prevail the outcome of this matter could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid 

in december 2008 the department of defense dod issued a contract claim against sikorsky to recover overpayments the dod alleges it has incurred since january 2003 in connection with cost accounting changes approved by the dod and implemented by sikorsky in 1999 and 2006 these changes relate to the calculation of material overhead rates in government contracts the dod claims that sikorsky’s liability is approximately 83 million including interest through december 2009 we believe this claim is without merit and sikorsky filed an appeal in december 2009 with the us court of federal claims 

as previously disclosed on february 21 2007 the european commission’s competition directorate eu commission ruled that otis’ subsidiaries in belgium luxembourg and the netherlands and a portion of the business of otis’ german subsidiary violated european union eu competition rules and assessed a € 225 million approximately 300 million civil fine against otis its relevant local entities and utc which was paid during 2007 in may 2007 we filed an appeal of the decision before the eu’s european court of first instance a decision on the appeal is expected within the next twelve months depending upon the outcome a further appeal by either party to the european court of justice is possible 

on september 21 2009 pratt  whitney announced plans to close its connecticut airfoil repair operations facility in east hartford connecticut by the second quarter of 2010 and its engine overhaul facility in cheshire connecticut by early 2011 on september 22 2009 the international association of machinists iam filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of connecticut in hartford connecticut alleging that pratt  whitney’s decision to close these facilities and transfer certain work to facilities outside connecticut breached the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with the iam which expires on december 5 2010 and seeking to enjoin pratt  whitney from moving the work for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement pratt  whitney believes that it has fully complied with the collective bargaining agreement and that the iam’s contentions are without merit on february 5 2010 following a trial on the merits the court issued a declaratory judgment that pratt  whitney had breached its obligations under the collective bargaining agreement and permanently enjoined pratt  whitney from closing the facilities and transferring the work described in the challenged plans for the duration of the current collective bargaining agreement pratt  whitney is reviewing the decision and considering whether to appeal pratt  whitney has recorded 53 million of restructuring costs associated with these planned closures we do not believe that resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

like many other industrial companies in recent years we or our subsidiaries are named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises while we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currentlymanufactured products certain of our historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos a substantial majority of these asbestosrelated claims have been covered by insurance or other forms of indemnity or have been dismissed without payment the remainder of the closed cases have been resolved for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate based on the information currently available we do not believe that resolution of these asbestosrelated matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

except as otherwise noted above we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition a further discussion of government contracts and related investigations as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities can be found under the heading “other matters relating to our business as a whole – compliance with environmental and other government regulations” in item 1 “business” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

other 

utc power has developed products and services for commercial buildings using 200kw phosphoric acid fuel cell and microturbinedriven absorption chilling systems these systems are highly efficient combined cooling heating and power systems in addition utc power has developed a geothermal power system capable of producing power from the lowest temperature geothermal water used to date to produce electricity utc power is the world leader in the application of fuel cell technology to transportation applications including automobiles transit buses and the us space shuttle program utc power is also a provider of energy advisory and consulting services aimed at making commercial buildings more energy efficient 

utc power is the world leader in stationary fuel cell power with more than 260 200kw phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants sold since 1992 utc power has also developed a 400kw fuel cell which is scheduled to be placed into service in 2009 this new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market utc power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane pem technology including its puremotion 120 power plant which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in connecticut california and europe utc power is currently developing pem fuel cells for submarine applications in addition utc power is a maker of alkalinebased fuel cells used to provide electricity and drinking water to the us space shuttle 

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in either early commercialization or development continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to fully commercialize fuel cell technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced 

utc power merged with utc fuel cells effective january 1 2007 with utc power continuing as the surviving entity utc is in the process of incorporating utc power’s combined cooling heating and power systems business within carrier’s businesses its geothermal power systems business within pratt  whitney’s power systems business and its space and defense fuel cell power plant business within hamilton sundstrand’s energy space and defense business these transitions are expected to be completed during the first half of 2009 the results of utc power and utc fuel cells are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report 

  

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2008 annual report in item 1 “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation rollsroyce honeywell and turbomeca for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report 

research and development 

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1771 million or 31 percent of total sales in 2008 as compared with 1678 million or 31 percent of total sales in 2007 and 1529 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2006 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 2101 million in 2008 as compared to 2123 million in 2007 and 1952 million in 2006 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments of the totals 2008 million 1872 million and 1621 million were expensed in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 2721 million or 46 percent of our total sales for 2008 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the 

  

environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fire  security respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

intellectual property and raw materials 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the united states we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our business segments for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2008 our total employment was approximately 223100 approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2008 we renegotiated thirteen multiyear collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at carrier hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky in 2009 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at sikorsky and carrier we do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report 

for a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows including the risks of our international operations see the further discussion under the headings “general” and “description of business by segment” in this section item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 annual report 

cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results 

this form 10k contains statements which to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the securities laws from time to time oral or written forwardlooking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public these forwardlooking statements are intended to provide management’s current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance based on assumptions 

  

currently believed to be valid forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “plans” “strategy” “prospects” “estimate” “project” “target” “anticipate” “guidance” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance these include among others statements relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements this annual report on form 10k for 2008 includes important information as to these factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in the “business” section under the headings “general” “description of business by segment” and “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and in the “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” sections additional important information as to these factors is included in our 2008 annual report in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the headings “business overview” “critical accounting estimates” “environmental matters” and “restructuring and other costs” for additional information identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements see our reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k filed with the sec from time to time

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in the “business” section under the headings “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2008 annual report 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic risks 

as widely reported financial markets in the united states europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments similarly this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity financial strength of airline customers and government procurement strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies such as the euro the canadian dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

  

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 62 percent of our revenues in 2008 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory changes interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs the tightening of the us credit markets and other global and political factors in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries which are cyclical in nature the challenging operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines is expected to continue as a result capital spending by commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues worldwide airline profits airline consolidation airline insolvencies competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions corporate profitability and backlog levels all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2009 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing technological improvements regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges in addition we are also sensitive to us military budgets which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or congress 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 64 percent of our total 2008 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from us export sales changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency 

  

fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products as a result our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for cross border transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our revenues are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states is incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro and the canadian dollar for operating units with us dollar sales and local currency costs there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage certain exposures we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar revenues see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india russia and south africa that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk 

while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition the recent effectiveness of statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” which among other things requires companies to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses 

  

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of internal and supplierproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors achieving cost and production efficiencies validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties we may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities pratt  whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in this section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2007 annual report in item i “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation and rollsroyce for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report 

research and development 

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1678 million or 31 percent of total sales in 2007 as compared with 1529 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2006 and 1367 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2005 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 2123 million in 2007 as compared to 1952 million in 2006 and 1650 million in 2005 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments of the totals 1872 million 1621 million and 1478 million were expensed in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 2221 million or 41 percent of our total sales for 2007 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial reductions we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fs respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

intellectual property and raw materials 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers like other users in the united states we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our business segments for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2007 our total employment was approximately 225600 approximately 66 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2007 we renegotiated twentytwo multiyear collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at otis and pratt  whitney in 2008 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at carrier and hamilton sundstrand we do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report 

for a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows including the risks of our international operations see the further discussion under the headings “general” and “description of business by segment” in this section item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2007 annual report 

cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results 

this form 10k contains statements which to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the securities laws from time to time oral or written forwardlooking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public these forwardlooking statements are intended to provide management’s current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance based on assumptions currently believed to be valid forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “plans” “strategy” “prospects” “estimate” “project” “target” “anticipate” “guidance” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance these include among others statements relating to

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2007 annual report 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated approximately 37 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries the aerospace industry is cyclical and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions worldwide airline profits corporate profitability and backlog levels also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2008 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled at times our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixedprice development contracts which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing regulatory changes the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2007 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigation including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the united states could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges 

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approximately 62 percent of our total 2007 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from us export sales fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our revenues are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

the majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in us dollars consistent with established industry practice while the majority of costs at locations outside the united states is incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro and the canadian dollar for differences between us dollar sales and local currency costs there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currencies to manage this exposure we employ longterm hedging strategies associated with us dollar revenues see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report for a discussion of our hedging strategies 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india russia and south africa that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in the manufacturing of our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of internal and supplierproduced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors achieving cost and production efficiencies validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products these factors involve significant

risks and uncertainties we may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities pratt  whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things litigation concerning product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights government contracts taxes environmental matters and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and sales and trading practices we or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation if convicted or found liable we could be subject to fines penalties repayments other damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts independently failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by generally accepted accounting principles we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time if there is a range of estimates and no amount within that range is more likely to occur than another then we accrue the minimum amount subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k

 our fixed assets as of december 31 2007 include the manufacturing facilities and nonmanufacturing facilities such as warehouses set forth in the tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations the facilities warehouses machinery and equipment in use as of december 31 2007 are in good operating condition are wellmaintained and substantially all are in regular use 

our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at december 31 2007 for the production of our products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products we continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and based on that review may from time to time adjust our facility needs

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as previously disclosed the department of justice doj sued us in 1999 in the us district court for the southern district of ohio claiming that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law this lawsuit relates to the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and general electric’s f110 engine the doj alleges that the government overpaid for f100 engines under contracts awarded by the us air force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim could be assessed if the court finds that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law damages would accrue prejudgment interest trial of this matter was completed in december 2004 at trial the government claimed pratt  whitney’s liability is 624 million we believe that this estimate is substantially overstated denied any liability and vigorously defended against the doj’s claims a decision is pending should the government ultimately prevail the outcome of this matter could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid 

as previously disclosed on february 21 2007 the european commission’s competition directorate eu commission ruled that otis’ subsidiaries in belgium luxembourg and the netherlands and a portion of the business of otis’ german subsidiary violated european union eu competition rules and assessed a €225 million approximately 300 million civil fine against otis its relevant local entities and utc which was paid during 2007 in may 2007 we filed an appeal of the decision before the eu’s european court of first instance resolution of the matter is not expected within the next twelve months 

as previously disclosed during the first quarter of 2007 the austrian federal competition authority competition authority filed a complaint with the cartel court in austria cartel court against otis’ austrian subsidiary in connection with an investigation of unlawful collusive arrangements in the austrian elevator and escalator industry on december 14 2007 the cartel court at the request of the competition authority assessed civil fines against the participants in the collusive arrangements including a fine of €182 million approximately 26 million against otis’ austrian subsidiary which fine has been fully provided for at december 31 2007 we have appealed the cartel court ruling 

  

 11  

as previously disclosed in 2005 the korean fair trade commission kftc conducted an inspection at the offices of otis korea and its three korean competitors based on the results of a subsequent internal investigation conducted by otis we believe that certain otis korea employees engaged in collusive activities in the korean market for new equipment and that certain employees also engaged in pricefixing in the market for industrial electric motors in may 2007 the kftc expanded its investigation to also focus on pricing of subcontracts for elevator installation based on its own investigation otis believes certain otis korea employees shared subcontractor pricing information with competitors in years prior to 2005 otis has fully cooperated with the kftc investigation disclosed the results of its internal investigations to the kftc and applied for leniency with respect to those disclosures in september 2007 the kftc issued its decision regarding the motor cartel and granted otis korea 100 percent leniency otis expects to receive a complaint regarding the new equipment sales investigation in the near future a complaint regarding installation subcontractor pricing may be received sometime in 2008 we do not believe that any fines that may be imposed will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows or on otis’ competitive position 

as previously disclosed class action consumer complaints have been filed against carrier in washington minnesota michigan wisconsin ontario and british columbia the complaints allege carrier engaged in deceptive and unfair trade practices by knowingly selling highefficiency condensing furnaces containing secondary heat exchangers that corrode and fail prematurely causing residential customers to incur labor costs for repair or replacement that are not covered by carrier’s warranty while carrier denies liability and disputes the claims carrier and counsel for the class action plaintiffs have reached a comprehensive agreement to settle these actions under the settlement carrier agrees to 1 extend the labor warranty on the heat exchangers for current owners of affected furnaces or provide an optional credit toward the purchase of new equipment 2 reimburse owners who have already paid for repairs to their heat exchanger and 3 pay the fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs the settlement is subject to approval by the us and canadian courts after notice to the potential class members carrier anticipates decisions by these courts during 2008 during the quarter ended december 31 2007 we recorded a reserve for the actual and estimated future costs of the settlement 

as previously disclosed like many other companies in recent years we or our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises while we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currentlymanufactured products certain of our historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos we have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date the remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to us and have been supported in part by insurance at december 31 2007 we were named in approximately 3100 lawsuits involving approximately 14400 individual claimants a substantial majority of the pending claims are in state courts in mississippi texas and new york 

except as otherwise noted above we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition a further discussion of government contracts and related investigations as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities can be found under the heading “other matters relating to our business as a whole – compliance with environmental and other government regulations” in item 1 “business” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

other 

utc power develops and markets distributed generation power systems and fuel cell power plants for stationary transportation space and defense applications utc power’s three primary distributed generation product lines purecell 200 fuel cell power plants purecomfort combined cooling heat and power systems and purecycle geothermal organic rankine cycle power systems are designed to provide reliable efficient and environmentally responsible energy solutions for customers 

utc power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane pem technology including its puremotion 120 power plant which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications utc power is currently developing pem fuel cells for submarine applications utc power’s alkalinebased fuel cells are used on nasa’s space shuttle program 

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in development and continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to advance fuel cell technology to a truly commercial stage there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced 

utc power and its related utc fuel cells unit merged effective january 1 2007 the results of utc power and utc fuel cells are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 15 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report 

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competition and other factors affecting our businesses 

as worldwide businesses our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2006 annual report in this item 1 under the heading “other matters relating to our business as a whole” in item 1a “risk factors” and in “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the united states and other countries and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service 

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aviation and rolls royce plc for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 13 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report 

research and development 

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1529 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2006 as compared with 1367 million or 32 percent of total 

  

 5  

sales in 2005 and 1267 million or 35 percent of total sales in 2004 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 1952 million in 2006 as compared with 1650 million in 2005 and 1619 million in 2004 these contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred through cost of products sold and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments of the totals 1621 million 1478 million and 1585 million were expensed in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the remaining costs have been capitalized 

us government contracts 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts while approximately 21 billion of our total sales for 2006 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and we continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report for further discussion 

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report 

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fs respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

intellectual property and raw materials 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments 

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt finland norway russia and canada tantalum australia and canada chromium south africa kazakhstan zimbabwe and russia and rhenium chile kazakhstan and germany we have a number of ongoing programs to manage 

  

 6  

this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our business or on any of our business segments for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

employees and employee relations 

at december 31 2006 our total employment was approximately 214500 approximately 66 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2006 we renegotiated twenty multiyear collective bargaining agreements the largest of which covered certain workers at sikorsky and carrier in 2007 numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation the largest of which cover certain workers at hamilton sundstrand otis and pratt  whitney we do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report 

for a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows including the risks of our international operations see the further discussion under the headings “general” and “description of business by segment” in this section and item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2006 annual report 

cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results 

this form 10k contains statements which to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the securities laws from time to time oral or written forwardlooking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public these forwardlooking statements are intended to provide management’s current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance based on assumptions currently believed to be valid forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “plans” “strategy” “prospects” “estimate” “project” “target” “anticipate” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance these include among others statements relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 7  

all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements for additional information identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements see our reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission from time to time this annual report on form 10k for 2006 includes important information as to these factors in the “business” section under the headings “general” “description of business by segment” and “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and in the “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” sections additional important information as to these factors is included in our 2006 annual report in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2006 annual report 

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries 

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated 37 percent of our revenues in 2006 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries the aviation industry is cyclical and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions worldwide airline profits and backlog levels also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2007 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing regulatory changes the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated 63 percent of our revenues in 2006 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions 

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigations including violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the us government could subject us to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages the us government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the us could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges 

  

 8  

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation 

we conduct our business on a global basis with 60 percent of our total 2006 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the united states and from us export sales fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements on nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our revenues are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or award of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china india russia and south africa that carry high levels of currency political and economic risk while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

we use a variety of raw materials supplier provided parts components subsystems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers supplier capacity constraints supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies we regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of internal and supplier produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors achieving cost and production efficiencies and validation of innovative technologies these factors involve significant risks and uncertainties we may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated in particular we cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities pratt  whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks these risks include among other things litigation concerning product liability matters personal injuries intellectual property rights government contracts taxes environmental matters compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices while we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by generally accepted accounting principles we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k

  our fixed assets as of december 31 2006 include the manufacturing facilities and nonmanufacturing facilities such as warehouses set forth in the tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations the facilities warehouses machinery and equipment in use as of december 31 2006 are in good operating condition are well maintained and substantially all are in regular use 

our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at december 31 2006 for the production of our products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products we continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and based on that review may from time to time adjust our facility needs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously reported the department of justice doj sued us in 1999 in the us district court for the southern district of ohio claiming that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law this lawsuit relates to the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and ge’s f110 engine the doj alleges that the government overpaid for f100 engines under contracts awarded by the us air force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim could be assessed if the court finds that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law damages would accrue prejudgment interest trial of this matter was completed in december 2004 at trial the government claimed pratt  whitney’s liability is 624 million we believe that this estimate is substantially overstated denied any liability and vigorously defended against the doj’s claims a decision is pending should the government ultimately prevail with respect to the foregoing government contract matter the outcome could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid however we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position cash flows or financial condition 

as previously reported the european commission’s competition directorate eu commission conducted inspections in early 2004 at offices of our otis subsidiary in berlin brussels luxembourg and paris relating to an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements involving the european elevator and escalator industry based on the results of our own internal investigation we believe that some otis employees engaged in activities at a local level in belgium luxembourg the netherlands and germany in violation of otis and utc policies and european competition law on october 13 2005 we received a statement of objections so from the eu commission relating to this investigation the so an administrative complaint alleges infringements of eu competition rules by certain elevator companies including otis in belgium luxembourg the netherlands and germany we responded to the so on february 21 2006 and have cooperated fully with the eu commission we expect the eu commission to issue a decision in the near term but cannot reasonably estimate the range of civil fines to which we or otis would likely be subject the aggregate amount of such fines could be material to our operating results for the period in which the liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which the fines would be paid we do not believe that any such fines would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on otis’ competitive position 

since the eu commission’s investigation became public class action lawsuits were filed in various federal district courts in the united states alleging that we otis and other elevator manufacturers engaged in violations of sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act those lawsuits were transferred to and consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york on june 6 2006 the district court judge granted our motion to dismiss without leave to replead on june 30 2006 the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit we expect a decision in the second or third quarter of 2007 we continue to believe this litigation is without merit 

as previously reported in december 2003 the us environmental protection agency executed a search warrant at hamilton sundstrand seeking records and data regarding processes for monitoring treating and discharging wastewater at a connecticut manufacturing facility hamilton sundstrand also received a notice of violation associated with the same matter from the connecticut department of environmental protection on february 8 2007 hamilton sundstrand pled guilty to a twocount federal criminal information alleging that it violated the clean water act by filing inaccurate reports of hexavalent chrome levels at an internal sampling point from 2001 to 2003 and by discharging wastewater containing an excessive amount of copper into the farmington river pursuant to a plea agreement hamilton sundstrand will pay a 1 million penalty and be placed on probation for a five year period over this period hamilton sundstrand will also contribute to and perform 11 million of projects to benefit the environment and take a number of actions with respect to environmental training compliance oversight reporting and auditing hamilton sundstrand also entered into a consent order with the connecticut department of environmental protection to resolve the related notice of violation under the consent order hamilton sundstrand will pay an additional 75000 fine and 675000 of the 11 million in projects described above will be designated to resolve its liability under the notice of violation 

in 2005 the korean fair trade commission conducted an inspection at the office of otis’ korean subsidiary in connection with an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements in the korean elevator industry based on the results of our internal investigation we believe that some employees at this subsidiary engaged in activities at a local level in violation of otis and utc policies and korean competition law we are cooperating fully with the investigation we do not believe that any fines that may be imposed will be material to utc or have a materially adverse impact on otis’ competitive position 

as previously reported like many other companies in recent years we or our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises while we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currently manufactured products certain of our historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos we have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date the remainder of the resolved 

  

 12  

cases have settled for amounts that are not material to us and have been supported in part by insurance at present we are named in approximately 2830 lawsuits involving approximately 15365 individual claimants in our report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2004 we reported that approximately 18000 claimants were then joined in lawsuits in mississippi state courts typically these mississippi lawsuits named from 200 to 400 other companies as defendants along with us or our subsidiaries the complaints did not identify any of our products or products of our subsidiaries or specify the amount of damages claimed in addition the complaints did not allege which claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products or premises nor the extent if any to which such claimants had been harmed since our 2004 report as a result of changes in the law governing joinder and pleading in mississippi approximately 5700 mississippi claimants have been transferred to the federal multidistrict litigation asbestos docket in pennsylvania many other claimants have been dismissed without prejudice and required to file claims if they can that allege more specifically the claimant’s exposure to asbestos and the resulting harm at present the total number of claimants in mississippi is approximately 4955 

except as otherwise noted above we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition a further discussion of government contracts and related investigations as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities can be found under the heading “other matters relating to our business as a whole – compliance with environmental and other government regulations” in item 1 “business” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

competition and other factors affecting our aerospace businesses 

  

our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services in addition the us and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales significant elements of our aerospace businesses such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand the operations of our aerospace businesses can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in “other matters relating to our business as a whole” in this section and in item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in our 2005 annual report pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are ge aircraft engines and rolls royce plc for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 14 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

other 

  

utc power develops and markets distributed power generation systems including stationary fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power cchp systems for the onsite power market commercial building applications light industrial businesses institutions office buildings and hotels use these onsite products the cchp solutions for commercial buildings are marketed as the pure comfort product family in 2004 we introduced the purecycle 200 product which utilizes an organic rankine cycle to convert waste heat into energy microturbines and organic rankine cycle devices are in an early stage of development and manufacturing continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required for widescale market acceptance 

  

utc fuel cells a part of utc power is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial transportation and space applications utc fuel cells is the sole supplier of fuel cells for us space missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant for onsite power applications known as the purecell 200 which uses proven phosphoric acid fuel cell technology in the transportation market utc fuel cells is working with automotive and bus manufacturers as well as the us government on development and demonstration programs for vehicles in 2005 utc fuel cells provided puremotion 120 fuel cell power plants for buses intended for revenue service in california utc power is actively pursuing further commercialization of these power plants utc fuel cells is also providing fuel cells to hyundai motor corporation under the us department of energy freedom car program utc power continues to work closely with many of the major automobile manufacturers to advance the technology of hydrogen fuel cell powered cars fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology pem are currently in development for transportation and onsite applications 

  

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in development and current production rates remain low across the industry continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support is needed to advance fuel cell technology to a truly commercial stage there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced 

  

the results of utc power are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

other matters relating to our business as a whole 

  

research and development 

  

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development these expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1367 million or 32 percent of total sales in 2005 as compared with 1267 million or 35 percent of total sales in 2004 and 1040 million or 34 percent of total sales in 2003 we also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers this contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 1498 million in 2005 as compared with 1619 million in 2004 and 1580 million in 2003 

  

us government contracts 

  

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers most of our us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts approximately 2 billion of our total sales for 2005 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

  

our contracts with the us government are also subject to audits like many defense contractors we have received audit reports from the us government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts we have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate have settled some allegations and we continue to litigate certain cases for further discussion of risks related to government contracting see the discussion in item 1a “risk factors” and item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k and note 15 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report for further discussion 

  

compliance with environmental and other government regulations 

  

our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 15 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

most of the us laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if we were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract we are awarded until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

  

we conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and utc fs respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses 

  

intellectual property and raw materials 

  

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and franchises related to our businesses while this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments 

  

we believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials components services and supplies used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs we pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms including consolidating our purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers like other users in the us we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as 

  

cobalt africa australia and russia tantalum australia and asia chromium africa and kazakhstan and rhenium chile and kazakhstan we have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses steel copper aluminum have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our business or on any of our business segments for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see item ia “risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

employees and employee relations 

  

at december 31 2005 our total employment was approximately 222200 approximately 67 percent of which represents employees based outside the united states during 2005 we renegotiated multiyear collective bargaining agreements covering certain workers at carrier and otis in 2006 collective bargaining agreements covering certain workers at sikorsky and carrier are subject to renegotiation for discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

for a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows including the risks of our international operations see the further discussion under the headings “general” and “description of business by segment” in this section and item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2005 annual report 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated see the discussion in “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and “cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results” in this form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the aerospace and construction industries 

  

the results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses which generated 36 percent of our revenues in 2005 are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries the aviation industry is cyclical and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including current and predicted traffic levels load factors aircraft fuel pricing labor issues competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory changes terrorism and related safety concerns general economic conditions worldwide airline profits and backlog levels also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2006 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled in addition our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts the defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment continued pressure on us and global defense spending and us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors including usage pricing regulatory changes the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete a reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations 

  

the results of our commercial and industrial businesses which generated 64 percent of our revenues in 2005 are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity interest rates labor costs foreign currency exchange rates customer attrition raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors in addition to these factors carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and in its residential business weather conditions in seasonal periods 

  

our business may be affected by government contracting risks 

  

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the government as a result of 

  

our default we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are now and believe that in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more us government investigations if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any us government investigations including violation of certain environmental or export laws we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable we could be subject to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the us government the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the us could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges 

  

our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulation 

  

we conduct our business on a global basis with 61 percent of our total 2005 segment revenues including us export sales derived from operations outside of the united states fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our nonus operations primarily the commercial businesses where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements on nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our revenues are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries for example as a condition of sale or to the awarding of a contract some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements which may include incountry purchases manufacturing and financial support arrangements the contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including argentina brazil china russia and south africa which carry high levels of currency political and economic risk while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

  

we use a variety of raw materials in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

  

our reliance on foreign suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials in some instances we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses and cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our operating results 

  

our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by gaap we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid for a description of current legal proceedings see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

none 

  

cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results 

  

this form 10k contains statements which to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the securities laws from time to time oral or written forwardlooking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public these forwardlooking statements are intended to provide management’s current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance based on assumptions currently believed to be valid forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “plans” “strategy” “prospects” “estimate” “project” “target” “anticipate” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance these include among others statements relating to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements for additional information identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements see our reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission from time to time this annual report on form 10k for 2005 includes important information as to these factors in the “business” section under the headings “general” “description of business by segment” and “other matters relating to our business as a whole” and in the “risk factors” and “legal proceedings” sections additional important information as to these factors is included in our 2005 annual report in the section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

our fixed assets as of december 31 2005 include the plants and warehouses set forth in the table below and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations the plants warehouses machinery and equipment in use as of december 31 2005 are in good operating condition are well maintained and substantially all are in regular use 

  

     

for discussion of the effect of our restructuring actions on production facilities see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 11 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” in our 2005 annual report 

  

our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at december 31 2005 for the production of our products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products we continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and based on that review may from time to time adjust our facility needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

as previously reported we are in litigation with the department of defense dod as to whether pratt  whitney’s government cost accounting practices for engine parts produced by foreign companies under commercial engine collaboration programs since 1984 are acceptable in 2001 the armed services board of contract appeals asbca ruled in our favor but the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed in 2003 and remanded the case to the asbca to determine the appropriate accounting the us supreme court declined to review that decision in november 2003 the dod supplemented its claim to add damages and interest for the period after 1996 bringing dod’s claim to approximately 367 million in damages through 2002 and approximately 388 million in interest through 2001 our appeal of this supplemental claim has been consolidated with the original matter 

  

as previously reported the department of justice doj sued us in 1999 in the us district court for the southern district of ohio claiming that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law this lawsuit relates to the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and ge’s f110 engine the doj alleges that the government overpaid for f100 engines under contracts awarded by the us air force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim could be assessed if the court finds that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law damages would accrue prejudgment interest trial of this matter was completed in december 2004 at trial the government claimed pratt  whitney’s liability is 624 million we believe that this estimate is substantially overstated denied any liability and vigorously defended against the doj’s claims a decision is expected in 2006 

  

should the government ultimately prevail with respect to either of the foregoing government contract matters discussed above the outcome could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid however we do not believe that resolution of any of these government contracting matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations or financial condition 

  

as previously reported a qui tam relator filed a complaint in july 1997 against us and our subsidiary norden systems inc in the us district court in connecticut  us ex rel drake v norden systems inc and utc  no 394cv00963 alleging that we and norden are liable under the civil false claims act for violating us government rules on accounting for fixed assets the qui tam relator claimed unspecified damages and penalties the doj declined to intervene in february 2003 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution and the relator appealed in july 2004 the us court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the dismissal of the claims against us but remanded certain of the claims against norden back to the district court for further proceedings the civil false claims act provides for treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim submitted to the us government the number of false claims if any implicated by the remaining claims cannot currently be ascertained however if determined adversely to norden the number could result in significant damages and penalties which we might be required to pay we believe the claims against norden are without merit and continue to defend this matter vigorously 

  

as previously reported the european commission’s competition directorate the “eu commission” conducted inspections in early 2004 at offices of our otis subsidiary in berlin brussels luxembourg and paris relating to an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements involving the european elevator and escalator industry based on the results of our own internal investigation we believe that some otis employees engaged in activities at a local level in belgium luxembourg the netherlands and germany in violation of otis and utc policies and european competition law on october 13 2005 we received a statement of objections from the eu commission relating to this investigation the statement of objections an administrative complaint alleges infringements of eu competition rules by certain elevator companies including otis in belgium luxembourg the netherlands and germany we are carefully reviewing the statement of objections and will respond timely to the eu commission as we have from the start we continue to cooperate fully with the eu commission as previously disclosed we believe it is still too early in the eu commission’s investigation for us to reasonably estimate the range of civil fines to which we or otis would likely be subject the aggregate amount of such fines if ultimately imposed could be material to our operating results for the period in which the liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which the fines would be paid we do not believe that any such fines would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on otis’ competitive position 

  

since the eu commission’s investigation became public class action lawsuits have been filed in various federal district courts in the united states alleging that we otis and other elevator manufacturers engaged in violations of sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act those lawsuits have been transferred to and consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york the lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages claimed we believe that these lawsuits are the result of press reports about the eu commission’s investigation we believe that the lawsuits are devoid of merit and will defend them vigorously 

  

as previously reported in december 2003 the us environmental protection agency epa executed a search warrant at hamilton sundstrand seeking records and data regarding the processes for monitoring treating testing and discharging wastewater at hamilton sundstrand’s windsor locks connecticut manufacturing facility hamilton sundstrand has also received a notice of violation associated with the same matter from the connecticut department of environmental protection several employees have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury and hamilton sundstrand also received subpoenas for records with the assistance of independent consultants hamilton sundstrand has reviewed the operations of the wastewater treatment facility modified the physical plant and improved operating procedures hamilton sundstrand continues to cooperate with federal and state officials in the investigation 

  

as previously reported in the third quarter of 2004 carrier reached an agreement with the epa to resolve its current liability at the puente valley operable unit superfund site in california in august 2005 the agreement was finalized and incorporated in a proposed consent decree that is pending approval by the us district court for the central district of california under this proposed consent decree carrier would pay approximately 125000 and undertake an environmental project for approximately 500000 in settlement of claims for civil penalties related to alleged noncompliance with an administrative order in addition carrier would pay a portion of the epa’s unreimbursed past costs for the site and undertake a portion of the interim remedy epa selected for the site management believes that these costs are adequately reserved for within the total amount reserved for environmental remediation noted under the heading “environmental matters” in our 2005 annual report and that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position financial position or results of operations 

  

the korean fair trade commission recently conducted an inspection at the office of otis’ korean subsidiary in connection with an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements in the korean elevator industry based on the 

  

results of our internal investigation we believe that some employees at this subsidiary engaged in activities at a local level in violation of otis and utc policies and korean competition law we are cooperating fully with the investigation we do not believe that any fines that may be imposed will be material to utc or have a materially adverse impact on otis’ competitive position 

  

as previously reported like many other companies in recent years we or our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises while we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currently manufactured products certain of our historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos we have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date the remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to us and have been supported in part by insurance at present we are named in approximately 2270 lawsuits involving approximately 20100 individual claimants in our report on form 10k for the year period ended december 31 2004 we reported that approximately 18000 were then joined in lawsuits in mississippi state courts typically these mississippi lawsuits named from 200 to 400 other companies as defendants along with us or our subsidiaries the complaints did not identify any of our products or products of our subsidiaries or specify the amount of damages claimed in addition the complaints did not allege which claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products or premises nor the extent if any to which such claimants had been harmed since our previous report as a result of changes in the law governing joinder and pleading in mississippi approximately 5700 mississippi claimants have been transferred to the federal multidistrict litigation asbestos docket in pennsylvania many other claimants have been dismissed without prejudice and required to file claims if they can that allege more specifically the claimant’s exposure to asbestos and the resulting harm at present the total number of claimants in mississippi is approximately 6300 

  

except as otherwise noted above we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition a further discussion of government contracts and related investigations as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities can be found under the heading “other matters relating to our business as a whole – compliance with environmental and other government regulations” in item 1 “business” and in item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

utc’s aerospace and defense products 

  

utc’s aerospace and defense businesses pratt  whitney hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are general electric company ge and rolls royce plc for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements in utc’s 2004 annual report 

  

other factors that can affect the results of utc’s aerospace and defense businesses include lengthy and costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the us and other countries us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations the us and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales the operations of pratt  whitney hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in utc’s 2004 annual report and those described in this section under the heading “other matters relating to utc’s business as a whole” 

  

significant elements of the business of pratt  whitney hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2005 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled

utc power develops and markets distributed power generation systems including fuel cells and microturbines for use in commercial applications transportation and light industrial businesses institutions and office buildings utc power integrates sells and services microturbinebased combined heat and power chp solutions for commercial buildings including its pure comfort tm product family in 2004 the company introduced the purecycle tm 200 product which utilizes an organic rankine cycle to convert waste heat into energy microturbines and organic rankine cycle devices are in an early stage of development and manufacturing continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required for widescale market acceptance 

  

utc fuel cells a part of utc power is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial transportation and space applications utc fuel cells is the sole supplier of fuel cells for us space missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant known as the purecell tm 200 fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology pem are currently in development for transportation and stationary applications utc fuel cells is working with automakers and bus manufacturers as well as the us government on development and demonstration programs for vehicles since 2002 utc fuel cells has been participating in licensing and joint development arrangements with nissan motor company and hyundai motor company in october 2003 nissan unveiled its zeroemission fuel cell vehicle powered by a utc fuel cells power plant hyundai and utc fuel cells have integrated a fuel cell power plant capable of operating in freezing conditions into a hyundai sports utility vehicle platform hyundai plans to lease a number of such vehicles to fleet operators in 2005 as part of the us department of energy’s freedom car program funding for the freedom car program is currently under consideration by the us congress and annual appropriations will be required to support the full objectives of the program 

  

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in development and current production rates remain low across the industry continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support for fuel cells is expected to impact the advancement of the technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced in november 2004 utc fuel cells announced a restructuring of its relationship with toshiba corporation under the terms of utc’s agreement with toshiba corporation utc fuel cells purchased the 10 equity interest toshiba held in utc fuel cells and toshiba purchased utc fuel cells’ 49 interest in toshiba international fuel cells joint development of pem technology will continue under the agreement which includes crosslicensing provisions 

  

the results of utc power are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements in utc’s 2004 annual report 

  

other matters relating to utc’s business as a whole 

  

research and development 

  

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on utc’s operations and competitive position utc spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development such expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1256 million or 34 percent of total sales in 2004 as compared with 1027 million or 33 percent of total sales in 2003 and 1191 million or 43 percent of total sales in 2002 utc also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers such contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the hamilton sundstrand and sikorsky segments amounted to 1619 million in 2004 as compared with 1580 million in 2003 and 1189 million in 2002 

  

contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters 

  

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default by utc for failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience utc normally is entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government for default by utc utc could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages suffered by the government most of utc’s us government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts approximately 2 billion of utc’s total sales for 2004 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

  

utc is now and believes that in light of the current us government contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more us government investigations see item 3 – legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in utc’s 2004 annual report for further discussion if utc or one of its business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations or other us government investigations including violation of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable utc could be subject to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the us government the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not 

  

exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the us could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of utc’s export privileges 

  

utc’s contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many defense contractors utc has received audit reports from the us government which recommend that certain contract prices be reduced because cost or pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have been in conformance with government regulations some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts utc has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes appropriate has settled some allegations and continues to litigate certain cases see item 3 – legal proceedings in this form 10k and note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in utc’s 2004 annual report for further discussion 

  

utc conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide some of which have significant minority interests changes in legislation or government policies can have an impact on utc’s worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards elevator safety codes and fire protection regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and chubb respectively while government safety and performance regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact utc’s aerospace and defense businesses 

  

utc’s international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings some foreign customers in utc’s aerospace and defense businesses may require counterpurchase or offset arrangements as a condition to a sale such as requiring utc to purchase supplies in the customer’s country or to participate in manufacturing and financial support projects 

  

utc’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations utc has incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment utc does not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements in utc’s 2004 annual report 

  

most of the laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if utc were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract awarded to utc until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

  

while utc’s patents trademarks licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to its business utc does not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of utc or on any of its operating segments 

  

utc continuously seeks to reduce the cost of its purchases of materials components services and supplies these cost reductions may be achieved through a number of mechanisms including consolidating its purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers greater dependence on global sources of supply requires reliable transportation and import and export processes utc is reliant on commodity markets and its results can be affected by commodity pricing in some instances utc depends upon a single source of supply or participates in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers a disruption in deliveries from utc’s suppliers therefore could have an adverse effect on utc’s ability to meet its commitments to customers like other users in the us utc is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials requirements such as cobalt africa australia and russia tantalum australia and asia chromium africa and kazakhstan and rhenium chile and kazakhstan utc has a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes utc believes that its supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the associated risks and the additional cost of alternative practices although high prices for some raw materials important to some of utc’s businesses particularly carrier copper steel aluminum have caused pricing pressures utc does not foresee any unavailability of materials components or supplies that will have any material adverse effect on its overall business or on any of its business segments in the near term

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

as previously reported the department of defense dod and utc are litigating whether pratt  whitney’s government cost accounting practices for certain engine parts are acceptable the litigation filed in 1994 with the armed services board of contract appeals asbca no 47416 et al relates to the accounting for engine parts produced by foreign companies under commercial engine collaboration programs since 1984 on july 31 2001 the asbca issued a decision in favor of utc the dod appealed this decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit on november 29 2001 on january 15 2003 the court of appeals reversed the asbca and remanded the case to the asbca for further proceedings utc sought review by the us supreme court which was denied on november 10 2003 on november 24 2003 the dod supplemented its original claim to add damages and interest for the period after 1996 the dod’s claim now totals approximately 367 million in damages through 2002 and approximately 388 million in interest through 2001 utc has appealed this supplemental claim to the asbca 

  

as previously reported the department of justice doj filed a complaint under the civil false claims act and related common law theories in march 1999 against utc in the us district court for the southern district of ohio this lawsuit relates to 

  

the “fighter engine competition” between pratt  whitney’s f100 engine and ge’s f110 engine for contracts awarded by the us air force between fiscal years 1985 and 1990 inclusive the doj alleges that the government overpaid for engines because pratt  whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements as previously reported the doj amended its complaint in september 2003 to allege damages in excess of 141 million and to add an additional allegation without quantifying damages treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim could be assessed if the court finds that pratt  whitney violated the civil false claims act and common law damages would accrue prejudgment interest on may 28 2004 a government report estimated pratt  whitney’s liability at 624 million utc believes that this estimate is substantially overstated denies any liability and is vigorously defending the doj’s claims trial of this matter was completed in december 2004 and a decision is expected in 2005 

  

as previously reported a qui tam relator filed a complaint in july 1997 against utc and its subsidiary norden systems inc in the us district court in connecticut  us ex rel drake v norden systems inc and utc  no 394cv00963 alleging that utc and norden are liable under the civil false claims act for violating us government rules on accounting for fixed assets the qui tam relator claimed unspecified damages and penalties the doj declined to intervene in february 2003 the district court granted utc’s motion to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution and the relator appealed in july 2004 the us court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the dismissal of the claims against utc but remanded certain of the claims against norden back to the district court for further proceedings the civil false claims act provides for treble damages and penalties of up to 10000 per false claim submitted to the government the number of false claims if any implicated by the remaining claims cannot currently be ascertained however if determined adversely to norden the number could result in significant damages and penalties which utc might be required to pay utc believes the claims against norden are without merit and intends to continue to defend this matter vigorously 

  

as previously reported the european commission’s competition directorate conducted inspections in early 2004 at offices of utc’s otis subsidiary in berlin brussels luxembourg and paris the inspections relate to the commission’s ongoing investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements involving the elevator and escalator industry in europe utc is cooperating fully with the commission’s investigation based on the results of its own internal investigation utc believes that some otis employees in limited european locations engaged in activities at a local level in violation of otis and utc policies and may have violated applicable competition law it is still too early in the commission’s investigation for utc to reasonably estimate the range of civil fines to which it would likely be subject the aggregate amount of such fines if ultimately imposed could be material to utc’s operating results for the period in which the liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which the fines would be paid utc does not believe that any such fines would have a material adverse effect on utc’s financial condition or that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on otis’ competitive position 

  

since the commission’s investigation became public and utc announced the preliminary results of its internal investigation class action lawsuits have been filed in various federal district courts in the united states naming utc otis and others as defendants and alleging a worldwide agreement among elevator and escalator manufacturers to fix prices in violation of the sherman act those lawsuits have now been transferred to and consolidated in the southern district of new york the lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages claimed utc believes that these lawsuits are the result of press reports about the commission’s investigation utc believes that the lawsuits are devoid of merit and will defend them vigorously 

  

as previously reported like many other companies in recent years utc or its subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of utc’s products or premises while utc has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it in any currentlymanufactured products certain of its historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos utc has made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date the remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to utc and have been supported in part by insurance at present utc is named in approximately 1700 lawsuits involving approximately 25000 individual claimants approximately 18000 of these claimants are joined in lawsuits in mississippi state courts typically these mississippi lawsuits name from 200 to more than 400 other companies as defendants along with utc or its subsidiaries the complaints do not identify any products of utc or its named subsidiaries or specify the amount of damages claimed in addition the complaints do not allege which claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to utc’s products or premises nor the extent if any to which such claimants have been harmed discovery has begun in some of the cases but to date there has been only minimal product identification 

  

as previously reported on december 16 2003 the us environmental protection agency epa executed a search warrant at hamilton sundstrand the search warrant issued by the us district court for the district of connecticut sought records and data regarding the company’s processes for monitoring treating testing and discharging wastewater at hamilton sundstrand’s windsor locks connecticut manufacturing facility hamilton sundstrand has also received a notice of violation associated with the same matter from the connecticut department of environmental protection several employees have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury and hamilton sundstrand also received subpoenas for records with the assistance of independent consultants 

  

hamilton sundstrand has reviewed the operations of the wastewater treatment facility has made modifications to the physical plant and has improved operating procedures hamilton sundstrand continues to cooperate with federal and state officials in the investigation 

  

as previously reported carrier corporation has reached an agreement in principle with the epa to resolve its current liability at the puente valley operable unit superfund site in california under the proposed agreement carrier would pay approximately 125000 and undertake an environmental project for approximately 500000 in settlement of claims for civil penalties related to alleged noncompliance with an administrative order in addition carrier would pay a portion of the epa’s unreimbursed past costs for the site and undertake a portion of the interim remedy epa selected for the site management believes that these costs are adequately reserved for within the total amount reserved for environmental remediation noted under the heading “environmental matters” in utc’s 2004 annual report utc expects the proposed agreement with the epa to be finalized in a consent decree subject to approval by the us district court for the central district of california which is expected in the first half of 2005 management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon utc’s competitive position financial position or results of operations 

  

should the government ultimately prevail with respect to one or more of the significant government contract matters discussed above the outcome could result in a material effect on utc’s results of operations in the period the matter is resolved however utc does not believe that resolution of any of the government contracting matters discussed above or any other legal matters will have a material adverse effect upon utc’s competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition a further discussion of government contracts and related investigations as well as a discussion of utc’s environmental liabilities can be found under the heading “other matters relating to utc’s business as a whole – contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters” in item 1 – business in this form 10k

sikorsky is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of military and commercial helicopters and is the primary supplier of utility helicopters to the us army and navy sikorsky also supplies helicopters to foreign governments and the worldwide commercial market sikorsky’s aftermarket business which includes spare parts sales overhaul and repair and service contracts for helicopters and other aircraft has become a more significant part of sikorsky’s business in recent years during 2002 sikorsky acquired derco holding a supplier of military aircraft logistics and component distribution component repairs and aftermarket program management 

  

current production programs at sikorsky include the black hawk mediumtransport helicopter for the us and foreign governments the mh60s helicopter for the us navy the international naval hawk for multiple naval missions the s76 helicopter for commercial operations and beginning in 2003 the s92 helicopter for commercial operations under a multiyear contract signed with the us government in 2002 sikorsky has contracted to deliver 98 army black hawk and 82 navy mh60s helicopters through june 2007 under a 238 million research development and test contract sikorsky is performing work to evaluate the potential for upgrading the us army fleet of black hawk helicopters

sikorsky launched production of the s92 helicopter in early 2003 for the commercial market a portion of the development and production of the s92 is being performed in collaboration with companies in brazil the people’s republic of china japan spain and taiwan deliveries of the s92 will begin in 2004 management cannot predict with certainty in what quantities the s92 helicopter will be produced variants of the s92 for military markets are currently in development including a bid to provide the new us presidential helicopter management cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities such helicopters will be produced 

  

sikorsky has a 50 percent interest in a joint venture with boeing for the development of the rah66 comanche light attack and reconnaissance helicopter the joint venture is performing under a cost reimbursement contract awarded by the us army in 2000 in november 2002 the us army awarded the joint venture a revised engineering and manufacturing development contract that increased the contract value by 34 billion to 66 billion under the revised contract the joint venture is required to deliver nine comanche helicopters in 2005 and 2006 for test and evaluation purposes and to provide aircraft capability improvements through 2011 management cannot predict with certainty whether when and in what quantities comanche helicopters will be produced 

  

revenues generated by the flight systems segment’s international operations including export sales were 35 percent and 40 percent of total flight systems segment revenues in 2003 and 2002 respectively at december 31 2003 flight systems’ business backlog was 4271 million including 2347 million under funded contracts and subcontracts with the us government as compared to 3642 million and 1839 million respectively at december 31 2002 of the total flight systems segment backlog at december 31 2003 approximately 3429 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2004 

  

pratt  whitney and flight systems aerospace and defense products 

  

the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are general electric company “ge” and rolls royce plc for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 24 to 25 and 36 of the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners 

  

other factors that can affect the results of the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses include lengthy and costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the us and other countries us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations military spare parts sales are affected by policies of the us and other governments of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer pratt  whitney’s and flight systems’ operations can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners and those described in the “business” section of this form 10k under the heading “other matters relating to the corporation’s business as a whole” 

  

significant elements of pratt  whitney’s and flight systems’ business such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2004 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled

utc fuel cells a part of utc power is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial transportation and space applications utc fuel cells is the sole supplier of fuel cells for us space missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant known as the purecell tm 200 formerly known as the pc25 tm  more than 260 purecell tm 200 units have been delivered around the world fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology “pem” are currently in development for transportation and stationary applications utc fuel cells is working with automakers and bus manufacturers as well as the us government on development and demonstration programs for vehicles in december 2002 utc fuel cells signed an agreement to license its pem technology on a nonexclusive basis to nissan motor company ltd “nissan” and to engage in joint development of this technology for automotive applications in october 2003 nissan unveiled its second generation zeroemission fuel cell vehicle powered by a utc fuel cells power plant in june 2003 utc fuel cells announced an agreement with hyundai motor co “hyundai” a partner with utc fuel cells since 2000 to jointly develop a new automotive fuel cell power plant capable of operating in freezing conditions hyundai and utc fuel cells intend to integrate the power plants into a new hyundai sports utility vehicle platform hyundai plans to lease a number of such vehicles to fleet operators in 2004 

  

although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics the technology is still in development and current production rates remain low across the industry continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve widescale market acceptance government support for fuel cells is expected to impact the advancement of the technology there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced toshiba corporation owns a 10 percent equity interest in utc fuel cells 

  

the results of utc power are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 37 through 39 of the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners 

  

other matters relating to the corporation’s business as a whole 

  

research and development 

  

since changes in technology can have a significant impact on the corporation’s operations and competitive position the corporation spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development such expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1027 million or 33 percent of total sales in 2003 as compared with 1191 million or 43 percent of total sales in 2002 and 1254 million or 46 percent of total sales in 2001 the corporation also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers such contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the flight systems segment amounted to 1580 million in 2003 as compared with 1189 million in 2002 and 846 million in 2001 

  

contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters 

  

us government contracts are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for default by the corporation for failure to perform under the applicable contract in the case of a termination for convenience the corporation normally is entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus termination costs and a reasonable profit if terminated by the government for default by the corporation the corporation could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages suffered by the government most of the corporation’s government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts approximately 20 billion of the corporation’s total sales for 2003 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

  

the corporation is now and believes that in light of the current government contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more government investigations see item 3 – legal proceedings on pages 9 through 10 of this form 10k and note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 36 of the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners for further discussion if the corporation or one of its business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations or other government investigations including violation of certain environmental or export laws it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the corporation could be subject to fines penalties repayments and treble and other damages any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the us government the us government also reserves the rights to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct debarment generally does not exceed three years independently failure to comply with us laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the us could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of the corporation’s export privileges 

  

the corporation’s contracts with the us government are subject to audits like many defense contractors the corporation has received audit reports from the us government which recommend that certain contract prices be reduced because cost or pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have been in conformance with government regulations some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts the corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes appropriate has settled some allegations and continues to litigate certain cases see item 3 – legal proceedings on pages 9 through 10 of this form 10k and note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 36 of the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners for further discussion 

  

 6  

the corporation conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide some of which have significant minority interests changes in legislation or government policies can have an impact on the corporation’s worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants elevator safety codes and fire protection regulations are important to the businesses of carrier otis and chubb respectively while government safety regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses 

  

the corporation’s international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings some foreign customers in the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses may require counterpurchase or offset arrangements as a condition to a sale such as requiring the corporation to purchase supplies in the customer’s country or to participate in manufacturing and financial support projects 

  

the corporation’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations the corporation has incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment the corporation does not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 13 and notes 1 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 22 and 36 of the corporation’s 2003 annual report to shareowners 

  

most of the laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if the corporation were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract awarded to the corporation until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

  

while the corporation’s patents trademarks licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to its business the corporation does not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of the corporation or on any of its operating segments 

  

the corporation continuously seeks to reduce the cost of its purchases of materials components services and supplies these cost reductions may be achieved through a number of mechanisms including consolidating its purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers greater dependence on global sources of supply requires reliable transportation and import and export processes in some instances the corporation is reliant upon a single source of supply or participates in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by the suppliers a disruption in deliveries from its suppliers therefore could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s ability to meet its commitments to customers like other users in the us the corporation is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials requirements such as cobalt africa australia and russia tantalum australia and asia chromium africa and kazakhstan and rhenium chile and kazakhstan the corporation has a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including longterm agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes the corporation believes that its supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the associated risks and the additional cost of other practices the corporation does not foresee any unavailability of materials components or supplies that will have any material adverse effect on its overall business or on any of its business segments in the near term

like many other companies in recent years the corporation or its subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of the corporation’s products or premises while the corporation has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it in any currentlymanufactured products certain of its historical products like those of many other manufacturers have contained components incorporating asbestos the corporation has made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date the remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to the corporation and have been supported in part by insurance at present the corporation is named in approximately 1500 lawsuits involving approximately 24000 individual claimants more than 21000 of these claimants are joined in lawsuits in mississippi state courts typically these mississippi lawsuits name from 200 to more than 400 other companies as defendants along with the corporation or its subsidiaries the complaints do not identify any products of the corporation or its named subsidiaries or specify the amount of damages claimed in addition the complaints do not allege which claimants if any were exposed to asbestos attributable to the corporation’s products or premises nor the extent if any to which such claimants have been harmed discovery has begun in some of the larger cases but to date there has been only minimal product identification 

  

on december 16 2003 the us environmental protection agency “epa” executed a search warrant at hamilton sundstrand the search warrant issued by the us district court for the district of connecticut sought records and data regarding the company’s processes for monitoring treating testing and discharging wastewater at the company’s windsor locks connecticut manufacturing facility the company also has received a notice of violation associated with the same matter from the connecticut department of environmental protection several employees have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury and the company also received a subpoena for records the company is conducting its own investigation and is cooperating with federal and state officials in the investigation

pratt  whitney and flight systems aerospace and defense products the corporations aerospace and defense businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services pratt  whitneys major competitors in the sale of engines are general electric company and rolls royce plc for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 22 through 23 and 30 through 31 of the corporations 2002 annual report to shareowners 

  other factors that can affect the results of the corporations aerospace and defense businesses include lengthy and costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the us and other countries us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations military spare parts sales are affected by policies of the us and other governments of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer pratt  whitneys and flight systems operations can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations 2002 annual report to shareowners and those described in the business section of this form 10k under the heading other matters relating to the corporations business as a whole 

  significant elements of pratt  whitneys and flight systems business such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2003 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled

other matters relating to the corporations business as a whole 

research and development since changes in technology can have a significant impact on the corporations operations and competitive position the corporation spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development such expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1191 million or 43 percent of total sales in 2002 as compared with 1254 million or 46 percent of total sales in 2001 and 1302 million or 50 percent of total sales in 2000 the corporation also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers such contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the flight systems segment amounted to 1189 million in 2002 as compared with 846 million in 2001 and 865 million in 2000 

contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters us government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the us government in which event the corporation normally would be entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus a reasonable profit most of the corporations government sales are made under fixedprice type contracts approximately 16 billion of the corporations total sales for 2002 were made under costreimbursement type contracts 

  like many defense contractors the corporation has received allegations from the us government that some contract prices should be reduced because cost or pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices may not have been in conformance with government regulations the corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes appropriate has settled some allegations and does not believe that any further price reductions that may be required will have a material effect upon its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  the corporation is now and believes that in light of the current government contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more government investigations see item 3  legal proceedings on pages 8 through 9 of this form 10k and note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 31 of the corporations 2002 annual report to shareowners for further discussion if the corporation or one of its business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the corporation could be fined and debarred from new government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the government 

  the corporation conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide some of which have significant minority interests changes in legislation or government policies can have an impact on the corporations worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants is important to carriers businesses while government safety regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact the corporations aerospace and defense businesses the corporations international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings some foreign customers in the corporations aerospace and defense businesses may require counterpurchase or offset arrangements as a condition to a sale such as requiring the corporation to purchase supplies in the customers country or to participate in manufacturing and financial support projects 

  the corporations operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations the corporation has incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment the corporation does not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 11 and notes 1 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 21 and 31 of the corporations 2002 annual report to shareowners 

  most of the laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if the corporation were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract awarded to the corporation until the environmental protection agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected 

  while the corporations patents trademarks licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to its business the corporation does not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of the corporation or on any of its operating segments 

  the corporation has sought cost reductions in its purchases of materials components and supplies these cost reductions may be achieved through a number of mechanisms including consolidating its purchases reducing the number of suppliers strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances the corporation is reliant upon a single source of supply greater dependence on global sources of supply requires reliable transportation and import and export processes a disruption in deliveries from its suppliers therefore could have an adverse effect on the corporations ability to meet its commitments to customers like other users in the us the corporation is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials requirements such as cobalt africa australia and russia tantalum australia and asia chromium africa and kazakhstan and rhenium chile and kazakhstan to alleviate this dependence and accompanying risk associated with these particular raw materials the corporation has a number of ongoing programs which include the increased use of more readily available materials through material substitutions and the development of new alloys and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes such as near net shape forging the corporation believes that its supply management practices in general are based on an appropriate balancing of the associated risks and the additional cost of other practices the corporation does not foresee any unavailability of materials components or supplies that will have any material adverse effect on its overall business or on any of its business segments in the near term

pratt  whitney and flight systems aerospace and defense products 

  the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts in particular pratt  whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframeengine combinations manufacturers of many aircraft offer their customers a choice of engines at the time of sale of aircraft as a result engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements pratt  whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are general electric company and rolls royce plc the initial selections of engines and other components by manufacturers and purchasers of new aircraft can also have a significant impact on later sales of spare parts and maintenance services in addition to the terms and conditions of sale mentioned above the principal methods of competition in the pratt  whitney and flight systems segments are price product performance service and delivery schedule for information regarding customer financing commitments participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees see notes 4 and 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 17 and 24 of the corporations 2001 annual report to shareowners 

  other factors that can affect the results of the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses include lengthy and costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the us and other countries us foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations military spare parts sales are affected by policies of the us and other governments of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer pratt  whitney’s and flight systems’ operations can also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial position included in the corporation’s 2001 annual report to shareowners and those described in the business section of this form 10k under the heading “other matters relating to the corporation’s business as a whole” 

  significant elements of pratt  whitneys and flight systems’ business such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have short lead times therefore backlog information may not be indicative of future demand also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2002 changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled 

other 

  utc fuel cells llc “utc fuel cells” is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial transportation residential and space applications utc fuel cells is the sole supplier of fuel cells for us space missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant known as the pc25™ over 245 pc25 units have been delivered around the world fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology pem are currently in development for transportation commercial stationary and residential applications utc fuel cells is working with automakers and bus manufacturers as well as the us department of energy on development and demonstration programs for automobiles in 2001 utc fuel cells and shell hydrogen us formed a joint venture to develop manufacture and sell fuel processors and hydrogen generation systems 

  although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generators in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics current production rates remain low across the industry continued technology advancement and wider market acceptance are required to reduce the production cost of fuel cell components and power plants there is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be produced utc fuel cells continues to seek strategic partners to develop sources of supply as well as marketing and distribution channels toshiba corporation owns a 10 percent equity interest in utc fuel cells 

  the results of utc fuel cells are included in the “eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 24 to 25 of the corporation’s 2001 annual report to shareowners

  other matters relating to the corporations business as a whole   

research and development 

  since changes in technology can have a significant impact on the corporation’s operations and competitive position the corporation spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development such expenditures which are charged to expense as incurred were 1254 million or 46 percent of total sales in 2001 as compared with 1302 million or 50 percent of total sales in 2000 and 1292 million or 54 percent of total sales in 1999 the corporation also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the us government and other customers such contract research and development which is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the flight systems segment amounted to 845 million in 2001 as compared with 866 million in 2000 and 963 million in 1999 

contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters 

  us government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the us government in which event the corporation normally would be entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus a reasonable profit most of the corporations sales are made under fixedprice type contracts approximately 11 billion of the corporations total sales for 2001 were made under costreimbursement type contracts

  like many defense contractors the corporation has received allegations from the us government that some contract prices should be reduced because cost or pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices may not have been in conformance with government regulations the corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes appropriate has settled some allegations and does not believe that any further price reductions that may be required will have a material effect upon its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  the corporation is now and believes that in light of the current government contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more government investigations see item 3  legal proceedings on page 8 of this form 10k and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 24 of the corporation’s 2001 annual report to shareowners for further discussion if the corporation or one of its business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings if convicted or found liable the corporation could be fined and debarred from new government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the government 

  the corporation conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide some of which have significant minority interests changes in legislation or government policies can have an impact on the corporation’s worldwide operations for example governmental regulation of refrigerants is important to carrier’s businesses while government safety regulations restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses the corporation’s international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to investments exchange controls and repatriation of earnings some foreign customers in the corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses may require counterpurchase or offset arrangements as a condition to a sale such as requiring the corporation to purchase supplies in the customer’s country or to participate in manufacturing and financial support projects 

  the corporations operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations the corporation has incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment the corporation does not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows competitive position financial position or results of operations environmental matters are further addressed in managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial position on page 8 and notes 1 and 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 16 and 24 of the corporations 2001 annual report to shareowners

  most of the laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions if the corporation were convicted of a violation of the federal clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any us government contract awarded to the corporation until the environmental protection agency certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected 

 6  

  while the corporations patents trademarks licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to its business the corporation does not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of the corporation or on any of its operating segments 

  like other users in the us the corporation is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials requirements such as cobalt africa tantalum australia and chile and chromium africa eastern and central europe and the countries of the former soviet union to alleviate this dependence and accompanying risk the corporation has a number of ongoing programs which include the development of new suppliers the increased use of more readily available materials through material substitutions and the development of new alloys and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes such as net shape forging 

  the corporation has sought cost reductions in its purchases of certain other materials components and supplies by consolidating its purchases reducing the number of suppliers and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers in some instances the corporation is reliant upon a single source of supply a disruption in deliveries from its suppliers therefore could have an adverse effect on the corporations ability to meet its commitments to customers the corporation believes that it has appropriately balanced the risks against the costs of sustaining a greater number of suppliers the corporation does not foresee any unavailability of materials components or supplies which will have any material adverse effect on its overall business or on any of its business segments in the near term 

  for a discussion of other risks to which the corporation’s financial position results of operations or cash flows may be subject including the risks of the corporation’s international operations see the business section of this form 10k under the heading description of business by segment and management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial position appearing on pages 1 through 9 of the corporation’s 2001 annual report to shareowners

an 80 percent equity interest in lgotis elevator company

   revenues generated by otis international operations were 77 and 78 percent
of total otis segment revenues in 2000 and 1999 respectively  at december 31
2000 otis business backlog was 3770 million as compared to 3782 million
at december 31 1999  substantially all of the business backlog at december 31
2000 is expected to be realized as sales in 2001

carrier
   carrier is the worlds largest manufacturer of commercial and residential
heating ventilating and air conditioning systems and equipment  carrier is
also a leading producer of commercial and transport refrigeration equipment and
provides aftermarket service and components for its products and those of other
manufacturers  the products manufactured by carrier include chillers and

residential and light commercial heating and air conditioning equipment by
acquiring international comfort products corporation

   in february 2000 carrier expanded its european commercial refrigeration
operations by acquiring the electrolux groups commercial refrigeration
business  in november 2000 carrier acquired specialty equipment companies a
manufacturer of commercial refrigeration and food service equipment in the
united states and europe

   revenues generated by carriers international operations including us
export sales were 48 percent of total carrier segment revenues in each of 2000
and 1999  at december 31 2000 carriers business backlog was 1004 million
as compared to 978 million at december 31 1999  substantially all of the
business backlog at december 31 2000 is expected to be realized as sales in
2001

otis and carrier worldwide operations
   otis and carrier conduct their businesses through subsidiaries and
affiliates worldwide some of which have significant minority interests  in
addition their global growth strategies include investments in markets
worldwide including those in central and eastern europe the peoples republic
of china russia brazil south korea and other countries which involve a
higher degree of currency political and economic risk than investments in more
developed markets

   the us and worldwide operations of otis and carrier can be affected by
changes in economic industrial political weather and international
conditions including changes in interest rates which can affect demand for
products and services changes in technology changes in legislation and
government policies including those related to investments exchange controls
repatriation of earnings and in the case of carrier regulation of
refrigerants changes in the level of construction activity changes in
exchange rates changes in labor costs which can affect otis service and
maintenance margins and raw material costs and competition from a large number
of companies in the united states and other countries  carriers operations can
also be affected by changes in the level of production and utilization of
transport equipment in the level of retail sales of perishable food products
and in fuel prices  the principal methods of competition are price delivery
schedule product performance and service

pratt  whitney and flight systems aerospace and defense products
   pratt  whitney and flight systems produce aerospace and defense products
sales of these products are subject to changes in technology lengthy and costly
development cycles the effects of consolidation in the aerospace and defense
industry heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs changes
in legislation including restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions
and in government procurement practices policies of some foreign customers
which require offset programs incountry purchases manufacturing and financial
support projects required as a condition to obtaining orders or other
arrangements substantial competition from domestic manufacturers foreign
manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development
assistance marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial
products and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture
spare parts and changes in economic industrial and international conditions
in addition the financial performance of these two segments can be affected in
a number of respects by the general level of activity and performance of the
commercial airline industry and the aviation industry and by changes in fuel
prices  the international operations of these segments are subject to local
government regulations including regulations relating to investments exchange
controls and repatriation of earnings as well as to varying currency political
and economic risks  sales of military products are affected by defense budgets
both in the us and abroad and us foreign policy  military spare parts
sales are also affected by policies of the us and foreign governments of
purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturers

   the principal methods of competition in the corporations aerospace and
defense businesses are price product performance service delivery schedule
and other terms and conditions of sale including discounts and other financial
incentives performance and operating cost guarantees maintenance agreements
and participation in financing arrangements for commercial jet engines and
helicopters  engine selections by airlines airframe manufacturers and
operators can have a significant impact on sales of spare parts and maintenance
services  significant elements of pratt  whitneys and flight systems
business such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service have
short lead times  therefore backlog information may not be indicative of
future demand  also since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial
customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2001 changes in economic conditions
may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled

   in 2000 the corporation announced its participation in the formation of
myaircraft a joint venture to develop a businesstobusiness ecommerce
marketplace for aerospace aftermarket products and services
ecommerce business models are subject to significant risks due to rapid changes
in technology business practices and customer acceptance as well as
substantial competition from other ecommerce initiatives  these ecommerce
exchanges can also have a significant impact on the manner in which the
corporation sells parts and services

pratt  whitney
   pratt  whitney is one of the worlds leading producers of commercial
general aviation and military aircraft engines  pratt  whitney provides
overhaul and repair services spare parts and fleet management services for the

announced the launch of the a380 aircraft formerly known as the a3xx with
first deliveries scheduled for 2006

   manufacturers of many commercial aircraft offer their customers a choice of
engines giving rise to competition among engine manufacturers at the time of
sale of aircraft  this competition is intense particularly for new commercial
airframeengine combinations and can result in offers by engine suppliers of
substantial financial incentives performance and operating cost guarantees and
maintenance agreements  pratt  whitneys major competitors in the sale of
engines are the aircraft engine businesses of general electric company and rolls
royce plc  for information regarding customer financing commitments
participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance

sales representatives  sales to boeing and airbus were each 15 percent of total
pratt  whitney revenues in 2000 before taking into account discounts or
financial incentives offered to customers

   pratt  whitney currently produces two military aircraft engines the f100
powering f15 and f16 fighter aircraft and the f117 powering c17 transport
aircraft  all of pratt  whitneys f100 sales contracts are with the united
states air force usaf or with foreign governments  all of pratt  whitneys
f117 sales contracts are with either the usaf or boeing    pratt  whitney is
also under contract with the usaf to develop the f119 engine the only
anticipated source of propulsion for the twoengine f22 fighter aircraft being
developed by lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin and boeing  in
addition both contractors boeing and lockheed martin that were selected to
proceed into the next phase of the joint strike fighter development program have
selected derivatives of pratt  whitneys f119 engine to power their competing
demonstration aircraft  management cannot predict with certainty whether when
and in what quantities pratt  whitney will produce f119 engines

other
   the corporations international fuel cells unit ifc is a world leader in
fuel cell production and development for commercial transportation residential
and space applications  ifc is the sole supplier of fuel cells for us space
missions and also offers a commercially available fuel cell power plant known
as the pc25 trademark symbol

   the pc25 is a 200 kilowatt stationary fuel cell power plant with a
phosphoric acid cell stack  over 200 pc25 units have been delivered around
the world  fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology
pem are currently in development for transportation commercial stationary
and residential applications  ifc is working with five automakers and two
bus manufacturers as well as the us department of energy on development
and demonstration programs for automobiles

   although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power
generators in terms of efficiency and environmental characteristics current
production rates remain low across the industry  continued technology
advancement and wider market acceptance are required to reduce the production
cost of fuel cell components and power plants  there is still significant
uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable pem fuel cells will be
produced  ifc continues to seek strategic partners to develop sources of
supply as well as marketing and distribution channels  toshiba corporation
owns a 13 percent equity interest in ifc

   the results of ifc are included in the eliminations and other category in

        other matters relating to the corporations business as a whole

research and development
   to maintain its competitive position the corporation spends substantial
amounts of its own funds on research and development  such expenditures which
are charged to income as incurred were 1302 million or 50 percent of total
sales in 2000 as compared with 1292 million or 54 percent of total sales in
1999 and 1168 million or 51 percent of total sales in 1998  the corporation
also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the us
government and other customers  such contract research and development which
is performed principally in the pratt  whitney segment and to a lesser extent
in the flight systems segment amounted to 1004 million in 2000 as compared
with 1044 million in 1999 and 1065 million in 1998

contracts other risk factors environmental and other matters
   government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the
government in which event the corporation normally would be entitled to
reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus a reasonable profit  most
of the corporations sales are made under fixedprice type contracts only 4
percent of the corporations total sales for 2000 were made under cost
reimbursement type contracts

   like many defense contractors the corporation has received allegations from
the us government that some contract prices should be reduced because cost or
pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices may not have been
in conformance with government regulations  the corporation has made voluntary
refunds in those cases it believes appropriate has settled some allegations
and does not believe that any further price reductions that may be required will
have a material effect upon its financial position results of operations or
cash flows

   the corporation is now and believes that in light of the current government
contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more government
investigations  see item 3  legal proceedings on pages 9 and 10 of this form
10k and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements on page 22 of the
corporations 2000 annual report to shareowners for further discussion

   the diversification of the corporations businesses across industries and
geographically throughout the world has helped to limit in varying degrees the
effect of adverse conditions in any one industry or the economy of any country
or region on the consolidated results of the corporation  there can be no
assurance however that the effect of adverse conditions in one or more
industries or regions will be limited or offset in the future

   like other users in the us the corporation is largely dependent upon
foreign sources for certain of its raw materials requirements such as cobalt
africa and chromium africa eastern and central europe and the countries of
the former soviet union  to alleviate this dependence and accompanying risk
the corporation has a number of ongoing programs which include the development
of new suppliers the increased use of more readily available materials through
material substitutions and the development of new alloys and the conservation
of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes such as
net shape forging

   the corporation has sought cost reductions in its purchases of certain other
materials components and supplies by consolidating its purchases reducing the
number of suppliers and using online bidding competitions among potential
suppliers  in some instances the corporation is reliant upon a single source
of supply  a disruption in deliveries from its suppliers therefore could have
an adverse effect on the corporations ability to meet its commitments to
customers  the corporation believes that it has appropriately balanced the
risks against the costs of sustaining a greater number of suppliers  the
corporation does not foresee any unavailability of materials components or
supplies which will have any material adverse effect on its overall business or
on any of its business segments in the near term

   the corporation does not anticipate that compliance with current federal
state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment will
have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows competitive position
financial position or results of operations  environmental matters are the
subject of certain of the legal matters described in item 3  legal proceedings
on pages 9 and 10 of this form 10k and are further addressed in managements
discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial position on page
7 and notes 1 and 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 15
and 22 of the corporations 2000 annual report to shareowners

   most of the laws governing environmental matters include criminal
provisions  if the corporation were convicted of a violation of the federal
clean air act or the clean water act the facility or facilities involved in the
violation would be listed on the environmental protection agencys epa list
of violating facilities  the listing would continue until the epa concluded
that the cause of the violation had been cured  listed facilities cannot be
used in performing any us government contract awarded to the corporation
during any period of listing by the epa

   while the corporations patents trademarks licenses and franchises are
cumulatively important to its business the corporation does not believe that
the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks licenses or
franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of the
corporation or on any of its operating segments

are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current
business environment are being appropriately utilized consistent with
experience and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended
purposes  utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the
products  the corporation continuously reviews its anticipated requirements
for facilities and based on that review may from time to time acquire
additional facilities andor dispose of existing facilities



item 3  legal proceedings

     as previously reported the department of defense and the corporation are
litigating whether pratt  whitneys accounting practices for certain engine
parts are acceptable  the litigation filed with the armed services board of
contract appeals asbca no 47416 et al relates to the accounting for
engine parts produced by foreign companies under commercial engine collaboration
programs from 1984 through 1995  in december 1996 the government claimed
damages of 1576 million plus 1027 million in interest through 1996  pratt
 whitney believes its accounting practices are proper and has not modified
them  in march and april 1998 the matter was tried before an asbca judge  a
decision is anticipated in 2001  should the government prevail on liability
damages could be larger than initially claimed because the government may amend
its claim to include the period after 1995 and interest continues to accrue on
the claim asserted in 1996

   as previously reported a jury in chromalloy gas turbine corporation v
united technologies corporation no 95ci12541 a texas state action found
that pratt  whitney did not monopolize any relevant market but did willfully
attempt to monopolize an unspecified market  in may 1997 the court entered a
final judgment denying chromalloys request for damages injunctive relief and
declaratory relief  in october 1998 the texas fourth court of appeals affirmed
the decision of the trial court declining to grant injunctive relief to
chromalloy  in november 1999 the appellate court denied chromalloys motions
for rehearing and rehearing en banc  in march 2000 chromalloy filed a petition
for review with the texas supreme court  in december 2000 the texas supreme
court denied chromalloys petition for review  in january 2001 chromalloy
filed a motion for rehearing with the texas supreme court

   as previously reported the corporation has been served with two qui tam
complaints under the civil false claims act in united states district court for
the district of connecticut  us ex rel drake v norden systems inc and
utc no394cv00963 filed july 1997 and involving allegations of improper
accounting for fixed assets and us ex rel capella v utc and norden systems
inc no 394cv02063 filed december 1994 and involving allegations of improper
accounting for insurance costs  the civil false claims act provides for
penalties in a civil case of up to 10000 per false claim submitted  the
number of false claims implicated by the foregoing qui tam complaints cannot
currently be ascertained however if determined adversely to the corporation
the number could result in significant penalties  the qui tam relator in each
case has claimed unspecified damages trebled and penalties and the department
of justice in each case has declined to take over the litigation  in august
2000 the court dismissed portions of the complaints

   in march 1999 the department of justice filed a civil false claims act
complaint against the corporation in united states district court for the
southern district of ohio western division no c399093  this lawsuit is
related to the fighter engine competition between pratt  whitneys f100
engine and ges f110 engine for contracts awarded by the us air force between
fiscal years 1985 and 1990 inclusive  the government alleges that pratt
 whitney inflated its estimated costs for purchased parts and withheld data
that would have revealed the overstatements  the government seeks damages of
at least 95 million some portion of which would be trebled plus penalties
of up to 10000 per claim submitted

   the corporation does not believe that resolution of any of the foregoing
legal matters will have a material adverse effect upon the corporations
competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial position

   the corporation is now and believes that in light of the current government
contracting environment it will be the subject of one or more government
investigations  if the corporation or one of its business units were charged
with wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations the corporation or
one of its business units could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards
of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings  if
convicted or found liable the corporation could be fined and debarred from new
government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years  any
contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the government

   the corporation has incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities
under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants
previously released into the environment  the corporation believes that any
payments it may be required to make as a result of these claims will not have a
material effect upon the cash flows competitive or financial position or
results of operations of the corporation  for information regarding the
